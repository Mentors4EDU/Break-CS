# Break-CS
Want to break the theoretical limits for Lossless and Lossy data compression
### This readme is just for the fileproof, this algo isn't going to be on git

The original file which we needed to compress with 7Zip was 100MB down to the lowest available 33.2MB

Original: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kSK2tyMuqp2DfQhkuiVn28rAHSscmTnN/view?usp=sharing

We were able to compress up to 4MB and can "theoretically" go up to 3 bytes (Proofs attached)

But aren't willing to open source a decompressor
