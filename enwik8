      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Anarchism}}
'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.

The word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. 
    
While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. 

== Origins and predecessors ==

[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William Godwin]]

Anarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto). ''Taoism and Anarchy.'' [[April 14]] [[2002]] [http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm Toxicpop mirror] [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/5705/taoan.html Vanity site mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], Murray. ''&quot;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ancient-chinese.html The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition]&quot;'', an extract from ''&quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire]&quot;'', The Journal of Libertarian Studies, 9 (2) Fall 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] found similar ideas in [[stoicism|stoic]] [[Zeno of Citium]]. According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Am√©rique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;

In 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].

==The first self-labelled anarchist==
[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]
{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}

It is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propri√©t√©), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. 

Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.

Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''

==Max Stirner's Egoism==
{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}

In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

==American individualist anarchism==
[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}

In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)

[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin. ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. 

Other 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].

==The First International==
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]
{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. 

From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]

==Anarchist Communism==
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph D√©jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'√™tre-humain m√¢le et femelle - Lettre √† P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D√©jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H√©ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unit√© associ√©e au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F√©lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon ‚Äî authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928‚Äì)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently √©litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol√°s Rossell√≥]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

'''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior. 

Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.

Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways.

By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]] also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the [[scientific community]].

Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as part of who they are.

==History==
[[image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]

The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.

However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943 psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''), meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'', almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.

At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.

Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].

Few clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a [[diagnosis]].

==Terminology==
{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}
When referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead. This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).

==Characteristics==
[[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]] can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.

Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.

===Social development===
Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children.

Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.

Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]] of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children. 

Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.

===Sensory system===
A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.

One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.

It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.

===Communication difficulties===
By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].

Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. 
Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.

The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.

Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.

===Effects in education===
Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people‚Äôs thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. 

Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create ‚Äúvisual schedules‚Äù for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. 

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.

A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. 

There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child‚Äôs disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.

Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.

== DSM definition ==
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:
#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 
##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
###lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) 
###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language 
###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level
##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) 
###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. 
#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.  (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.

== Types of autism == 
Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high-functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to [[IQ]].  The terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels.  Further, these two labels are not currently used or accepted in autism literature.

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA. For example, some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all, because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible.

As a consequence, many &quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic persons, and autistic people with a relatively high [[IQ]], are underdiagnosed, thus making the claim that &quot;autism implies retardation&quot; self-fulfilling. The number of people diagnosed with LFA is not rising quite as sharply as HFA, indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics.

=== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ===
[[Image:Hans Asperger.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Asperger described his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]]
In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot; in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.

===Autism as a spectrum disorder===
{{details|Autistic spectrum}}

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child's body.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==
{{details|Autism epidemic}}

[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]
There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.

Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).

Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference below).

The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the number of incidences of autism.

One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled &quot;The [[Geek]] Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.

Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].

== Therapies ==
{{details|Autism therapies}}

==Sociology==
Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.

===Community and politics===
{{details|Autistic community}}
{{details|Autism rights movement}}

Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'', and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.

There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will help out children with autism, much in the way a master would help out an apprentice, for example.

2002 was declared [[Autism Awareness Year]] in the [[United Kingdom]]&amp;mdash;this idea was initiated by [[Ivan and Charika Corea]], parents of an autistic child, Charin. Autism Awareness Year was led by the [[British Institute of Brain Injured Children]],  [[Disabilities Trust]],  [[National Autistic Society]],  [[Autism London]] and 800 organizations in the United Kingdom. It had the personal backing of [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister  [[Tony Blair]] and parliamentarians of all parties in the [[Palace of Westminster]].

===Culture===
{{details|Autistic culture}}
With the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics, an ''autistic culture'' has begun to develop.  Similar to [[deaf culture]], autistic culture is based in a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured.  There are some commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture, not just &quot;autistic culture&quot;.

It is a common misperception that people with autism do not marry; many do get married.  Often, they marry another person with autism, although this is not always the case.  Many times autistics are attracted to other autistics due to shared interests or obsessions, but more often than not the attraction is due to simple compatibility with personality types, the same as is true for non-autistics. Autistics who communicate have explained that companionship is as important to autistics as it is to anyone else. Multigenerational autistic families have also recently become a bit more common.

The interests of autistic people and so-called &quot;[[geeks]]&quot; or &quot;[[Nerd|nerds]]&quot; can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects, much like the variant normal behavior geeks experience.  However, in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in groups, which impairs them even in the most &quot;technical&quot; of situations.

===Autistic adults===
[[image:Grandin2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Temple Grandin]], one of the more successful adults with autism. 
&lt;small&gt;Photograph courtesy  Joshua Nathaniel Pritikin and William Lawrence Jarrold.&lt;/small&gt;]]

Some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs, usually those with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of the autistic's life. Other autistics are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives. Some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to communicate and form online communities, in addition to being able to find occupations such as independent consulting, which does generally not require much human interaction offline.

In the [[United States]], the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is in their 20s, depending on each state. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

=== Autistic savants ===
{{Main|autistic savant}}
The autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people. The term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has extreme talent in a certain area of study.  Although there is a common association between savants and autism (an association created by the 1988 film ''[[Rain Man]]''), most autistic people are not [[savants]]. [[Mental calculator]]s and fast [[programming]] skills are the most common form. The famous example is [[Daniel Tammet]], the subject of the [[documentary film]] ''[[The Brain Man]]'' {{ref|guardianbrainman}} ([[Kim Peek]], one of the inspirations for [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character in the film ''[[Rain Man]]'', is not autistic). &quot;Bright Splinters of the Mind&quot; is a book that explores this issue further.

== Other pervasive developmental disorders ==
Autism and Asperger's syndrome are just two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). The three other pervasive developmental disorders are [[Rett syndrome]], [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]], and [[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]]. Some of these are related to autism, while some of them are entirely separate conditions.

=== Rett syndrome ===
[[Rett syndrome]] is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses; she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of these early symptoms may be confused for autism. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. [[Physical therapy|Physical]], [[Occupational therapy|occupational]], and [[Speech therapy|speech]] therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and [[speech]].

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene causes Rett syndrome, and can physically test for it with a 80% accuracy rate {{ref|nihrett}}. Rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder, however most scientists agree that Rett syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and not part of the autistic spectrum {{ref|brighttotsrett}}.

===Childhood disintegrative disorder===
[[Childhood disintegrative disorder]] (CDD, and sometimes abbreviated as CHDD also) is a condition appearing in 3 or 4 year old children who have developed normally until age 2. Over several months, the child will deteriorate in intellectual, social, and language functioning from previously normal behaviour.  This long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome (and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing). The cause for CDD is unknown (thus it may be a spectrum disorder) but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system {{ref|yalecdd}} {{ref|nihcdd}}.

===  Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ===
[[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]], or PDD-NOS, is referred to as a ''subthreshold'' condition because it is a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders, PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to none at all. Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis, just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while PDD-NOS is an official diagnosis {{ref|yalepddnos}}.

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45¬∞N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45¬∞N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 ¬∞C (-240 ¬∞F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 ¬∞C (9 ¬∞F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

'''Abu Dhabi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: &amp;#1571;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1608; &amp;#1592;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1610; ''&amp;#700;Ab&amp;#363; &amp;#7826;aby'') is the largest of the seven [[emirate]]s that comprise the [[United Arab Emirates]] and was also the largest of the former [[Trucial States]]. '''Abu Dhabi''' is also a city of the same name within the Emirate that is the [[capital city|capital]] of the country, in north central UAE.  The city lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the [[Persian Gulf]] from the central western coast. An estimated 1,000,000 lived there in 2000, with about an 80% [[expatriate]] population. Abu Dhabi city is located at {{coor d|24.4667|N|54.3667|E}}. [[Al Ain]] is Abu Dhabi's second largest urban area with a population of 348,000 ([[2003]] census estimate) and is located 150 kilometres inland.
 
==History==
Parts of Abu Dhabi were settled as far back as the [[3rd millennium BC]] and its early history fits the nomadic, herding and fishing pattern typical of the broader region. Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation the Bani Yas in the late 18th century, who also assumed control of [[Dubai]]. In the 19th century the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.

Into the mid-20th century, the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by camel herding, production of dates and vegetables at the inland oases of [[Al Ain]] and Liwa, and fishing and pearl diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city, which was occupied mainly during the summer months.  Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were, at this time constructed of palm fronds (barasti), with the better-off families occupying mud huts.  The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the 20th century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings.  

In 1939, Sheikh [[Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan]] granted [[Petroleum]] concessions, and oil was first found in 1958.  At first, oil money had a marginal impact.  A few lowrise concete buildings were erected, and the first paved road was completed in 1961, but Sheikh Shakbut, uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last, took a cautious approach, prefering to save the revenue rather than investing it in development.  His brother, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan]], saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi.  The ruling Al Nahayan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as Ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country.  On [[August 6]], [[1966]], with the assistance of the British, Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler.  See generally, Al-Fahim, M, ''From Rags to Riches: A Story of Abu Dhabi'', Chapter Six (London Centre of Arab Studies, 1995), ISBN 1 900404 00 1.

With the announcement by Britain in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Gulf area by 1971, Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the [[United Arab Emirates]].

After the Emirates gained independence in 1971, oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional [[Mudbrick|mud-brick]] [[hut]]s were rapidly replaced with [[banks]], boutiques and modern [[highrise]]s.

==Current ruler==
His Highness Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan]] is the hereditary [[Emir|emir]] and ruler of Abu Dhabi, as well as the current president of the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).

==Postal History==
[[Image:Stamp_Abu_1967_40f-170px.jpg|right|170px|thumb|[[Shaikh]] [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan|Zaid]], [[1967]].]]
Now part of the [[United Arab Emirates]], '''Abu Dhabi''' was formerly the largest of the seven sheikdoms which made up the [[Trucial States]] on the so-called [[Pirate Coast]] of eastern [[Arabia]] between [[Oman]] and [[Qatar]].  The [[Trucial States]] as a whole had an area of some 32,000 square miles of which Abu Dhabi alone had 26,000.  The capital was the town of Abu Dhabi which is on an offshore island and was first settled in 1761.

The name [[Trucial States]] arose from [[treaties]] made with [[Great Britain]] in 1820 which ensured a condition of [[truce]] in the area and the suppression of [[piracy]] and [[slavery]].  The [[treaty]] expired on [[31 December]] [[1966]].  The decision to form the [[UAE]] was made on [[18 July]] [[1971]] and the [[federation]] was founded on [[1 August]] [[1972]], although the inaugural [[UAE]] stamps were not issued until [[1 January]] [[1973]].

[[petroleum|Oil]] production began on [[Das Island]] after [[prospecting]] during 1956-1960.  [[Das Island]] is part of Abu Dhabi but lies well [[offshore]], about 100 miles north of the mainland.  [[petroleum|Oil]] production on the [[mainland]] began in 1962.  As a major [[petroleum|oil]] producer, Abu Dhabi soon acquired massive [[financial]] wealth.  [[Investment]] in long-term [[construction]] projects and the establishment of a [[finance]] sector has led to the area becoming a centre of [[commerce]] which may well secure its lasting importance when the [[petroleum|oil]] resources are exhausted.

In December 1960, [[postage stamps]] of [[Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Brit - British)#British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia|British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia]] were supplied to the [[construction]] workers on [[Das Island]] but the [[postal service]] was administered via the agency office in [[Bahrain]].  The [[mail]] was also [[postmark]]ed [[Bahrain]] so there was no clear indication that a [[letter]] had come from [[Das Island]].

On [[30 March]] [[1963]], a British agency was opened in Abu Dhabi and issued the agency stamps after the sheik objected to the use of the [[Trucial States]] [[definitive]]s.  [[Mail]] from [[Das Island]] continued to be administered by [[Bahrain]] but was now cancelled by an Abu Dhabi [[Trucial States]] [[postmark]].

The first Abu Dhabi stamps were a [[definitive series]] of [[30 March]] [[1964]] depicting [[Shaikh]] [[Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan]].  There were eleven values under the [[India|Indian]] [[currency]] that was used of 100 [[paisa|naye paise]] = 1 [[rupee]].  The range of values was 5 np to 10 [[rupee]]s.  Despite the introduction of these [[definitive]]s, the British agency stamps remained valid in both Abu Dhabi and [[Das Island]] until the end of 1966 when they were withdrawn.

A [[post office]] was opened on [[Das Island]] on [[6 January]] [[1966]] and this ended the [[Bahrain]] service.  [[Mail]] from [[Das Island]] was now handled within Abu Dhabi.

When the [[treaty]] with [[Great Britain]] expired at the end of 1966, Abu Dhabi introduced a new [[currency]] of 1000 [[fils]] = 1 [[dinar]] and took over its own postal administration, including the [[Das Island]] office. The earlier issues were subject to [[surcharge]]s in this [[currency]] and replacement [[definitive]]s were released depicting the new ruler [[Shaikh]] [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan|Zaid]].  Issues continued until introduction of [[UAE]] stamps in 1973.

In all, Abu Dhabi issued 95 stamps from 1964 to 1972, the final set being three views of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]].

==Climate==
Sunny/blue skies can be expected through-out the year. The months June through September are generally hot and humid with temperatures averaging above 40¬∫C(110¬∫F). The weather is usually pleasant from October to May. January to February is cooler and may require the use of a light jacket. The oasis city of [[Al Ain]] enjoys cooler temperatures even through summer due to [[sporadic]] rainfall.

==Transport==
[[Abu Dhabi International Airport]] serves this city. The local time is [[GMT]] + 4 hours.

==Trivia==
* The cartoon cat [[Garfield]] would often put the kitten [[Nermal]] in a box and ship him to Abu Dhabi. A common phrase from Garfield is &quot;Abu Dhabi is where all the cute kittens go.&quot; The reason is that the author of Garfield found out through over-seas relations that the city of Abu Dhabi, and the majority of UAE, has a large amount of cats that roam wild. Many live around the suburbs.

The letter '''A''' is the first letter in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] is ''a'', plural ''aes,'' ''a's,'' or ''as''.

==History==
The letter A probably started as a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s or the [[Proto-semitic alphabet]].

{| align=&quot;center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[Image:EgyptianA-01.png|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]&lt;br /&gt;Egyptian hieroglyph&lt;br /&gt;ox head
|[[Image:Proto-semiticA-01.png|Proto-semitic ox head]]&lt;br /&gt;Proto-semitic&lt;br /&gt;ox head
|[[Image:PhoenicianA-01.png|Phoenician aleph]]&lt;br /&gt;Phoenician ''aleph''
|[[Image:GreekA-01.png|Greek alpha]]&lt;br /&gt;Greek ''alpha''
|[[Image:EtruscanA-01.png|Etruscan A]]&lt;br /&gt;Etruscan A
|[[Image:RomanA-01.png|Roman A]]&lt;br /&gt;Roman A
|}

By [[1600 BC]], the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for all later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] [[Aleph (letter)|aleph]]. The name is also similar to the Arabic [[Alif|alif.]]

When the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in Phoenician and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign for the vowel {{IPA|/&amp;#593;/}}, and changed its name to [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions, dating to the [[8th century BC]], the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to what was [[Italy]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

The letter has two [[minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke. Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it. Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version below. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Usage==
In [[English language|English]], the letter A by itself usually denotes the [[lax open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|√¶}}) as in ''pad'', the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|…ë}}) as in ''father'', or, in concert with a later orthographic [[e]], the diphthong {{IPA2|e ≤}} (though the pronunciation varies with the dialect) as in ''ace'', due to effects of the [[Great vowel shift]].

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter A denotes either an [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|…ë}}), or an [[open central unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|a}}). 

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of the letter A denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital A denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase a denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].

A also is the English [[indefinite article]], extended to [[an]] before a vowel.

In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] A is codepoint U+0041 and the [[minuscule|lowercase]] a is U+0061.

In [[Hexadecimal|Hex]], A is the character used to represent decimal 10, or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]], 01010

The [[ASCII]] code for capital A is 65 and for lowercase a is 97; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000001 and 01100001, correspondingly.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital A is 193 and for lowercase a is 129.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#65;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#97;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case respectively.

'''Alabama''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[United States]].

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Alabama]]''

The memory of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] presence is particularly strong in Alabama. Among Native American people once living in present Alabama were [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (Alibamu), [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobile (people)|Mobile]].  Trade with the Northeast via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period  ([[1000 BC]]-A.D. [[700]]) and continued until European contact.  Meso-American influence is evident in the agrarian Mississippian culture that followed.

The [[France|French]] established the first [[Europe]]an settlement in the state with the establishment of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[1702]].  Southern Alabama was French from [[1702]]&amp;ndash;[[1763]], part of British West Florida from [[1763]]&amp;ndash;[[1780]], and part of Spanish West Florida from [[1780]]&amp;ndash;[[1814]]. Northern and central Alabama was part of British Georgia from [[1763]]&amp;ndash;[[1783]] and part of the American Mississippi territory thereafter. Its statehood delayed by the lack of a coastline (rectified when Andrew Jackson captured Spanish Mobile in [[1814]]), Alabama became the 22nd state in [[1819]].

The state of Alabama seceded from the Union on [[January 11]], [[1861]] and became the [[Alabama Republic]] and on [[February 18]] [[1861]] became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]].  While not many battles were fought in the state, it contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].  After the war a provisional government was set up in [[1865]] and Alabama was officially readmitted to the Union on July 14 [[1868]].

The cradle of the Confederacy during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]], Alabama was at stage center in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] of the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]].

==Law and government==
''Main article: [[Law and Government of Alabama]]''
===Local &amp; County Government===
Alabama has 67 [[county|counties]], each having its own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.  Due to the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but 7 counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]].  Instead, most counties in the state have to lobby to the Local Legislation Committee the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an alcohol monopoly or [[Alcoholic beverage control state]].

===Political Climate===
The current governor of the state is [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]] and the two U.S. senators are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]] (all three from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]).  The current [[Alabama Constitution]] was adopted in [[1901]].

During [[Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In [[1877]], the Reconstruction period ended with the recognition of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as President-elect. [[White people|White]] Southerners assumed control of the government and passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents.  The state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]],&quot; a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state.  For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally no Republican challenger running. 

From [[1876]] through [[1956]], Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by margins as high as 73 percentage points.  In [[1960]], Alabama gave most of its electoral votes to [[Harry F. Byrd]] as a protest.  In [[1964]], the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] began to win more votes in the South by following a &quot;[[Southern Strategy]]&quot; which emphasized &quot;[[States' rights|states' rights]]&quot; and the increasing liberalism of the national Democratic Party.  The first such candidate was conservative [[Barry Goldwater]], who became the first Republican candidate supported by Alabama.  In [[1968]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]].  

The last Democratic candidate to win Alabama's votes in a presidential election was Southerner [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1976]].  Today, the Republican party has become increasingly dominant in conservative Alabama politics. However, in local politics, Democrats still control many offices, including majorities in both houses of the Legislature, and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state.  In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote.  The only 11 counties voting Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are in the majority.

Alabama is located in the [[Bible Belt]], and its educational policies reflect this. According to the [[Alan Guttmacher Institute]], Alabama requires sex education classes to emphasize &quot;that [[homosexuality]] is not an acceptable lifestyle to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state.&quot; While the mandate is not typically enforced in Alabama classrooms, it is unclear whether or not the official requirements have changed since the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Lawrence v. Texas]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2000, Alabama was home to 4,561 same-sex male couples and 4,167 same-sex female couples.

==Geography==
''Main article: [[Geography of Alabama]]''

{{ussm|alabama.PNG|al}}
Alabama is the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest state in the United States with 135,775 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (52,423 mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of total area.  3.19% of that is water, making Alabama 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the [[United States]].  About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle [[plain]] with a general incline towards the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  The [[North Alabama]] region is mostly mountainous, with the [[Tennessee River]] cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.  The lowest point east of the [[Mississippi River]] lies in [[Dekalb County]] along a creek cutting tower ridges, and creating [[Buck's Pocket State Park]].  Another natural wonder is &quot;Land Bridge&quot; the longest natural bridge span east of the [[Mississippi River]].  Alabama generally ranges in [[elevation]] from [[sea level]] at [[Mobile Bay]], to a little more than 1800 [[foot (unit)|feet]] or 550 [[metre|meters]] in the Appalachian mountains in the northeast.  The highest point is [[Mount Cheaha]].

==Economy==
[[Image:wiki_alabama.jpg|thumb|275px|Greetings from Alabama]]
According to the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the [[2003]] total [[gross state product]] was $132 billion. The [[per capita income]] for the state was $26,505 in 2003. Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include [[poultry]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[cattle]], plant nursery items, [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[grains]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[sorgum]], [[vegetables]], [[milk]], [[soybeans]], and [[peaches]]. Even though neighboring [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] is called the [[Peach State]], Alabama produces twice as many peaches annually. Its [[Industry|industrial]] outputs include [[iron]] and [[steel]] products, including cast-iron and steel pipe, [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[wood]] products, [[mining]] (mostly coal), and [[plastic]] products, cars and trucks, and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, home of the [[NASA]] [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Also, the city of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and with inland waterway access to the Midwest via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].

[[Image:The_wrath_of_Achilles.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The wrath of Achilles, by L√©on Benouville]]{{Greek myth}}In [[Greek mythology]], '''{{polytonic|&amp;#7944;œáŒπŒªŒªŒµœçœÇ}}''', transliterated to '''Akhilleus''' or '''Achilleus'' in Roman letters, Latinized from this ancient Greek to '''Achilles''', appearing in Etruscan as '''Achle''', was a [[hero]] (ancient Greek heros, &quot;defender&quot;) of the [[Trojan War]], the greatest and the most [[central character]] of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. 

==Name==
The very first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{Polytonic|Œº·øÜŒΩŒπŒΩ ·ºÑŒµŒπŒ¥Œµ Œ∏Œµ·Ω∞ Œ†Œ∑ŒªŒ∑œäŒ¨Œ¥Œµœâ ·ºàœáŒπŒª·øÜŒøœÇ}}
:{{Polytonic|Œø·ΩêŒªŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ, ·º£ ŒºœÖœÅŒØ' ·ºàœáŒ±ŒπŒø·øñœÇ ·ºÑŒªŒ≥Œµ' ·ºîŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ,}}
Transliterated:
:Mƒìnin aeide thea, Pƒìlƒìiade≈ç Akhilƒìos
:oulomenƒìn, hƒì muri' Akhaiois alge' ethƒìken,
Translated:
:Sing, Muse, the wrath of Achilles the son of Peleus,
:the destructive wrath, that brought countless griefs upon the Achaeans,
[[Image:G-achilles-trojan-wars-bb-l.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Achilles]]In these lines, we see the name Akhilleus Peleides, which is a [[praenomen]] and a [[patronymic]], the latter being formed from Peleus with the suffix -ides producing ''Achilles the son of [[Peleus]]''. The system is similar to the names used by [[Scandinavians]] before modern times, such as Leif Erikson. 


Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{Polytonic|·ºÑœáŒøœÇ}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{Polytonic|ŒªŒ±œåœÇ}} (''laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; [http://www.stanford.edu/group/shl/Crowds/hist/laos.htm]  In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers''. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

==Birth==
Achilles was the son of the mortal [[Peleus]], king of the [[Myrmidons]] in [[Phthia]] (southeast [[Thessaly]]), and the sea nymph [[Thetis]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]] the fire-bringer prophesized that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed to Peleus.

When Achilles was born, according to the most common version of the myth, Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]]. But she forgot to wet the heel she held him by, leaving him vulnerable at that spot. (See [[Achilles' tendon]].) In an earlier and less popular version of the story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage. Homer does not make reference to this invulnerability in the [[Iliad]]. To the contrary, he mentions Achilles being wounded, although not seriously.

Peleus gave him (together with his young friend or lover [[Patroclus]]) to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be raised.

==Achilles in the Trojan War==
===Telephus===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;.

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. This is an example of [[sympathetic magic]].

===During the Trojan War===
[[Image:The_Rage_of_Achilles_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|‚ÄúThe Rage of Achilles‚Äù by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].]]

In Homer's Iliad, Achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage (''menon'').  His anger is at some times wavering, at other times absolute.  The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

Achilles' [[charioteer]]'s name was [[Automedon]].

====Troilus====
According to [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'' [http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html], while [[Troilus]], the youngest son of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]] (whom some say was fathered by [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]), was watering his horses at the Lion Fountain outside the walls of Troy, Achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty (whose &quot;loveliness of form&quot; was described by [[Ibycus]] as being like &quot;gold thrice refined&quot;). The youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of Apollo. Achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god's own altar. ([[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], [[scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]]). At the time, Troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday, and the legend goes that if Troilus had lived to be twenty, Troy would have been invincible. ([[First Vatican Mythographer]])

====Agamemnon and the death of Patroclus====
[[Image:Patrocluspederastyscene.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Patroclus]] and Achilles. Achilles bandages the arm of his friend Patroclus. The latter turns his head aside to avoid the sight of blood and of Achilles noticing his pain grimaces. The scene has been interpreted as an act of welfare and comradeship, or as a scene with sexual overtones. Ancient Greek culture often held the two [[Iliad#The_relationship_of_Achilles_and_Patroclus|to be lovers]].]]

Achilles took 23 towns outside [[Troy]], including [[Lyrnessos]], where he captured [[Briseis]] to keep as a [[concubine]]. Meanwhile, [[Agamemnon]] took a woman named [[Chryseis]] and taunted her father, [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], when he attempted to buy her back. Apollo sent a plague through the Greek armies, and Agamemnon was forced to give Chryseis back to her father; however, he took Briseis away from Achilles as compensation for his loss.

This action sparked the central plot of the [[Iliad]]: Achilles becomes enraged and refuses to fight for the Greeks any further. The war goes badly, through the influence of [[Zeus]], and the Greeks offer handsome reparations to their greatest warrior.  After the Greeks are pushed back to the ships, which are just starting to be set on fire by the Trojan hero [[Hector]], Achilles is visited by [[Odysseus]], [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]], and [[Phoenix (Iliad)|Phoenix]], who attempt to persuade him to return to battle.  

Achilles still refuses to fight, but agrees to allow [[Patroclus]] to fight in his place, wearing his armor. The next day, [[Patroclus]] is killed and stripped of the armor by Hector, who mistakes him for Achilles. Achilles is overwhelmed with grief for his beloved friend, and the rage he once harbored toward Agamemnon begins shifting to Hector. Thetis, his mother, rises from the sea floor and sympathizes with his grief. She obtains magnificent new armor for him from [[Hephaestus]]. The goddess [[Athena]] provides him with the [[aegis]] of Zeus.

When he goes to the battlefield, the entire Trojan army flees behind the walls of Troy. Achilles' wrath is terrible, and he slays many Trojan warriors and allies, including Priam's son [[Lycaon]] (whom Achilles had previously captured and sold into slavery, but who had been returned to Troy). Eventually Hector comes out of the walls to defend the honour of Troy. He asked Achilles to agree that the body of the loser would be returned for proper burial by the winner. Achilles rejected this arrangement, saying,  &quot;Though twenty ransoms and thy weight in gold were offered, I would refuse it all.&quot; 

Stories tell that Hector ran about Troy seven times and Achilles followed him, however seeing that Achilles would not be outrun, Hector stood his ground and fought. Other versions of the tale say that Achilles chased after Hector two times, and one time he was delivered by the gods, however, on their second encounter, Achilles trapped Hector and challenged him. After a legendary fight, Achilles kills Hector.

Influenced by his anger, he drags the body of Hector behind his chariot round the walls of Troy three times, and refuses to allow it to receive [[funeral rites]].  Much to the dismay of Achilles, the body of Hector miraculously heals and will not decay as normally expected. [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love who sided with Troy throughout the whole conflict, put a protective barrier over [[Hector]], which kept him looking like he did before he was viciously killed by Achilles. When [[Priam]], the king of Troy and Hector's father, comes secretly into the Greek camp to plead for the body, Achilles finally relents; in one of the most moving scenes of the ''Iliad'', he receives Priam graciously and allows him to take the body away.  The scene is intensely moving because [[Priam]], the king of one of the greatest cities in the known world, kneels down, old and frail as he is, and kisses the hands of the man who killed his son.

The greatness of Achilles lies in not just being the greatest Greek fighter ever, but in knowing the choice provided to him by [[Destiny]]. His mother Thetis had prophesied to him that if he pulled out of the [[Trojan War]], he would enjoy a long and a happy life. If Achilles fought, however, he would die before the walls of [[Troy]] but assure an everlasting glory, surpassing that of all other heroes. He had made the choice, and coming face to face with it showed his greatness.

====Xanthos====
During the [[Trojan War]], [[Balius and Xanthos|Xanthos]], one of Achilles' horses, was rebuked by Achilles for allowing [[Patroclus]] to be killed. Xanthos responded by saying (Hera temporarily gave him voice to do so) that a god and a mortal had killed Patroclus and a god and a mortal would soon kill Achilles  too.

====Memnon, Cycnus, Penthesilea, and the death of Achilles====
[[Image:TBanksThetis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Thetis rising from the sea to comfort Achilles'' (Book 18), by [[Thomas Banks]], English, [[1778]] [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Shortly after the death of [[Hector]], Achilles defeated [[Memnon]] of [[Ethiopia]], [[Cycnus]] of [[Colonae]] and the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior [[Penthesilia]] (with whom Achilles also had an affair in some versions). As predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] &amp;mdash; either by an arrow to the heel (which may have subsequently become fatally infected, and is said to have been guided by [[Apollo]]), or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting [[Polyxena]], a princess of Troy. Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor, and Achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield (Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles). His bones are mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games are held. Like Ajax, he is represented (although not by [[Homer]]) as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the [[Danube]].

====The fate of Achilles' armor====
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax the Greater]] (Achilles' older cousin). They competed for it and Odysseus won. Ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades; he started killing cattle (thinking they were Greek soldiers), and then himself.

==Other stories about Achilles==	 
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].  There, Achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among Lycomedes' daughters under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamea|Deidamia]], Achilles fathered a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learned from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  He went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry, but placed a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Trojan campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.  The story about Achilles in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] is not found in Homer.

In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', there is a passage in which Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave than be dead. This has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life, but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted.

The kings of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epiran princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]].

The [[homosexual]] [[Achilles and Patroclus|relationship between Achilles and Patroclus]] is something much explored in post-[[Homeric]] literature.  By the fifth and fourth centuries, the deep ‚Äî and arguably ambiguous ‚Äî friendship portrayed in Homer blossomed into an unequivocal love affair in the works of [[Aeschylus]], [[Plato]], and [[Aeschines]], and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in [[Lycophron]]'s third century ''Alexandra'' that claim Achilles slayed Troilus in a matter of unrequited love.

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (mythology)|Helene]].

Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades - as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' [[Argonautica]].

==Achilles in lost plays==
In the early [[1990]]s a lost play by [[Aeschylus]] was discovered in the wrappings of a [[mummy]] in [[Egypt]]. The play, ''[[Achilles (play)|Achilles]]'', was part of a [[trilogy]] about the [[Trojan War]]. It was known to exist due to mentions in ancient sources, but had been lost for over 2,000 years.  Another lost play by Aeschylus, ''The Myrmidons'', focussed on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus; only a few lines survive today.

There is another lost play with Achilles as the main character, ''The Lovers of Achilles'', by [[Sophocles]].

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ([[February 12]], [[1809]] ‚Äì [[April 15]], [[1865]]), sometimes called '''Abe Lincoln''' and nicknamed '''Honest Abe''', the '''Rail Splitter''', and the '''Great Emancipator''', was the 16th [[President of the United States]] (1861 to 1865), and the first president from the [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Lincoln opposed the expansion of slavery and oversaw the Union war effort during the [[American Civil War]]. He selected the generals and approved their strategy; selected senior civilian officials; supervised diplomacy, patronage and party affairs; rallied public opinion through messages and speeches such as the [[Gettysburg Address]]; and took personal charge of plans for the [[Emancipation Proclamation|abolition of slavery]] and the [[Reconstruction]] of the Union. He was assassinated as the war ended by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. 

==Role in history==
President Lincoln was opposed to what he saw as the [[Slave Power]] and staunchly opposed its efforts to expand [[history of slavery in the United States|slavery]] into federal territories. His victory in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]] further polarized an already divided nation. Before his inauguration in March of 1861, seven [[Southern United States|Southern]] states [[secession|seceded]] from the [[United States]], formed the [[Confederate States of America]], and took control of U.S. forts and other properties within their boundaries. These events soon led to the [[American Civil War]].

Lincoln is often praised for his work as a wartime leader who proved adept at balancing competing considerations and at getting rival groups to work together toward a common goal. Lincoln had to negotiate between [[Radical Republican|Radical]] and Moderate Republican leaders, who were often far apart on the issues, while attempting to win support from [[War Democrats]] and loyalists in the seceding states. He personally directed the war effort, in close cooperation (1864-65) with General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] which ultimately led the Union forces to victory over the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. 

His leadership qualities were evident in his diplomatic handling of the border slave states at the beginning of the fighting, in his defeat of a congressional attempt to reorganize his cabinet in 1862, in his many speeches and writings which helped mobilize and inspire the North, and in his defusing of the peace issue in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential campaign]]. [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] vehemently criticized him for violating the Constitution, overstepping the bounds of executive power, refusing to compromise on slavery, declaring [[martial law]], suspending [[habeas corpus]], ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and a number of newspaper publishers, and killing hundreds of thousands of young men. [[Radical Republicans]] criticized him for going too slow on abolition of slavery, and not being ruthless enough toward the conquered South.

Lincoln is most famous for his roles in preserving the Union and ending [[slavery]] in the United States with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  However, some abolitionists criticized him for only freeing the slaves under the Confederacy in 1863, and waiting until 1865 to free slaves held in the Union. 

Historians have argued that Lincoln had a lasting influence on U.S. political and social institutions, importantly setting a precedent for greater centralization of powers in the federal government and the weakening of the powers of the individual [[state government]]s. 

Lincoln spent most of his attention on military matters and politics but with his strong support his administration established the current system of [[national bank]]s with the [[National Bank Act]]. He increased the [[Morrill tariff|tariff]] to raise revenue and encourage factories, imposed the first [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]], issued hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds and Greenbacks, encouraged immigration from Europe, built the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]], set up the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], encouraged farm ownership with the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862, and set up the modern system of state universities with the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].  During the war his Treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South--the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy. During his administration [[West Virginia]] and [[Nevada]] were admitted as states.

Lincoln is usually [[historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|ranked as one of the greatest presidents]]. Because of his roles in destroying slavery, redefining national values, and saving the Union, his [[assassination]] made him a [[martyr]] to millions of Americans.  However, others considered him an unconstitutional tyrant for declaring martial law, suspending civil liberties, habeas corpus, and the First Amendment, and ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and newspaper publishers.

==Early life==
Abraham Lincoln was born on [[February 12]], [[1809]], in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the 348 acre (1.4 km&amp;sup2;) Sinking Spring Farm in the Southeast part of [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], then considered the [[frontier]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue Co.]], in Nolin Creek, three miles (5 km) south of  [[Hodgenville, Kentucky|Hodgenville]]), to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Hanks]]. Lincoln was named after his deceased grandfather, who was [[scalping|scalped]] in 1786 in an Indian raid. He had no middle name. Lincoln's parents were uneducated, illiterate farmers. When Lincoln became famous, reporters and storytellers often exaggerated the poverty and obscurity of his birth. However Lincoln's father Thomas was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site|Sinking Spring Farm]] in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. His parents belonged to a Baptist church that had pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support slavery.  From a very young age, Lincoln was exposed to anti-slavery sentiment.  However he never joined his parents' church, or any other church, and as a youth ridiculed religion.  

Three years after purchasing the property, a prior land claim filed in Hardin Circuit Court forced the Lincolns to move. Thomas continued legal action until he lost the case in 1815. Legal expenses contributed to family difficulties. In 1811, they were able to lease 30 acres (0.1 km&amp;sup2;) of a 230 acre (0.9 km&amp;sup2;) farm on Knob Creek a few miles away, where they then moved. In a valley of the [[Rolling Fork River]], this was some of the best farmland in the area. At this time, Lincoln's father was a respected community member and a successful farmer and carpenter. Lincoln's earliest recollections are from this farm.  In 1815, another claimant sought to eject the family from the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site|Knob Creek farm]].  Frustrated with litigation and lack of security provided by Kentucky courts, Thomas decided to move to [[Indiana]], which had been surveyed by the federal government, making land titles more secure.  It is possible that these episodes motivated Abraham to later learn surveying and become an attorney.  

In 1816, when Lincoln was seven years old, he and his parents moved to [[Spencer County, Indiana]], he would state &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; and partly because of economic difficulties in Kentucky. In 1818, Lincoln's mother died of &quot;[[milk sickness]]&quot; at age thirty four, when Abe was nine.  Soon afterwards, Lincoln's father remarried to Sarah Bush Johnston.  Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children.  Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying &quot;Both were good boys, but I must say ‚Äî both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.&quot; (''Lincoln'', by David Herbert Donald, 1995)

In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on government land on a site selected by Lincoln's father in [[Macon County, Illinois]]. The following winter was especially brutal, and the family nearly moved back to Indiana. When his father relocated the family to a nearby site the following year, the 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, [[canoe]]ing down the Sangamon to [[Sangamon County, Illinois]] (now in [[Menard County, Illinois|Menard County]]), in the village of [[New Salem (Menard County), Illinois|New Salem]]. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] via [[flatboat]] on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[river]]s. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction that left an indelible impression on him for the rest of his life. Whether he actually witnessed a slave auction at that time or not, living in a country with a considerable slave presence, he probably saw similar atrocities from time to time.

His formal education consisted of perhaps 18 months of schooling from itinerant teachers. In effect he was self-educated, studying every book he could borrow.  He mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, English history and American history, and developed a plain style that puzzled audiences more used to orotund oratory.  He avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food and, though unusually tall and strong, spent so much time reading that some neighbors thought he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor. He was skilled with an axe‚Äîthey called him the &quot;rail splitter&quot;‚Äîand a good wrestler.

==Early career==
Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at the age of 23 with a campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]] as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]] in the hopes of attracting [[steamboat]] traffic to the river, which would allow sparsely populated, poor areas along and near the river to grow and prosper. He served as a captain in a company of the [[Illinois]] [[militia]] drawn from New Salem during the [[Black Hawk War]], although he never saw combat.  He wrote after being elected by his peers that he had not had &quot;any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.&quot;

He later tried and failed at several small-time business ventures. He held an Illinois state [[liquor]] license and sold whiskey.  Finally, after coming across the second volume of [[Sir William Blackstone]]'s four-volume ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', he taught himself the [[law]], and was admitted to the [[Illinois State Bar Association|Illinois Bar]] in 1837. That same year, he moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]] and began to practice law with [[Stephen T. Logan]]. He became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in the prairie state, and grew steadily more prosperous. Lincoln served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], as a representative from [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]], beginning in 1834.  He became a leader of the Whig party in the legislature.  In 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot; [http://www.hti.umich.edu/l/lincoln/]

Lincoln shared a bed with [[Joshua Fry Speed]] from 1837 to 1841 in Springfield. While many historians claim it was not uncommon in the mid-19th century for men to share a bed (just as two men today may share a house or an apartment), gay activist [[C. A. Tripp]] generated controversy with his 2005 book ''[[The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln]]'', which suggested their relationship may also have been sexual.  

In 1841, Lincoln entered law practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], a fellow Whig. In 1856, both men joined the fledgling [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Following Lincoln's assassination, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln from those who knew him in central Illinois, eventually publishing a book, ''Herndon's Lincoln''.  Lincoln never joined an antislavery society and denied he supported the abolitionists.  He married into a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky, and allowed his children to spend time there surrounded by slaves. Several of his in-laws became Confederate officers.  He greatly admired the science that flourished in New England, and was perhaps the only father in Illinois at the time to send his son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], to elite eastern schools, [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].

==Marriage==
On [[November 4]], [[1842]], at the age of 33, Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]]. The couple had four sons.
*[[Robert Todd Lincoln]]: b. [[August 1]], [[1843]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[July 26]], [[1926]], in [[Manchester, Vermont]].
*[[Edward Baker Lincoln]]: b. [[March 10]], [[1846]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[February 1]], [[1850]], in Springfield, Illinois. 
*[[William Wallace Lincoln]]: b. [[December 21]], [[1850]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[February 20]], [[1862]], in Washington, D.C.
*[[Thomas (Tad) Lincoln]]: b. [[April 4]], [[1853]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[July 16]], [[1871]], in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

Only Robert survived into adulthood. Of Robert's three children, only [[Jessie Harlan Lincoln|Jessie Lincoln]] had any children (two: Mary Lincoln Beckwith and Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith). Neither Robert Beckwith nor Mary Beckwith had any children, so Abraham Lincoln's bloodline ended when Robert Beckwith (Lincoln's great-grandson) died on [[December 24]], [[1985]].

==Illinois politics==
[[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|Lincoln in 1846 or 1847]]
In 1846, Lincoln was elected to one term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. A staunch Whig, Lincoln often referred to party leader [[Henry Clay]] as his political idol. As a freshman House member, Lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in Congress. He used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the [[Mexican-American War|war]] with [[Mexico]], which he attributed to [[James Knox Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory ‚Äî that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;

Lincoln was a key early supporter of [[Zachary Taylor]]'s candidacy for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1848|1848 '''Whig Presidential nomination]]. When Lincoln's term ended, the incoming Taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote [[Oregon Territory]]. Acceptance would end his career in the fast-growing state of Illinois, so he declined. Returning instead to [[Springfield, Illinois]] he turned''' most of his energies to making a living at the [[bar (law)|bar]], which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county.

==Prairie lawyer==
By the mid-1850s, Lincoln faced competing transportation interests ‚Äî both the river [[barge]]s and the [[railroad]]s. In 1849, he received a patent related to buoying vessels. Lincoln represented the [[Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in an 1851 dispute with one of its shareholders, [[James A. Barret]]. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer proposed Alton &amp; Sangamon route was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue Mr. Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.

Another important example of Lincoln's skills as a railroad lawyer was a lawsuit over a tax exemption that the state granted to the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]. [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]] argued that the state had no authority to grant such an exemption, and it sought to impose taxes on the railroad notwithstanding. In January 1856, the Illinois Supreme Court delivered its opinion upholding the tax exemption, accepting Lincoln's arguments.

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of [[James Preston Metzker]]. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]], a rare tactic at that time, to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand, claiming he witnessed the crime in the moonlight. Lincoln produced a [[Farmer's Almanac]] to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based upon this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.

==Republican politics 1854-1860==
The [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854, which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's spread that had been part of the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, drew Lincoln back into politics.

Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, incorporating it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people of a territory should decide whether to allow slavery or not, and not have a decision imposed on them by Congress.

It was a speech against Kansas-Nebraska, on [[October 16]], [[1854]] in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], that caused Lincoln to stand out among the other [[free soil]] orators of the day. He helped form the new Republican party, drawing on remnants of the old Whig, [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], Liberty and Democratic parties.  
In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854, and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep party unity he allowed the election to go to his colleague [[Lyman Trumbull]].

In 1857-58 Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a terrific fight for control of the Democratic party.  Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he led the opposition to the administration's push for the [[Lecompton Constitution]] which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].  Accepting the Republican nomination for the Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered a famous speech [http://www.nationalcenter.org/HouseDivided.html] in which he stated, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved ‚Äî I do not expect the house to fall ‚Äî but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot; The speech created a lasting image of the danger of disunion due to slavery, and rallied Republicans across the north.

The 1858 campaign featured the [[Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858|Lincoln-Douglas debates]], a nationally noticed discussion on the issues that threatened to split the nation in two. Lincoln forced Douglas to propose his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which lost him further support among slave-holders and speeded the division of the Democratic Party. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.

During the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when racial egalitarianism was considered politically incorrect, Stephen Douglas would inform the crowds, ‚ÄúIf you desire negro citizenship‚Ä¶if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves‚Ä¶ then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.‚Äù [http://www.nps.gov/liho/debate1.htm (Official Records of Debate)] On the defensive Lincoln countered that he was ‚Äúnot in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.‚Äù  [http://www.nps.gov/liho/debate4.htm (Official Records of Debate)] Historians generally remained mixed on what Lincoln‚Äôs actual views were on race.  However, many tend to doubt that the highly political nature of these debates offer reliable evidence about his personal views. (Team of Rivals, by Doris Kearns Goodwin, 2005) (Lincoln: In Text and Context, by Donald Fehrenbacher, 1987) As Fredrick Douglass observed, ‚Äú[Lincoln was] the first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.‚Äù (Life and Times of Fredrick Douglass, by Fredrick Douglass, 1895)

Lincoln's opposition to slavery was opposition to the [[Slave Power]], and he was not an abolitionist in 1858. But the Civil War changed everything, and changed Lincoln's beliefs in race relations as well.

==Election of 1860==
[[Image:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;, political cartoon, 1860]]
Entering the  presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than rivals [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon Chase]]. His &quot;western&quot; origins also appealed to the newer states. Other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party, specifically Seward, who had run afoul of newspaperman [[Horace Greeley]]. During the campaign, Lincoln was dubbed &quot;The Rail Splitter&quot; by Republicans to emphasize the power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. 

On [[November 6]], [[1860]], Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Douglas, [[John C. Breckenridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John C. Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]].  Lincoln was the first Republican president. He won entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South ‚Äî and won only 2 of 996 counties there. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total,) for 180 electoral votes, Douglas 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes, Breckenridge 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes, and Bell 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes.  There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln  had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes, and would still have won the electoral college and the election.

==Secession winter 1860-61==
As Lincoln's election became more and more probable, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead followed by six other [[cotton]]-growing states: Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though warning Lincoln they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves an entirely new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. President Buchanan and president-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.

President-elect Lincoln survived an [[assassination]] threat in Baltimore, and on [[February 23]], [[1861]] arrived in disguise in Washington. At Lincoln's inauguration on [[March 4]], [[1861]], the [[Turners]] formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion or insurrection from Confederates in the capital city. 

[[Image:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Photograph showing [[March 4]], [[1861]] inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of U.S. Capitol]]
In his [[Lincoln's First Inaugural|First Inaugural]] Address, Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments&quot;, arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, and thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it? 

Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to unite the Union and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the proposed [[Corwin amendment|Corwin Amendment]] to the constitution, of which he had been a driving force. It would have explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, and had already passed both houses. Lincoln adamantly opposed the [[Crittenden Compromise]], however, which would have permitted slavery in the territories, renewing the boundary set by the [[Missouri Compromise]] and extending it to [[California]]. Despite support for this compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln declared that were the Crittenden Compromise accepted, it &quot;would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and [[Tierra del Fuego]].&quot; 

Because opposition to slavery expansion was the key issue uniting the Republican Party at the time, Lincoln is sometimes criticized for putting politics ahead of the national interest in refusing any compromise allowing the expansion of slavery. Supporters of Lincoln, however, point out that he did not oppose slavery because he was a Republican, but became a Republican because of his opposition to the expansion of slavery, that he opposed several other Republicans who were in favor of compromise, and that he clearly thought his course of action was in the national interest.  By the time Lincoln took office the Confederacy was an established fact and not a single leader of that country ever proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because no compromise was possible.  Lincoln perhaps could have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession.  Lincoln, and nearly all Republican leaders, adopted this nationalistic position by March, 1861: the Union could not be broken.

==War begins: 1861-1862==
{{main|American Civil War}}
After Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired on and forced to surrender in April, Lincoln called on governors of every state to send 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.  Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, then seceded, along with North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas. 

The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery in loyal states.

==Emancipation Proclamation==
[[Image:Emancipation_proclamation.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Lincoln met with his Cabinet for the first reading of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] draft on [[July 22]], [[1862]].]]
{{main articles|[[Abraham Lincoln on slavery]] and [[Emancipation Proclamation]]}} 
Congress in July 1862 moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. It provided:
:That if any person shall hereafter incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to, any such existing rebellion or insurrection, and be convicted thereof, such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and by the liberation of all his slaves, if any he have; or by both of said punishments, at the discretion of the court.
:....
:SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the United States; and all slaves of such person found on [or] being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.

Thus everyone who 60 days after [[July 17]], [[1862]] supported the rebellion was to be punished by having all their slaves freed. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. This did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the XIII Amendment did that), but it shows Lincoln had the support of (and was even somewhat pushed by) Congress in liberating the slaves owned by rebels.  Lincoln implemented the new law by his &quot;Emancipation Proclamation.&quot; 

Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States and he personally opposed slavery as a profound moral evil not in accord with the principle of equality asserted in the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]]. Yet, Lincoln's views of the role of the federal government on the subject of slavery are more complicated. Before the Confederate states seceded, Lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery into the [[Historic regions of the United States|territories]], where Congress did have authority. However, he maintained that the federal government could not constitutionally bar slavery in states where it already existed. During his presidency, Lincoln made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves was a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Lincoln was criticized both at home and abroad for his refusal to take a stand for the complete abolition of slavery. On [[August 22]], [[1862]], a few weeks before signing the Proclamation, and after it had already been drafted, Lincoln responded by letter to an editorial by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' which had urged abolition: 
:I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be &quot;the Union as it was.&quot; If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.
:I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm]

With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued in two parts on [[September 22]], [[1862]] and [[January 1]], [[1863]], Lincoln made the abolition of slavery a goal of the war. Lincoln addresses the issue of his consistency (or lack thereof) between his earlier position and his later position on emancipation in an 1864 letter to [[Albert G. Hodges]][http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm] 

Lincoln is often credited with freeing enslaved [[African Americans]] with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. However, border states that still allowed slavery but were under Union control were exempt from the emancipation because they were not covered under any war measures. The proclamation on its first day, [[January 1]], [[1863]], freed only a few escaped slaves, but as Union armies advanced south more and more slaves were liberated until hundreds of thousands were freed (exactly how many is unknown).  Lincoln signed the Proclamation as a wartime measure, insisting that only the outbreak of war gave constitutional power to the President to free slaves in states where it already existed.  He later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made abolishing slavery in the rebel states an official war goal and it became the impetus for the enactment of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] which abolished slavery; Lincoln was one of the main promoters of that amendment. 

Although some Northern conservatives recoiled at the notion that the war was now being fought for the slaves instead of for preserving the Union, in the end the Emancipation Proclamation  did much to help the Northern cause politically. Lincoln's strong [[abolitionist]] stand finally convinced the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and other foreign countries that they could not support the [[Confederate States of America]].  This move remains one of the great seizures of private property by the federal government, restoring the ownership of the blacks to themselves,

Lincoln had for some time been working on plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] in Africa and South America for the nearly 4 million newly freed slaves. He remarked upon colonization favorably in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.

==Important domestic measures of Lincoln's first term==
[[Image:Lincoln.png|thumb|right|While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1861 at the suggestion of 11-year-old [[Grace Bedell]].]]

Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws. He was anti-vescovian. He signed them, vetoing only bills that threatened his war powers.  Thus he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making available millions of acres of government-held land in the west for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for [[agricultural universities]] in each state. Lincoln also signed the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864, which granted federal support to the construction of the United States' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869.  The most important legislation involved money matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs.  Most important was the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. 

Lincoln sent a senior general to put down the &quot;[[Sioux Uprising |Sioux Uprising]]&quot; of August 1862 in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted [[Santee Dakota]] who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).

==1864 election and second inauguration==
After Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] in 1863, many in the North believed that victory was soon to come after Lincoln appointed [[Ulysses S. Grant|U.S. Grant]] General-in-Chief on [[March 12]], [[1864]].  Although no president since [[Andrew Jackson]] had been elected to a second term (and none since [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren]] had been re-nominated), Lincoln's re-election was considered a certainty.

However, when the spring campaigns, east and west, all turned into bloody stalemates, Northern morale dipped and Lincoln seemed less likely to be re-nominated.  [[U.S. Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] strongly desired the Republican nomination and was working hard to win it, while [[John Fremont]] was nominated by a breakoff group of radical Republicans, potentially taking away crucial votes in the November elections.

Fearing he might lose the election, Lincoln wrote out and signed the following pledge, but did not show it to his cabinet, asking them each to sign the sealed envelope. Lincoln wrote:

:This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected.  Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards.

The Democrats, hoping to make setbacks in the war a top campaign issue, waited until late summer to nominate a candidate.  Their platform was heavily influenced by the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party, calling the war a &quot;failure,&quot; but their candidate, former General [[George McClellan]], was a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]], determined to prosecute the war until the Union was restored, although willing to compromise on all other issues, including slavery.

McClellan's candidacy was soon undercut as on [[September 1]], just two days after the [[1864 Democratic National Convention|convention]], [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]] was abandoned by the Confederate army.  Coming on the heels of [[David Farragut|David Farragut's]] capture of [[Battle of Mobile Bay|Mobile Bay]] and followed by [[Phil Sheridan|Phil Sheridan's]] crushing victory over [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early's]] army at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]], it was now apparent that the tide had turned in favor of the Union and that Lincoln may be reelected despite the costs of the war.

Still, Lincoln believed that he would win the [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral vote]] by only a slim margin, failing to give him the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] he'd need if he was to push his lenient [[reconstruction]] plan.  To his surprise, Lincoln ended up winning all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.

After Lincoln's election, on [[March 4]], [[1865]], he delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], which was his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was within sight, [[slavery]] had effectively ended, and Lincoln was looking to the future.

:Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;
:With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

==Civil War and reconstruction==
===Conducting the war effort===
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and it occupied nearly all of his time. Lincoln had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Lincoln wished to take an active part in planning the war strategy despite his inexperience in military affairs. Lincoln's strategic priorities were two-fold: first, to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well-defended; and second, to conduct an aggressive war effort in hopes of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press, who pushed for an offensive war. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to military service, took a more cautious approach. McClellan took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], which involved capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did McClellan's insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of his Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''[[Harrison's Landing Letter]]'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint fellow Republican [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire for the Union to move towards Richmond from the north, thus guarding Washington, D.C. However, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] during the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back into the defenses of Washington for a second time. Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]]. 

Panicked by Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of [[Maryland]], Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862. It was the Union victory in that battle that allowed Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln relieved McClellan of command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac, who promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for an aggressive offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given command, despite his idle talk about becoming a military strong man. Hooker was routed by Lee at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May 1863 and also relieved of command.

After the Union victory at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[George G. Meade | Meade's]] failure to pursue Lee, and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac, Lincoln decided to bring in a western general: General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Chattanooga]]. Earlier, reacting to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, &quot;I cannot spare this man. He fights.&quot; Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864, using a strategy of a [[war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher losses in the Confederate army. Grant's aggressive campaign would eventually bottle up Lee in the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and result in the Union taking Richmond and bringing the war to a close in the spring of 1865. 

Lincoln authorized Grant to use a [[scorched earth]] approach to destroy the South's morale and economic ability to continue the war. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy farms and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. The damage in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million.

Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the [[Mississippi River]] and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. However, he had little success in his efforts to motivate his generals to adopt his strategies. Eventually, he found in Grant a man who shared his vision of the war and was able to bring that vision to reality with his relentless pursuit of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters of war. 

Lincoln, perhaps reflecting his lack of military experience, developed a keen curiosity with military campaigning during the war. He spent hours at the [[United States War Department|War Department]] [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] office, reading dispatches from his generals through many a night. He frequently visited battle sites and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During [[Jubal A. Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid into Washington, D.C.]], in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck his head to avoid being shot while observing the scenes of battle.

===Homefront===
Lincoln was more successful in giving the war meaning to Northern civilians through his oratorical skills. Despite his meager education and &amp;#8220;backwoods&amp;#8221; upbringing, Lincoln possessed an extraordinary command of the English language, as evidenced by the [[Gettysburg Address]], a speech dedicating a cemetery of Union soldiers from the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] that he delivered on November 19, 1863. While the featured speaker, orator [[Edward Everett]], spoke for two hours, Lincoln's few choice words resonated across the nation and across history, defying Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; Lincoln's [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than any of his contemporaries the rationale behind the Union effort.

During the Civil War, Lincoln exercised powers no previous president had wielded; he proclaimed a [[blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money without [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] authorization, and imprisoned thousands of accused Confederate sympathizers without trial. There is a fragment of uncorraborated evidence that Lincoln made contingency plans to arrest [[Chief Justice]] [[Roger Brooke Taney]], though the allegation remains unresolved and controversial (see the [[Taney Arrest Warrant]] controversy). 

The long war and the issue of emancipation appeared to be severely hampering his prospects and pessimists warned that defeat appeared likely.  Lincoln ran under the Union party banner, composed of War Democrats and Republicans. General Grant was facing severe criticism for his conduct of the bloody [[Overland Campaign]] that summer and the seemingly endless [[Siege of Petersburg]]. However, the Union capture of the key railroad center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] by Sherman's forces in September changed the situation dramatically and Lincoln was reelected.

===Reconstruction===
The [[reconstruction]] of the Union weighed heavy on the President's mind throughout the war effort. He was determined to take a course that would not permanently alienate the former Confederate states, and throughout the war Lincoln urged speedy elections under generous terms in areas behind Union lines. This irritated congressional Republicans, who urged a more stringent Reconstruction policy. One of Lincoln's few vetoes during his term was of the [[Wade-Davis Bil]]l, an effort by congressional Republicans to impose harsher Reconstruction terms on the Confederate areas. Republicans in Congress retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] during the war under Lincoln's generous terms.

&quot;Let 'em up easy,&quot; he told his assembled military leaders [[Ulysses S. Grant|Gen. Ulysses S. Grant]] (a future president), [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Gen. William T. Sherman]] and [[David Dixon Porter|Adm. David Dixon Porter]] in an 1865 meeting on the steamer ''River Queen''. When [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], the Confederate capital, was at long last captured, Lincoln went there to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis]]'s own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot;

On [[April 9]], [[1865]], Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]] in [[Virginia]]. This left only [[Joseph Johnston]]'s forces in the East to deal with. Weeks later Johnston would defy Jefferson Davis and surrender his forces to Sherman. Of course, Lincoln would not survive to see the surrender of all Confederate forces; just five days after Lee surrendered, Lincoln was [[assassination|assassinated]]. He was the first President to be assassinated, and the third to die in office.

==Assassination==
[[Image:Lincolnassassination.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Lincoln, and Booth.]]

Lincoln had met frequently with Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as the war drew to a close. The two men planned matters of reconstruction, and it was evident to all that they held each other in high regard. During their last meeting, on [[April 14]], [[1865]] ([[Good Friday]]), Lincoln invited Grant to a social engagement that evening. Grant declined (Grant's wife, [[Julia Dent Grant]], is said to have strongly disliked [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]). The President's eldest son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], also turned down the invitation. 

[[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and Southern sympathizer from [[Maryland]], heard that the president and Mrs. Lincoln, along with the Grants, would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]]. Having failed in a plot to kidnap Lincoln earlier, Booth informed his co-conspirators of his intention to kill Lincoln.  Others were assigned to assassinate [[Vice-President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[William Seward]].

Without his [[bodyguard]] [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous [[dream]] of his own assassination, the Lincolns left to attend the play at Ford's Theater. The play, ''[[Our American Cousin]]'', was a musical comedy by the British writer [[Tom Taylor]]. As Lincoln sat in his state box in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President's box and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would cover the gunshot noise. On stage, actor Harry Hawk said the last words Lincoln would ever hear &quot;Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal‚Äîyou sockdologizing old man-trap...&quot;. When the laughter came Booth jumped into the box the president was in and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 [[caliber]] [[Deringer]] at his head, firing at point-blank range.  The bullet entered behind Lincoln's left ear and lodged behind his right eyeball. Major [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present in the Presidential Box, momentarily grappled with Booth but was severely stabbed and slashed by the assassin. It was believed that Booth then shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; (Latin: &quot;Thus always to tyrants,&quot; the state motto of Virginia; some accounts say he added &quot;The South is avenged!&quot;) and jumped from the balcony to the stage below, breaking his leg. Despite his injury, Booth managed to limp to his horse and make his escape.

As Booth fled from the theater, a young physician, Dr. [[Charles Leale]], made his way through the audience to Lincoln's box. Leale quickly assessed the wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he expired. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches inside his brain. Lincoln, who never regained consciousness, was officially pronounced dead at 7:22 A.M. the next morning, April 15, 1865. Upon his death, Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] lamented &quot;now he belongs to the ages.&quot; After Lincoln's body was returned to the [[White House]], his body was prepared for his &quot;lying in state&quot; in the [[East Room]]. 

The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection since the time of Lincoln's death, several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display in the museum are the bullet that was fired from the Deringer pistol, ending Lincoln's life, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of his skull and hair and the surgeon's cuff, stained with Lincoln's blood. The museum can be found at [http://www.nmhm.washingtondc.museum/exhibits/nationswounds/lincoln.html www.hmhm.washingtondc.museum]

[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|right|thumbnail|250px|Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles to Illinois.]]
Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois. The nation mourned a man whom many viewed as the savior of the United States. He was buried in [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]] in Springfield, where a 177 foot (54 m) tall granite tomb surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln was constructed by 1874. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick on [[September 26]], [[1901]].

==Presidential appointments==
===Administration and Cabinet===
Lincoln was known for appointing his enemies and political rivals to high positions in his Cabinet. Not only did he use great political skill in reducing potential political opposition, but he felt he was appointing the best qualified person for the good of the country.

==Legacy and memorials==
Lincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Today he is perhaps America's second most famous and beloved President after [[George Washington]]. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]]. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as a figure who personifies [[Image:Lincoln_statue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|[[Daniel Chester French]]'s seated ''Lincoln'' faces the [[National Mall]] to the east.]]
[[Image:MtRushmore Abe close.JPG|thumbnail|100px|Lincoln's bust on Mt. Rushmore.]]classical values of honesty, integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[gay rights]] group [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln Financial Group|Lincoln Financial]]. The [[Lincoln automobile]] is also named after him.

Over the years Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]; with the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (''pictured, right''); on the U.S. [[U.S. five dollar bill|$5 bill]] and the [[Penny (U.S. coin)|1 cent coin]] (Illinois is the primary opponent to the removal of the penny from circulation); and as part of the [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]]. [[Lincoln's Tomb]], [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[New Salem (Menard County), Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theater]] and Petersen House are all preserved as museums. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for [[Illinois]] is ''Land of Lincoln''. 

[[Counties of the United States|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[Lincoln County, Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.

On [[February 12]], [[1892]], Abraham Lincoln's birthday was declared to be a federal [[holiday]] in the United States, although in 1971 it was combined with Washington's birthday in the form of [[President's Day]]. February 12 is still observed as a separate legal holiday in many states, including Illinois.

Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]] and [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] is also in Springfield. The [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] is located in [[Elwood, Illinois]].

Statues of Lincoln can be found in other countries. In [[Ciudad Ju√°rez]], [[Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]], is a 13-foot high bronze statue, a gift from the United States, dedicated in 1966 by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The U.S. received a statue of [[Benito Ju√°rez]] in exchange, which is in Washington, D.C. Ju√°rez and Lincoln exchanged friendly letters, and Mexico remembers Lincoln's opposition to the [[Mexican-American War]]. There is also a statue in [[Tijuana]], Mexico, showing Lincoln standing and destroying the chains of slavery. There are at least three statues of Lincoln in the [[United Kingdom]]‚Äîone in [[London]] by [[Augustus St. Gaudens]],  one in [[Manchester]] by [[George Grey Barnard]] and another in [[Edinburgh]] by [[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]]. 

The [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (SSBN-602)]] and the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]] were named in his honor. Also, the [[Liberty ship]], [[SS Nancy Hanks|SS ''Nancy Hanks'']] was named to honor his mother.

In a recent public vote entitled &quot;[[The Greatest American]],&quot; Lincoln placed second (placing first was [[Ronald Reagan]]).

==Trivia==
* Lincoln stood 6'3 3/4&quot; (192.4 cm) tall and thus was the tallest president in U.S. history, just edging out [[Lyndon Johnson]] at 6'3 1/2&quot; (191.8 cm).
* He was born on the same day as [[Charles Darwin]].
* The last surviving self-described witness to Lincoln's assassination was [[Samuel J. Seymour]] (~1860‚Äì[[April 14]], [[1956]]), who appeared two months before his death at age 96 on the [[CBS]]-TV [[quiz show]] ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He said that as a five-year-old he had thought at first that he, himself, had been shot because his nurse, trying to fix a torn place in his blouse, stuck him with a pin at the moment of the gun's discharge.
* According to legend, Lincoln was referred to as &quot;two-faced&quot; by his opponent in the 1858 [[Senate]] election, [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]]. Upon hearing about this Lincoln jokingly replied, &quot;If I had another face to wear, do you really think I would be wearing this one?&quot;
* According to legend, Lincoln also said, as a young man, on his appearance one day when looking in the mirror: &quot;It's a fact, Abe! You are the ugliest man in the world. If ever I see a man uglier than you, I'm going to shoot him on the spot!&quot; It would no doubt, he thought, be an act of mercy.
* Based on written descriptions of Lincoln, including the observations that he was much taller than most men of his day and had long limbs, an abnormally-shaped chest, and loose or lax joints, it has been conjectured since the 1960s that Lincoln may have suffered from [[Marfan syndrome]].
*Lincoln was known to have a case of [[depression]]. During his time in New Salem, Illinois, his fiancee died, and that triggered his depression. His close friends watched over him to make sure he did not commit suicide. He also suffered from nightmares during his term in the [[White House]]. His depression got so severe, he had to hold a cabinet meeting from his bed.
*He once mentioned one of his haunting nightmares to his friend. Lincoln mentioned that he was standing in a mourning crowd surrounding a train, and when he asked a grieving woman what had happened, she replied, &quot;The President has been shot, and he has died.&quot;
*Lincoln is the only American president to hold a [[patent]].  The patent is for a device that lifts [[boat|boats]] over [[shoal|shoals]].

'''Aristotle''' ({{lang-grc|{{{polytonic|ŒëœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÑŒ≠ŒªŒ∑œÇ}}}}} Aristotelƒìs [[384 BC]] &amp;ndash; [[March 7]], [[322 BC]]) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]], who studied with [[Plato]] and taught [[Alexander the Great]]. He wrote books on many subjects, including [[physics]], [[poetry]], [[zoology]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[government]], and [[biology]].

Aristotle, along with Plato and [[Socrates]], is generally considered one of the most influential of [[Ancient philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. They transformed [[Presocratic]] [[Greek philosophy]] into the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] as we know it. The writings of Plato and Aristotle founded two of the most important schools of [[Ancient philosophy]].

Aristotle valued knowledge gained from the senses and in modern terms would be classed among the  modern [[empiricist]]s (see [[materialism]] and [[empiricism]]).  He also achieved a &quot;grounding&quot; of dialectic in the Topics by allowing interlocutors to begin from commonly held beliefs (''[[Endoxa]]''); his goal being non-contradiction rather than [[Truth]]. He set the stage for what would eventually develop into the empiricist version of [[scientific method]] centuries later. Although he wrote dialogues early in his career, no more than fragments of these have survived. The works of Aristotle that still exist today are in [[treatise]] form and were, for the most part, unpublished texts. These were probably lecture notes or texts used by his students, and were almost certainly revised repeatedly over the course of years. As a result, these works tend to be eclectic, dense and difficult to read. Among the most important ones are ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics]] (or [[Ontology]])'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics]]''.
These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, are very different in both style and substance. 

Aristotle is known for being one of the few figures in history who studied almost every subject possible at the time. In science, Aristotle studied [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], [[economics]], [[embryology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], [[physics]], and [[zoology]]. In philosophy, Aristotle wrote on [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[government]], [[metaphysics]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]] and [[theology]]. He also dealt with [[education]], foreign customs, [[literature]] and [[poetry]]. His combined works practically constitute an [[encyclopedia]] of Greek knowledge.

== Biography ==
===Early life and studies at the Academy===
[[Image:Bust of Aristotle.jpg|thumb|A [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Aristotle is a nearly ubiquitous ornament in places of high culture in the [[Western world|West]].]]

Aristotle was born at [[Stageira]], a [[apoikia|colony]] of [[Andros]] on the [[Macedon]]ian peninsula of [[Chalcidice]] in [[384 BC]]. His father, Nicomachus, was court physician to King [[Amyntas III of Macedon]]. It is believed that Aristotle's ancestors held this position under various kings of the Macedons. As such, Aristotle's early education would probably have consisted of instruction in [[medicine]] and [[biology]] from his father. About his mother, Phaestis, little is known. It is known that she died early in Aristotle's life. When Nicomachus also died, in Aristotle's tenth year, he was left an [[orphan]] and placed under the guardianship of his uncle, [[Proxenus of Atarneus]]. He taught Aristotle [[Greek language|Greek]], [[rhetoric]], and [[poetry]] (O'Connor ''et al.'', [[2004]]). Aristotle was probably influenced by his father's medical knowledge; when he went to [[Athens]] at the age of 18, he was likely already trained in the investigation of natural phenomena.

From the age of 18 to 37 Aristotle remained in Athens as a pupil of [[Plato]] and distinguished himself at the ''[[Academy]]''. The relations between Plato and Aristotle have formed the subject of various legends, many of which depict Aristotle unfavourably. No doubt there were divergences of opinion between Plato, who took his stand on sublime, idealistic principles, and Aristotle, who even at that time showed a preference for the investigation of the facts and laws of the physical world. It is also probable that Plato suggested that Aristotle needed restraining rather than encouragement, but not that there was an open breach of friendship. In fact, Aristotle's conduct after the death of Plato, his continued association with [[Xenocrates]] and other [[Platonists]], and his allusions in his writings to Plato's doctrines prove that while there were conflicts of opinion between Plato and Aristotle, there was no lack of cordial appreciation or mutual forbearance. Besides this, the legends that reflect Aristotle unfavourably are traceable to the [[Epicureans]], who were known as slanderers. If such legends were circulated widely by [[patristic]] writers such as [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Gregory Nazianzen]], the reason lies in the exaggerated esteem Aristotle was held in by the early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[heretic]]s, not in any well-grounded historical tradition.

===Aristotle as philosopher and tutor===
After the death of Plato ([[347 BC]]), Aristotle was considered as the next head of the Academy, a position that was eventually awarded to Plato's nephew. Aristotle then went with Xenocrates to the court of [[Hermias]], ruler of [[Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]], and married his niece and adopted daughter, Pythia. In [[344 BC]], Hermias was murdered in a rebellion, &lt;!--''(or a Persian attack?)''--&gt; and Aristotle went with his family to [[Mytilene]]. It is also reported that he stopped  on [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] and briefly conducted biological research. Then, one or two years later, he was summoned to Pella, the Macedonian capital, by King [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor of [[Alexander the Great]], who was then 13.

[[Plutarch]] wrote that Aristotle not only imparted to Alexander a knowledge of ethics and politics, but also of the most profound secrets of philosophy. We have much proof that Alexander profited by contact with the philosopher, and that Aristotle made prudent and beneficial use of his influence over the young prince (although [[Bertrand Russell]] disputes this). Due to this influence, Alexander provided Aristotle with ample means for the acquisition of books and the pursuit of his scientific investigation.

It is possible that Aristotle also participated in the education of Alexander's boyhood friends, which may have included for example [[Hephaestion]] and [[Harpalus]]. Aristotle maintained a long correspondence with Hephaestion, eventually collected into a book, unfortunately now lost.

According to sources such as Plutarch and [[Diogenes]], Philip had Aristotle's hometown of Stageira burned during the [[340s BC]], and Aristotle successfully requested that Alexander rebuild it. During his tutorship of Alexander, Aristotle was reportedly considered a second time for leadership of the Academy; his companion Xenocrates was selected instead.

===Founder and master of the Lyceum===
In about [[335 BC]], Alexander departed for his Asiatic campaign, and Aristotle, who had served as an informal adviser (more or less) since Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne, returned to Athens and opened his own school of philosophy. He may, as [[Aulus Gellius]] says, have conducted a school of [[rhetoric]] during his former residence in Athens; but now, following Plato's example, he gave regular instruction in philosophy in a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] dedicated to [[Apollo Lyceios]], from which his school has come to be known as the [[Lyceum]]. (It was also called the [[Peripatetic]] School because Aristotle preferred to discuss problems of philosophy with his pupils while walking up and down -- ''peripateo'' -- the shaded walks -- ''peripatoi'' -- around the gymnasium).

During the thirteen years ([[335 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[322 BC]]) which he spent as teacher of the Lyceum, Aristotle composed most of his writings. Imitating Plato, he wrote ''[[Dialogue]]s'' in which his doctrines were expounded in somewhat popular language. He also composed the several treatises (which will be mentioned below) on physics, metaphysics, and so forth, in which the exposition is more [[didactic]] and the language more technical than in the ''Dialogues''. These writings show to what good use he put the resources Alexander had provided for him. They show particularly how he succeeded in bringing together the works of his predecessors in Greek philosophy, and how he pursued, either personally or through others, his investigations in the realm of natural phenomena. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] claimed that Alexander placed under Aristotle's orders all the hunters, fishermen, and fowlers of the royal kingdom and all the overseers of the royal forests, lakes, ponds and cattle-ranges, and Aristotle's works on zoology make this statement more believable. Aristotle was fully informed about the doctrines of his predecessors, and [[Strabo]] asserted that he was the first to accumulate a great library.

During the last years of Aristotle's life the relations between him and Alexander became very strained, owing to the disgrace and punishment of [[Callisthenes]], whom Aristotle had recommended to Alexander. Nevertheless, Aristotle continued to be regarded at Athens as a friend of Alexander and a representative of Macedonia. Consequently, when Alexander's death became known in Athens, and the outbreak occurred which led to the [[Lamian war]], Aristotle shared in the general unpopularity of the Macedonians. The charge of [[impiety]], which had been brought against [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Socrates]], was now, with even less reason, brought against Aristotle. He left the city, saying (according to many ancient authorities) that he would not give the Athenians a chance to sin a third time against philosophy. He took up residence at his country house at [[Chalcis]], in [[Euboea]], and there he died the following year, [[322 BC]]. His death was due to a disease, reportedly 'of the stomach', from which he had long suffered. The story that his death was due to [[hemlock]] poisoning, as well as the legend that he threw himself into the sea &quot;because he could not explain the [[tide]]s,&quot; is without historical foundation.

Very little is known about Aristotle's personal appearance except from hostile sources. The statues and busts of Aristotle, possibly from the first years of the Peripatetic School, represent him as sharp and keen of countenance, and somewhat below the average height. His character&amp;mdash;as revealed by his writings, his will (which is undoubtedly genuine), fragments of his letters and the allusions of his unprejudiced contemporaries&amp;mdash;was that of a high-minded, kind-hearted man, devoted to his family and his friends, kind to his slaves, fair to his enemies and rivals, grateful towards his benefactors. When [[Platonism]] ceased to dominate the world of [[Christianity|Christian]] speculation, and the works of Aristotle began to be studied without fear and prejudice, the personality of Aristotle appeared to the Christian writers of the [[13th century]], as it had to the unprejudiced pagan writers of his own day, as calm, majestic, untroubled by passion, and undimmed by any great moral defects, &quot;the master of those who know&quot;.

Aristotle's legacy also had a profound influence on Islamic thought and philosophy during the [[Middle Ages|middle ages]]. The likes of [[Avicenna]], [[Farabi]], and Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi&lt;small&gt;[http://www.ummah.net/history/scholars/KINDI.html 1]&lt;/small&gt; were a few of the  major proponents of the Aristotelian school of thought during the ''[[Golden Age of Islam]]''.

== Methodology ==
{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
Aristotle defines philosophy in terms of [[essence]], saying that philosophy is &quot;the science of the universal essence of that which is [[actual]]&quot;. Plato had defined it as the &quot;science of the [[idea]]&quot;, meaning by idea what we should call the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]]. Both pupil and master regard philosophy as concerned with the [[universal]]; Aristotle, however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, and called it the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas. In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive.

In Aristotle's terminology, the term ''natural philosophy'' corresponds to the phenomena of the natural world, which include: [[motion]], [[light]], and the [[laws of physics]]. Many centuries later these subjects would become the basis of modern science, as studied through the [[scientific method]]. In modern times the term ''philosophy'' has come to be more narrowly understood as metaphysics, distinct from empirical study of the natural world via the physical sciences.  In contrast, in Aristotle's time and use [[philosophy]] was taken to encompass all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, he makes philosophy coextensive with [[reasoning]], which he also called &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that which is covered by the scientific method.  &quot;All science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical.&quot; By practical science he understands ethics and politics; by poetical, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; while by theoretical philosophy he means physics, mathematics, and metaphysics.

The last, philosophy in the stricter sense, he defines as &quot;the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being,&quot; and calls it &quot;first philosophy&quot;, &quot;the theologic science&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of abstraction.&quot; If logic, or, as Aristotle calls it, [[Analytic]], be regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, we have as divisions of Aristotelian philosophy (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including [[Metaphysics]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], (3) Practical Philosophy; and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

==Aristotle's epistemology==
===Logic===
{{main|Aristotelian logic}}
{{see details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}
==== History ====
Aristotle &quot;says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak about'&quot; (Boche&amp;#324;ski, [[1951]]). However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was thought of before him, by [[Prodikos of Keos]], who was concerned by the right use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers used concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' as a rule when discussing, but never understood its logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic. Although he had the idea of constructing a system for [[deduction]], he was never able to construct one. Instead, he relied on his [[dialectic]], which was a confusion between different sciences and methods (Boche&amp;#324;ski, [[1951]]). Plato thought that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, so he focused on having good premises so that the [[conclusion]] would follow. Later on, Plato realised that a method for obtaining the conclusion would be beneficial. Plato never obtained such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''Sophist'', where he introduced his division method (Rose, [[1968]]).

====Analytics and the ''Organon''====
{{main|Organon}}
What we call today Aristotelian logic, Aristotle himself would have labelled analytics. The term logic he reserved to mean dialectics. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books at about the time of [[Christ]]:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.'' (Boche&amp;#324;ski, 1951).

====Modal logic====
Aristotle is also the creator of [[syllogism]]s with modalities ([[modal logic]]). The word modal refers to the word 'modes', explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of [[truth]]. Aristotle introduced the qualification of 'necessary' and 'possible' premises. He constructed a logic which helped in the evaluation of truth but which was very difficult to interpret. (Rose, 1968).

===Science===
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|left|Aristotle, by Francesco Hayez]]
Aristotelian discussions about science had only been qualitative, not quantitative. By the modern definition of the term, Aristotelian philosophy was not science, as this [[worldview]] did not attempt to probe how the world actually worked through [[experiment]]. For example, in his book ''[[History of Animals|The history of animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. Had he only made some observations, he would have discovered that this claim is false.

Rather, based on what one's senses told one, Aristotelian philosophy then depended upon the assumption that man's mind could elucidate all the laws of the universe, based on simple observation (without experimentation) through [[reason]] alone.  

One of the reasons for this was that Aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own, whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own. In this philosophy, he could not imagine that there was a relationship between them.

In contrast, today's &quot;science&quot; assumes that thinking alone often leads people astray, and therefore one must compare one's ideas to the actual world through experimentation; only then can one see if one's ideas are based in reality. This position is known as [[empiricism]] or the [[scientific method]].

Although Aristotle initiated an important step in the history of scientific method by founding logic as a formal science, he also left behind a trail of bankrupt cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics. His cosmology would gain much acceptance up until the 1500‚Äôs, where Copernicus and Galileo began to figure out that Europe is not the center of the universe. From the 3rd century to the 1500‚Äôs, the dominant view held that the earth was the center of the universe: at this late date it is uncontroversial that the earth is not even the center of our own solar system. 

In spite of Aristotle‚Äôs bogus account of the planets and sun, he is a vital character in the history of metaphysics, both in terms of the etymology of the word, as well as a figure within metaphysics as a discipline. Dubbed ‚Äúthe stuff next to the physics.‚Äù by Andronicus of Rhodes, ‚Äúmetaphysics‚Äù became connected to the idea of ‚Äúbeyond the physical‚Äù by Simplicius, a commentator on Aristotle. Andronicus had published Aristotle‚Äôs works sometime around 43-20 BC; so initially the etymology of metaphysics was simply that which is ‚Äúnext to the physics.‚Äù

[[Aristole]] is the first who saw that &quot;All causes of things are beginnings; that we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause; that to know a thing's existence is to know the reason for its existence.&quot;{{fact}}  Setting the guidelines for all the subsequent causal theories, by specifying the number, nature, principles, elements, varieties, order, and modes of causation, Aristotle's account of the causes of things is the most comprehensive theory up to now. According to Aristotle's theory, all the causes fall into several senses, the total number of which amounts to the ways the question 'why' may be answered; namely, by reference to the matter or the ''substratum''; the ''essence'', the pattern, the form, or the structure; to the primary moving ''change'' or the agent and its action; and to the goal, the plan, the ''end'', or the good. Consequently, the major kinds of causes come under the following divisions:

The [[Material Cause]] is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination) (the part-whole causation).

The [[Formal Cause]] tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis, or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (macrostructure) is the cause of its parts (the whole-part causation).

The [[Efficient Cause]] is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.

The [[Final Cause]] is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behavior.

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. [Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or action or influence of cause and effect.] Also, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects, its presence and absent may result in different outcomes.

Besides, Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentiallly, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect

All further investigations of causality will be consisting in imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, like as final &gt; efficient&gt; material &gt; formal (Aquinas), or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).

===Chance and Spontaneity===
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

However, chance can only apply to human beings, it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, chance must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot; (Physics, 2.6).

===The Five Elements===
*'''Fire''' which is hot and dry.
*'''Earth''' which is cold and dry.
*'''Air''' which is hot and wet.
*'''Water''' which is cold and wet.
*'''Aether''' which is the divine substance that makes up the heavens

These four elements interchange (i.e. Fire &amp;#x2194; Air &amp;#x2194; Water &amp;#x2194; Earth etc.), while aether is on its own. The Sun keeps this cycle going. God keeps the Sun going (and thus the Sun is eternal).

== Aristotle's ethics ==
{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}
Although Aristotle wrote several works on [[ethics]], the major one was the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', which is considered one of Aristotle's greatest works; it discusses [[virtue]]s. The ten books which comprise it are based on notes from his lectures at the [[Lyceum]] and were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle's son, [[Nicomachus]].

Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge, like [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], but ''general knowledge''. Also, as it is a practical discipline rather than a [[theory|theoretical]] one, he thought that in order to become &quot;good,&quot; one could not simply study what virtue ''is''; one must actually do virtuous deeds.  
In order to do this, Aristotle had first to establish what was virtuous.  He began by determining that everything was done with some goal in mind and that goal is 'good.'  The ultimate goal he called the ''Highest Good''.

Aristotle contested that happiness could not be found only in pleasure or only in fame and honor. He finally finds happiness &quot;by ascertaining the specific function of man.&quot; But what is this function that will bring happiness?  To determine this, Aristotle analyzed the soul and found it to have three parts: the Nutritive Soul (plants, animals and humans), the Perceptive Soul (animals and humans) and the Rational Soul (humans only).  Thus, a human's function is to do what makes it human, to be good at what sets it apart from everything else: the ability to reason or ''Nous''. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.  Depending on how well they did this, Aristotle said people belonged to one of four categories: the Virtuous, the Continent, the Incontinent and the Vicious.

Aristotle believes that every ethical virtue is an intermediate condition between [[excess]] and [[deficiency]]. This does not mean Aristotle believed in moral relativism, however.  He set certain emotions (e.g., hate, envy, jealousy, spite, etc.) and certain actions (e.g., adultery, theft, murder, etc.) as always wrong, regardless of the situation or the circumstances.

===Nicomachean ethics===
{{main|Nicomachean Ethics}}
In ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle focuses on the importance of continually [[behavior|behaving]] virtuously and developing [[virtue]] rather than committing specific good actions. This can be contrasted with [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] ethics, in which the primary focus is on individual action. ''Nicomachean Ethics'' emphasizes the importance of context to ethical behaviour &amp;mdash; what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another. Aristotle believed that [[happiness]] is the end of life and that as long as a person is striving for [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], good deeds will result from that struggle, making the person virtuous and therefore happy.

== Aristotle's critics ==
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[Raphael Rooms|The School of Athens]]'', a fresco by [[Raphael]].  Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, whilst Plato points up to the heavens showing his belief in the ultimate truth.]]

Aristotle has been criticised on several grounds.

* His analysis of procreation is frequently criticised on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that some feminist critics refer to Aristotle as a misogynist. 
*At times, the objections that Aristotle raises against the arguments of his own teacher, [[Plato]], appear to rely on faulty interpretations of those arguments.
*Although Aristotle advised, against Plato, that knowledge of the world could only be obtained through experience, he frequently failed to take his own advice. Aristotle conducted projects of careful [[empirical]] investigation, but often drifted into [[Abstraction|abstract]] logical reasoning, with the result that his work was littered with conclusions that were not supported by empirical evidence: for example, his assertion that objects of different [[mass]] fall at different speeds under [[gravity]], which was later refuted by [[John Philoponus]] (credit is often given to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], even though Philopinus lived centuries earlier).
*In the [[Middle Ages]], roughly from the [[12th century]] to the [[15th century]], the philosophy of Aristotle became firmly established [[dogma]]. Although Aristotle himself was far from dogmatic in his approach to philosophical inquiry, two aspects of his philosophy might have assisted its transformation into dogma. His works were wide-ranging and [[systematic]] so that they could give the impression that no significant matter had been left unsettled. He was also much less inclined to employ the [[skeptic]]al methods of his predecessors, Socrates and Plato.
*Some academics have suggested that Aristotle was unaware of much of the current science of his own time.

Aristotle was called not a great philosopher, but &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholastic]] thinkers. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.

== The loss of his works ==
Though we know that Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;), the originals have been lost in time. All that we have now are the literary notes for his pupils, which are often difficult to read (the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' is a good example). It is now believed that we have about one fifth of his original works.

Aristotle underestimated the importance of his written work for humanity. He thus never published his books, except from his dialogues. The story of the original manuscripts of his treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his Geography and [[Plutarch]] in his &quot;[[Parallel Lives]], Sulla&quot;: The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to [[Theophrastus]], from Theophrastus to [[Neleus of Scepsis]], from Neleus to his heirs. Their descendants sold them to [[Apellicon of Teos]]. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] occupied Athens in [[86 BC]], he carried off the library of Appellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in [[60 BC]] from the grammarian [[Tyrranion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].

== Bibliography ==
''Note: [[Bekker numbers]] are often used to uniquely identify passages of Aristotle. They are identified below where available.''

=== Major works ===
The extant works of Aristotle are broken down according to the five categories in the ''[[Corpus Aristotelicum]]''. Not all of these works are considered genuine, but differ with respect to their connection to Aristotle, his associates and his views. Some, such as the ''Athenaion Politeia'' or the fragments of other ''politeia'' are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's &quot;school&quot; and compiled under his direction or supervision. Other works, such ''On Colours'' may have been products of Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. A final category, omitted here, includes medieval [[palmistries]], [[astrological]] and [[magical]] texts whose connection to Aristotle is purely fanciful and self-promotional. Those that are seriously disputed are marked with an asterisk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: '' ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American In Paris]]'' is also a 1951 film musical starring [[Gene Kelly]].''

'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[European-influenced classical music|symphonic]] composition by [[United States|American]] composer [[George Gershwin]] which debuted in [[1928]].  Inspired by Gershwin's time in [[Paris]], it is in the form of an extended [[tone poem]] evoking the sights and energy of the [[France|French]] capital in the [[1920s]].  In addition to the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]], the score features period automobile horns; Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi-cab horns for the New York premiere of the composition.  

* &quot;An American In Paris&quot; is second only to [[Rhapsody In Blue]] as a favorite of Gershwin's classical compositions.

* The score also features instruments rarely seen in the concert hall: [[celesta]] and [[saxophone]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Academy Awards''', popularly known as the '''Oscars''', are the most prominent [[film]] awards in the [[United States]] and arguably the world.  The Awards are granted by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], a professional honorary organization which, [[as of 2003]], had a voting membership of 5,816.  Actors (with a membership of 1,311) make up the largest voting bloc.  The votes have been tabulated and certified by auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] since close to the awards' inception. [http://www.pwc.com/extweb/newcolth.nsf/docid/540E0FBE1B2997EE85256E55005BE8FB]

The [[78th Academy Awards|next Oscars]] will take place on Sunday, [[March 5th]], [[2006]].

==Oscar statuette==
The official name of the Oscar [[statuette]] is the &quot;Academy Award of Merit.&quot; Made of [[gold]]-plated [[britannium]] on a black marble base, it is 13.5 inches (34 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lbs (3.85 kg) and depicts a [[knight]] holding a [[crusade|crusader]]'s [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film. The root of the name &quot;Oscar&quot; is contested. Some believe it comes from Academy librarian [[Margaret Herrick]], who saw it on a table and said, &quot;it looks just like my uncle Oscar!&quot; Others claim that [[Bette Davis]] named it after her first husband. However it became, the nickname stuck and is used almost as commonly as ''Academy Award'', even by the Academy itself. In fact, the Academy's domain name is ''oscars.org'' and the official website for the Academy Awards is at ''oscar.com''.

==Awards night==
The major awards are given out at a ceremony, most commonly in March following the relevant calendar year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent [[fashion]] designers of the day. The ceremony and extravagant afterparties, including the Academy's Governors Ball, are televised around the world.

The ceremony has consecutively aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] since 1976.

==Nominations==
Today, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film has to open in the previous calendar year (from [[midnight]] [[January 1]] to midnight [[December 31]]) in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify. [http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/rules/index.html]  Rule 2 states that a film must be &quot;feature-length&quot; (defined as 40 minutes) to qualify for an award (except for Short Subject awards, of course). It must also exist either on a [[35 mm film|35mm]] or [[70 mm film|70mm]] film print OR on a 24fps or 48fps [[progressive scan]] [[digital film]] print with a native resolution no lower than [[SXGA|1280x1024]].

The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields (actors are nominated by the actors' branch, etc.) while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are now allowed to vote in all categories.

==Membership==
Academy membership may be obtained by one of two ways: a competitive nomination (however, the nominee must be invited to join) or a member may submit a name, seconded by at least two other members, then voted upon by the Board of Governors. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although past press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. If a person not yet a member is nominated in more than one category in a single year, he/she must choose which branch to join when he/she accepts membership.

[[Image:Animalia.jpg|thumb|120px|Animalia Cover.]]'''Animalia''' is an illustrated [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Graeme Base]].  It was published in [[1986]].  

Animalia is an alphabet book and contains twenty six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc).  The illustrations contain dozens of small objects that the curious reader can try to identify.

Base also published a [[coloring book]] version [http://www.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?qwork=7937230&amp;wauth=Base%2C%20Graeme&amp;matches=16&amp;qsort=r&amp;cm_re=works*listing*title] for children to do their own coloring.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Temps Atomique International''' ('''TAI''') or '''International Atomic Time''' is a very accurate and stable [[time scale]].  It is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 [[atomic clock]]s (including a large number of  [[caesium]] atomic clocks) in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.  It has been available since [[1955]], and became the international standard on which [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is based on [[January 1]], [[1972]], as decided by the 14th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM). The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] is in charge of the realization of TAI.

The highest precision realization of TAI times can only be determined retrospectively, as the timescale is defined by periodic comparisons among its participating atomic clocks. However, these corrections are usually only needed for applications that require nanosecond-scale accuracy.  Most time service users use realtime estimates of TAI provided by atomic clocks that have been previously referenced to the composite timescale.  [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] is a commonly-used realtime source of time traceable back to TAI.

[[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is the basis for legal time throughout much of the world, and always differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds.  From [[1 January]] [[2006]], UTC was behind TAI by 33 seconds.  The difference is due to an initial ten second offset on [[1 January]] [[1972]] when UTC was established and [[leap second]]s, which have been periodically inserted into UTC since the first on [[30 June]] [[1972]] due to slight irregularities in Earth's rate of rotation.  While TAI is a continuous and stable timescale, UTC has intentional discontinuities to keep it from drifting more than 0.9 second from [[UT1]], a timescale defined by the Earth's rotation.  Roughly speaking, solar noon (the time at which the sun is directly overhead) would drift away from 12:00:00 without leap second corrections.  UT1 is computed by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS).  TAI was defined such that TAI = [[UT2]] on [[January 1]] [[1958]].  

Because UTC is a discontinuous timescale, it is not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during that interval.  Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead.  TAI is also commonly used by systems that can not handle leap seconds.

      <comment>/* Altruism and religion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Altruism''' is considered a belief, a practice, a habit, or an [[ethics|ethical doctrine]]. Many cultures and religious traditions judge altruism to be [[virtue|virtuous]]. In English, the idea was often described as [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule of ethics]]. In [[Buddhism]] it is considered a fundamental property of [[human nature]].

''Altruism'' can refer to:

* being helpful to other people with little or no interest in being rewarded for one's efforts (the colloquial definition). This is distinct from merely helping others.

* actions that benefit others with a net detrimental or neutral effect on the actor, regardless of the actor's own psychology, motivation, or the cause of his or her actions. This type of altruistic behavior is referred to in [[ecology]] as ''[[Commensalism]]''.

* an ethical doctrine that holds that individuals have a moral obligation to help others, if necessary to the exclusion of one's own interest or benefit. One who holds such a doctrine is known as an &quot;altruist.&quot;

The concepts have a long history in [[philosophical]] and [[ethical]] thought, and have more recently become a topic for [[psychologists]], [[sociologists]], [[evolution]]ary biologists, and [[ethology|ethologists]]. While ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism.

Altruism can be distinguished from a feeling of [[loyalty]] and [[duty]]. Altruism focuses on a moral obligation towards all [[humanity]], while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (e.g. a [[king]]), a specific organization (e.g. a [[government]]), or an abstract concept (e.g. [[God]], [[country]] etc). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. As opposed to altruism, duty is much easier to enforce by an [[authority]].

==Altruism in ethics==
''Main article: [[Altruism (ethical doctrine)]]''

The word &quot;altruism&quot; (''French, altruisme, from autrui: &quot;other people&quot;, derived from Latin alter: &quot;other&quot;'') was coined by [[Auguste Comte]], the French founder of [[positivism]], in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a moral obligation to serve the interest of others or the &quot;greater good&quot; of humanity. Comte says, in his Catechisme Positiviste, that ''&quot;[the] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This [&quot;to live for others&quot;], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely.&quot;'' As the name of the ethical doctrine is &quot;altruism,&quot; doing what the ethical doctrine prescribes has also come to be referred to by the term &quot;altruism&quot; -- serving others through placing their interests above one's own.

However, the idea that one has a moral obligation to serve others is much older than Auguste Comte. For example, many of the world's oldest and most widespread [[religion]]s (particularly [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]]) advocate it. In the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]], it is explained as follows:
:&quot;Jesus made answer and said, ''A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on [them] oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.'' Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, '''Go, and do thou likewise.'''&quot; ''(Luke 10: 30-37)''

Philosophers who support [[ethical egoism|egoism]] have argued that altruism is demeaning to the individual and that no moral obligation to help others actually exists. [[Nietzsche]] asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others are more important than one's self and that such a position is degrading and demeaning. He also claims that it was very uncommon for people in Europe to consider the sacrifice of one's own interests for others as virtuous until after the advent of Christianity. [[Ayn Rand]] argued that altruism is the willful sacrifice of one's values, and represents the reversal of morality because only a rationally selfish ethics allows one to pursue the values required for human life.

Advocates of altruism as an ethical doctrine maintain that one ought to act, or refrain from acting, so that benefit or [[good (economics)|good]] is bestowed on other people, if necessary to the exclusion of one's own interests (Note that refraining from murdering someone, for example, is not altruism since he is not receiving a benefit or being helped, as he already has his life; this would amount to the same thing as ignoring someone).

==Altruism in ethology and evolutionary biology==
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of behavior), altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. This would appear to be counter-intuitive if one presumes that [[natural selection]] acts on the individual. Natural selection, however, acts on the gene pool of the subjects, not on each subject individually. Recent developments in [[game theory]] have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:

* [[Behavioral manipulation]] (e.g., by certain [[parasites]] that can alter the behavior of the host, see [http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20060211/sc_space/mindcontrolbyparasites])
* [[Bounded rationality]] (e.g., [[Herbert Simon]])
* [[Conscience]]
* [[Indirect reciprocity]] (e.g., [[reputation]])
* [[Kin selection]] including [[eusociality]] (see also &quot;[[selfish gene]]&quot;)
* [[Meme]]s (by influencing behavior to favour their own spread, e.g.,  [[religion]])
* [[Reciprocal altruism]], mutual aid
* [[Sexual selection]]
* [[Strong reciprocity]]

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]] which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similaraties to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.

==Altruism in psychology and sociology==
If one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit, then it is not an altruistically motivated act. There are several different perspectives on how &quot;benefit&quot; (or &quot;interest&quot;) should be defined. A material gain (e.g. money, a physical reward, etc.) is clearly a form of benefit, while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains (affection, respect, happiness, satisfaction etc.) as being philosophically identical benefits.

According to ''[[psychological egoism]]'', while people can exhibit altruistic ''behavior'', they cannot have altruistic ''motivations''. Psychological egoists would say that while they might very well spend their lives benefitting others with no material benefit (or a material net loss) to themselves, their most basic motive for doing so is always to further their own interests. For example, it would be alleged that the foundational motive behind a person acting this way is to advance their own psychological well-being (&quot;good feeling&quot;). Critics of this theory often reject it on the grounds that it is [[falsifiability|non-falsifiable]]; in other words, it is designed in such a way as to be impossible to prove or disprove - because immaterial gains such as a &quot;good feeling&quot; cannot be measured or proven to exist in all people performing altruistic acts. Psychological egoism has also been accused of using [[circular logic]]: &quot;If a person willingly performs an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment&quot;. This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis (it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment).

In contrast to psychological egoism, the ''[[empathy-altruism]]'' hypothesis states that when an individual experiences empathy towards someone in need, the individual will then be altruistically motivated to help that person; that is, the individual will be primarily concerned about that person's welfare, not his or her own.  

In common parlance, altruism usually means helping another person without expecting material reward from that or other persons, although it may well entail the &quot;internal&quot; benefit of a &quot;good feeling,&quot; sense of satisfaction, self-esteem, fulfillment of duty (whether imposed by a religion or ideology or simply one's conscience), or the like. In this way one need not speculate on the motives of the altruist in question.

Humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members, previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic towards people they don't know and will never meet.  For example, humans donate to international [[charity|charities]] and volunteer their time to help [[society]]'s less fortunate. 

It strains plausibility to claim that these altruistic deeds are done in the hope of a return favor. The game theory analysis of this 'just in case' strategy, where the principle would be 'always help everyone in case you need to pull in a favor in return', is a decidedly ''non-optimal'' strategy, where the net expenditure of effort (tit) is far greater than the net profit when it occasionally pays off (tat). 

According to some, it is difficult to believe that these behaviors are solely explained as indirect selfish [[rationality]], be it conscious or sub-conscious. Mathematical formulations of [[kin selection]], along the lines of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], are helpful as far as they go; but what a [[game theory|game-theoretic]] explanation glosses over is the fact that altruistic behavior can be attributed to that apparently mysterious phenomenon, the [[conscience]]. One recent suggestion, proposed by the philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], was initially developed when considering the problem of so-called 'free riders' in the [[tragedy of the commons]], a larger-scale version of the [[prisoner's dilemma]].

In [[game theory]] terms, a free rider is an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] who draws benefits from a co-operative society without contributing. In a one-to-one situation, free riding can easily be discouraged by a tit-for-tat strategy. But in a larger-scale society, where contributions and benefits are pooled and shared, they can be incredibly difficult to shake off. 

Imagine an elementary society of co-operative organisms. Co-operative agents interact with each other, each contributing resources and each drawing on the common good. Now imagine a [[rogue]] [[free rider]], an agent who draws a favor (&quot;you scratch my back&quot;) and later refuses to return it. The problem is that free riding is always going to be beneficial to individuals at cost to society. How can well-behaved co-operative agents avoid being cheated? Over many generations, one obvious solution is for co-operators to evolve the ability to spot potential free riders in advance and refuse to enter into [[reciprocal]] arrangements with them. Then, the canonical free rider response is to evolve a more convincing [[disguise]], fooling co-operators into co-operating after all. This can lead to an evolutionary [[arms race]]s, with ever-more-sophisticated disguises and ever-more-sophisticated detectors.

In this evolutionary arms race, how best might one convince comrades that one ''really is'' a genuine co-operator, not a free rider in disguise?  One answer is by ''actually making oneself'' a  genuine co-operator, by erecting [[psychological barriers]] to breaking promises, and by advertising this fact to everyone else. In other words, a good solution is for organisms to evolve things that everyone knows will force them to be co-operators - and to make it obvious that they've evolved these things. So evolution will produce organisms who are sincerely moral and who wear their hearts on their sleeves; in short, evolution will give rise to the phenomenon of conscience. 

This theory, combined with ideas of [[kin selection]] and the one-to-one sharing of benefits, may explain how a blind and fundamentally selfish process can produce a genuinely non-cynical form of altruism that gives rise to the human conscience.

Critics of such technical game theory analysis point out that it appears to forget that human beings are rational and emotional. To presume an analysis of human behaviour without including human rationale or emotion is necessarily unrealistically narrow, and treats human beings as if they are mere machines, sometimes called [[Homo economicus]]. Another objection is that often people donate anonymously, so that it is impossible to determine if they really did the altruistic act.

Beginning with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living in a benign universe, logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place.

== Comparison of Altruism and Tit for Tat ==
Studying the simple strategy &quot;[[Tit for tat]]&quot; in the 
[[iterated prisoner's dilemma]] problem, [[game theory|game theorists]] argue that 
&quot;Tit for tat&quot; is much more successful in establishing stable [[cooperation]] among
individuals than altruism, defined as ''unconditional'' cooperation, can ever be. 

&quot;Tit for tat&quot; starts with cooperation in the first
step (as altruism does) and then just imitates the behaviour of the partner step by step. If the partner
cooperates, then he ''rewards'' him with cooperation, if he doesn't, then he 
''punishes'' him by not cooperating in the next step. 

Confronted with many strategies that try to exploit or abuse cooperation of others, this 
simple strategy surprisingly proved to be the most successful (see [[The Evolution of Cooperation]]). 
It was even more successful than these abusing strategies, while unconditional cooperativity (altruism) was
one of the most unsuccessful strategies.  
Confronted with altruistic behaviour, Tit for tat is indistinguishable from 
pure altruism. [[Robert Axelrod]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] also showed that 
altruism may be harmful to society by nourishing exploiters and abusers (and making them more and
more powerful until they can force everyone to cooperate unconditionally), which
is not the case for &quot;Tit for tat&quot;. (See also comparison of [[entrepreneur]] and [[entredonneur]])

In the context of [[biology]], the &quot;Tit for tat&quot; strategy is also called [[reciprocal altruism]].

==Altruism in politics==
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan='2' align='center'&gt;'''There is currently a [[WP:NPOV|POV]] [[WP:DR|dispute]] as to the wording of the section shown below.'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign='top'&gt;
If one is an adherent to the ''ethical doctrine'' called altruism (that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others), then one will support the kind of politics that one believes to be most effective in furthering the welfare of others, regardless of the effect this may have on oneself. Since there is no general consensus on what kind of politics results in the greatest benefit for others, different altruists may have very different political views.

With regard to their political convictions, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe altruism is a matter of personal choice (and therefore selfishness can and should be tolerated), and those who believe that altruism is a moral ideal which should be embraced, if possible, by all human beings.

A prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is [[Lysander Spooner]], who, in ''Natural Law'', writes: &quot;''Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenceless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will, perform them.''&quot;

The latter branch of altruist political thought, on the other hand, argues that [[egoism]] should be actively discouraged, and that altruists have a duty not only to help other people, but to teach those people to help each other as well. Thus, in politics, these altruists almost always take a [[left-wing]] stance, ranging from moderate [[social democracy]] to [[socialism]] or even [[communism]]. Moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of [[tax|taxation-funded]] government programs aimed at benefiting the needy (for example [[transfer payments]], such as [[social welfare]], or [[public healthcare]] and [[public education]]). Less obvious things such as a law that motorists pull over to let emergency vehicles pass may also be justified by appealing to the altruism ethic. Finally, radical altruists of this branch may take things further and advocate some form of [[collectivism]] or [[communalism]].

On a somewhat related note, altruism is often held - even by non-altruists - to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions of power. Such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace. When they do not, they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign='top'&gt;
Politicians often speak of a moral obligation of individuals to help others. For example, [[George Bush]], speaking to the [[United Nations]] said: &quot;We have a moral obligation to help others -- and a moral duty to make sure our actions are effective.&quot;

If one is an adherent to the ''ethical doctrine'' called altruism (that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others), it can become a moral justification for forcing, or advocating forcing individuals to help others. In the realm of politics, the altruist may employ an agent in the form of [[government]] to enforce this supposed moral obligation. This is not to say that an ethical altruist will ''necessarily'' force this on anyone. An altruist may allow others the freedom to behave in a manner they believe to be immoral or selfish. In other words, their ethical doctrine would not manifest itself politically.

With regard those who believe benevolence is a moral obligation, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe helping others is a moral obligation but should not be enforced on individuals. And, those who believe that since helping others is a moral obligation, forcing individuals to help others if they are not willing on their own is justified.

A prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is [[Lysander Spooner]], who, in ''Natural Law'', writes: &quot;''Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenceless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will, perform them.''&quot; 

The latter branch of altruist political thought, on the other hand, argues that [[egoism]] should be actively discouraged, and that individuals should be forced to help other people. Thus, in politics, these altruists almost always take a [[left-wing]] stance, ranging from moderate [[social democracy]] to [[socialism]] or even [[communism]]. Moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of [[tax|taxation-funded]] government programs aimed at benefiting the needy (for example [[transfer payments]], such as [[social welfare]], or [[public healthcare]] and [[public education]]). Finally, radical altruists of this branch may take things to an extreme and advocate some form of state-enforced [[collectivism]], [[communalism]], or communism. This is in line with August Comte's philosophy (who coined the term altruism), which argues against individual rights.

Finally, many believe that helping others or serving society is not a moral obligation at all, but that altrusm is an arbitrary pronouncement not philosophically derivable. These oppose all government-enforced charity. [[Individualist anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in 1847 warns of enforcing charity: &quot;That is why charity, the prime virtue of the Christian, the legitimate hope of the socialist, the object of all the efforts of the economist, is a social vice the moment it is made a principle of constitution and a law; that is why certain economists have been able to say that legal charity had caused more evil in society than proprietary usurpation&quot; (''The Philosophy of Poverty'').

Comte asserts that individual rights are not compatible with the supposed obligation to serve others. Some argue that the ethical doctrine, if taken to its logical conclusion, leads to tyranny.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Altruism and religion==
{{sect-stub}}
All the major world [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]] place particular emphasis on altruistic morality, as noted above, but [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] also promote altruistic behavior.
The [[Good Samaritan]] is a famous [[New Testament]] parable appearing only in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (10:25-37). The parable is told by [[Jesus]] illustrating altruism.
 &lt;!-- This section should continue by quoting altruism-related verses from the holy books of the aforementioned religions --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ang_lee.jpg|frame|Lee accepting the Best Foreign Film award for ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' at the 73rd Academy Awards]]
'''Ang Lee''' (Chinese: ÊùéÂÆâ; Pinyin: L«ê ƒÄn ) (born [[October 23]], [[1954]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[film director]]  from [[Taiwan]].

==Early life==
Ang Lee was born and raised in [[Pingtung County|Pingtung, Taiwan]] and educated in the [[United States]], where he found success as a [[Hollywood]] director, well-known for his [[wuxia]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''  (2000).

He completed his bachelor's degree in Theater from the [[University of Illinois]] and received his [[MFA]] from [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], where in 1984 he made a thesis film called ''Fine Line''. He was a classmate of [[Spike Lee]] and worked on the crew of the latter Lee's thesis film, ''Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads''. 

==Career==
Many of his films have focused on the interactions between modernity and tradition. His films have also tended to have a light-hearted comic tone which marks a break from the tragic historical realism which characterized Taiwanese filmmaking after the end of the martial law period in 1987. Lee's films also tend to draw on deep secrets and internal torment that begin to come to the surface such as the gay-themed films ''[[The Wedding Banquet]]'' (1993), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), the martial arts epic ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and the comic book adaptation ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003)

He received the Dartmouth Film Award in 2002, along with [[Meryl Streep]].

Lee's film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005) won the best film award at the Venice International Film Festival and was named 2005's best film by the Los Angeles film critics. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Motion Picture ‚Äî Drama, with Lee winning the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Director. Lee also won the Best Director award for the film at the 2006 British Academy Awards (BAFTAs). In January 2006, Brokeback scored a leading 8 [[Academy Award]] nominations including Lee for Best Director.  The film is considered to be the frontrunner for the March 5, 2006 ceremony.  He taught [[Meryl Streep]]'s son and [[Kai Christophe Wong]], initially scheduled for the lead in ''[[Dark Matter]]''.

==Private life==
His wife, Jane, is a microbiologist; they have two children, Haan and Mason.
He is a huge fan of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. He kept his directing aspirations a secret because his culture did not encourage ambitions in a non-practical career like film.

'''Ayn Rand''' ({{IPA2|ajn …π√¶nd}}, {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}} &amp;ndash; [[March 6]] [[1982]]), born '''Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum''', was best known for her [[philosophy]] of [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivism]] and her novels ''[[We the Living]]'', ''[[Anthem (novel)|Anthem]]'', ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Her philosophy and her fiction both emphasize, above all, the concepts of [[individualism]], rational [[egoism]] (&quot;[[Objectivist ethics|rational self-interest]]&quot;), and [[capitalism]], which she believed should be implemented fully via ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]]. Her politics has been described as [[minarchism]] and [[libertarianism]], though she never used the first term and detested the second.

Her novels were based upon the projection of the Randian [[hero]], a man whose ability and independence causes conflict with the masses, but who perseveres nevertheless to achieve his values. Rand viewed this hero as the ideal, and the express goal of her fiction was to showcase such heroes. 

She believed:
*That man must choose his values and actions by reason; 
*That the individual has a right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing self to others nor others to self; and 
*That no one has the right to seek values from others by physical force, or impose ideas on others by physical force.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rand was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and was the eldest of three daughters of a [[Jew]]ish family. Her parents were [[agnostic]] and largely non-observant. From an early age, she displayed a strong interest in literature and films. She started writing screenplays and novels from the age of seven. Her mother taught her French and subscribed to a magazine featuring stories for boys, where Rand found her first childhood hero: Cyrus Paltons, an Indian army officer in a [[Rudyard Kipling]]-style story called &quot;The Mysterious Valley&quot;. Throughout her youth, she read the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Alexandre Dumas]] and other Romantic writers, and expressed a passionate enthusiasm toward the Romantic movement as a whole. She discovered [[Victor Hugo]] at the age of thirteen, and fell deeply in love with his novels. Later, she cited him as her favorite novelist and the greatest novelist of world literature. She studied philosophy and history at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]]. Her major literary discoveries in university were the works of [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. She admired Rostand for his richly romantic imagination and Schiller for his grand, heroic scale. She admired Dostoevsky for his sense of drama and his intense moral judgments, but was deeply against his philosophy and his sense of life. She continued to write short stories and screenplays and wrote sporadically in her diary, which contained intensely anti-Soviet ideas. She also encountered the philosophical ideas of [[Nietzsche]], and loved his exaltation of the heroic and independent individual who embraced egoism and rejected altruism in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Though an early fan of Nietzsche, she eventually became critical, seeing his philosophy as emphasizing emotion over reason. Nevertheless, as Allan Gotthelf points out in book ''On Ayn Rand'', &quot;the influence was real.&quot; She did still retain an admiration for some of his ideas, and quoted Nietzsche in the introduction to the 25th aniversary edition of ''The Fountainhead'': &quot;''The noble soul has reverence for itself.''&quot; Her greatest influence by far is [[Aristotle]], especially ''Organon (Logic)''. Although Leonard Peikoff, promoter of her ideas, says she is the greatest philosopher who ever lived, she herself considered Aristotle the greatest philosopher ever, and stated that he was the only philosopher who had influenced her (this is probably because, as she has stated, she did not include her own work when analyzing the culture.) She then entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting; in late 1925, however, she was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives. She arrived in the [[United States]] in February 1926, at the age of twenty-one. After a brief stay with her relatives in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], she resolved never to return to the [[Soviet Union]], and set out for [[Hollywood]] to become a [[screenwriter]]. She then changed her name to &quot;Ayn Rand&quot;. There is a story told that she named herself after the [[Remington Rand]] [[typewriter]], but she began using the name Ayn Rand before the typewriter was first sold. She stated that her first name, 'Ayn', was an adaptation of the name of a Finnish writer. This may have been the Finnish-Estonian author [[Aino Kallas]], but variations of this name are common in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking regions.

===Major works===
Initially, Rand struggled in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. While working as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] on [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings|King of Kings]]'', she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]], who caught her eye. The two married in 1929. In 1931, Rand became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Her first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' in 1932 to [[Universal Studios]]. Rand then wrote the play ''[[The Night of January 16th]]'' in 1934, which was highly successful, and published two novels, ''[[We the Living]]'' (1936), and ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' (1938). While ''We the Living'' met with mixed reviews in the U.S. and positive reviews in the U.K., ''Anthem'' received significiant and positive reviews only in England, due in part to its odd publication history.  She was up against [[The Red Decade ]] in America, and ''Anthem'' did not even find a publisher in the United States; it was first published in England. Besides, Rand had still not perfected her literary style and these novels cannot be considered representative.

Without Rand's knowledge or permission, ''[[We The Living]]'' was made into a pair of films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira'' in 1942 by Scalara Films, [[Rome]]. They were nearly censored by the [[Italy|Italian]] government under [[Benito Mussolini]], but they were permitted because the novel upon which they were based was anti-Soviet. The films were successful and the public easily realized that they were as much against Fascism as Communism, and the government banned them quickly  thereafter. These films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.

Rand's first major professional success came with her best-selling novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943), which she wrote over a period of seven years. The novel was rejected by twelve publishers, who thought it was too intellectual and opposed to the mainstream of American thought. It was finally accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] publishing house, thanks mainly to a member of the editorial board, Archibald Ogden, who praised the book in the highest terms and finally prevailed.  Eventually, ''The Fountainhead'' was a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.

The theme of ''The Fountainhead'' is &quot;individualism and collectivism in man's soul&quot;. It features the lives of five main characters. The hero, Howard Roark, is Rand's ideal, a noble soul ''par excellence'', an architect who is firmly and serenely devoted to his own ideals and believes that no man should copy the style of another in any field, especially architecture. All the other characters in the novel demand that he renounce his values, but Roark maintains his integrity. Unlike traditional heroes who launch into long and passionate monologues about their integrity and the unfairness of the world; Roark, in contrast, does it with a disdainful, almost contemptuous taciturnity and laconicism.

Rand's [[magnum opus]], ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', was published in 1957, becoming an international bestseller. ''Atlas Shrugged'' is often seen as Rand's most complete statement of the [[Objectivist philosophy]] in any of her works of fiction. In its appendix, she offered this summary:
:&quot;My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;

The theme of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is &quot;The role of man's mind in society&quot;. Rand upheld the industrialist as one of the most admirable members of any society and fiercely opposed the popular resentment accorded to industrialists. This led her to envision a novel wherein the industrialists of America go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway. The American economy and its society in general slowly start to collapse. The government responds by increasing the already stifling controls on industrial concerns. The novel deals with issues as complex and divergent as sex, music, medicine, politics, and human ability.

Along with [[Nathaniel Branden]], his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and others including [[Alan Greenspan]] and [[Leonard Peikoff]], (jokingly designated &quot;[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]&quot;), Rand launched the [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] movement to promote her philosophy.

===The Objectivist movement===
''Main article: The [[Objectivist movement]]''

In 1950 Rand moved to [[New York City]], where in  1951 she met the young [[psychology]] student [[Nathaniel Branden]] [http://www.nathanielbranden.com], who had read her book, ''The Fountainhead'', at the age of 14. Branden, then 19, enjoyed discussing Rand's emerging Objectivist philosophy with her. Together, Branden and some of his other friends formed a group that they dubbed the [[Collective]], which included some participation by future Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]]. After several years, Rand and Branden's friendly relationship blossomed into a romantic affair, despite the fact that both were married at the time. Their spouses were both convinced to accept this affair but it eventually led to the separation and then divorce of [[Nathaniel Branden]] from his wife. Although one of Rand's most strident philosophical points was never to bow to societal pressure or norms, Ayn Rand abandoned her own name (see top of page), as did Branden (born Nathan Blumenthal). 

Throughout the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]], Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through both her fiction [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_fiction] and non-fiction [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_nonfiction] works, and by giving talks at several east-coast universities, largely through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (&quot;the NBI&quot;) which Branden established to promote her philosophy. 

After a convoluted series of separations, Rand abruptly ended her relationship with both Nathaniel Branden and his wife, [[Barbara Branden]], in 1968 when she learned of Nathaniel Branden's affair with Patrecia Scott (this later affair did not overlap chronologically with the earlier Branden/Rand affair).  Rand refused to have any further dealings with the NBI.  She then published a letter in &quot;The Objectivist&quot; announcing her repudiation of Branden for various reasons, including dishonesty, but did not mention their affair or her role in the schism. The two never reconciled, and Branden remained a ''persona non grata'' in the Objectivist movement.

Barbara Branden presented an account of the breakup of the affair in her book, ''The Passion of Ayn Rand.'' She describes the encounter between Nathaniel and Rand, saying that Rand slapped him numerous times, and denounced him in these words: &quot;If you have an ounce of morality left in you, an ounce of psychological health ‚Äî you'll be impotent for the next twenty years! And if you achieve any potency, you'll know it's a sign of still worse moral degradation!&quot;

Conflicts continued in the wake of the break with Branden and the subsequent collapse of the NBI. Many of her closest &quot;Collective&quot; friends began to part ways, and during the late 70's, her activities within the formal Objectivist movement began to decline, a situation which increased after the death of her husband in 1979. One of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.

Rand died of heart failure on [[March 6]], [[1982]] in [[New York City]], years after having successfully battled cancer, and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].

===Philosophical influences===
Rand rejected virtually all other philosophical schools. She acknowledged a shared intellectual lineage with [[Aristotle]] and [[John Locke]], and more generally with the philosophies of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Age of Reason]].  She occasionally remarked with approval on specific philosophical positions of, e.g., [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. She seems also to have respected the American rationalist [[Brand Blanshard]]. However, she regarded most philosophers as at best incompetent and at worst downright evil. She singled out [[Immanuel Kant]] as the most influential of the latter sort.

Nonetheless, there are connections between Rand's views and those of other philosophers. She acknowledged that she had been influenced at an early age by the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Though she later repudiated his thought and reprinted her first novel, ''[[We The Living]]'', with some wording changes in 1959, her own thought grew out of critical interaction with it.  Generally, her political thought is in the tradition of [[classical liberalism]]. She expressed qualified enthusiasm for the economic thought of [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Henry Hazlitt]]. Though not mentioned as an influence by her specifically, parallels between her works and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay [[Self-Reliance]] do exist.  Later Objectivists, such as [[Richard Salsman]], have claimed that Rand's economic theories are implicitly more supportive of the doctrines of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], though Rand herself was likely not acquainted with his work.

===Politics and House Committee on Un-American Activities testimony===
Rand's political views were radically pro-[[capitalist]], [[anti-statist]], and [[anti-Communist]]. Her writings praised above all the human individual and the creative genius of which one is capable. She exalted what she saw as the heroic [[American values]] of egoism and individualism. Rand also had a strong dislike for [[mysticism]], [[religion]], and compulsory [[charity]], all of which she believed helped foster a crippling culture of resentment towards individual human happiness and success.  Rand detested many prominent [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[conservative]] politicians of her time, even including prominent anti-Communist crusaders like Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and Senators [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] and [[Joseph McCarthy]] (although she argued that ''[[McCarthyism]]'' was a myth, and that the accusation of McCarthyism was used as an [[ad hominem]] argument to discredit anti-Communists).

In 1947, during the [[Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (see [[http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/texts/huac.html]]). Rand's testimony involved analysis of the 1943 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''. While many believe that Ayn Rand disclosed the names of members of the Communist Party in the U.S., thus exposing them to [[blacklisting]], her testimony consisted entirely of comments regarding the disparity between her experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the fanciful portrayal of it in the film.

Rand argued that the movie grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union. She told the committee that the film presented life in the USSR as being much better than it actually was. Apparently this 1943 film was intentional wartime [[propaganda]] by U.S. patriots, trying to put their Soviet allies in [[World War II]] under the best possible light. After the HUAC hearings, when Ayn Rand was asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of their investigations, she described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.

==Legacy==
Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. [http://www.eckerd.edu/aspec/writers/atlas_shrugged.htm]

In 1985, [[Leonard Peikoff]], a surviving member of &quot;[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]&quot; and Ayn Rand's designated heir, established &quot;The [[Ayn Rand Institute]]: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism&quot; (ARI). The Institute has since registered the name ''Ayn Rand'' as a trademark, despite Rand's desire that her name never be used to promote the philosophy she developed. Rand expressed her wish to keep her name and the philosophy of Objectivism separate to ensure the survival of her ideas. 	 
	 
Another schism in the movement occurred in 1989, when Objectivist [[David Kelley]] wrote &quot;A Question of Sanction,&quot; [http://www.wetheliving.com/boston/sanction.html] in which he defended his choice to speak to non-Objectivist [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups. Kelley stated that Objectivism was not a &quot;closed system&quot; and should engage with other philosophies. Peikoff, in an article for ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]'' called &quot;Fact and Value&quot; [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_f-v], argued that Objectivism is, indeed, a closed system, and that truth and moral goodness are directly related. Peikoff expelled Kelley from his movement, whereupon Kelley founded The Institute for Objectivist Studies (now known as &quot;[[The Objectivist Center]]&quot;).	 

Rand and Objectivism are less well known outside [[North America]], although there are pockets of interest in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], and her novels are reported to be popular in [[India]] ([http://www.theatlasphere.com/metablog/000058.php]) and to be gaining an increasingly wider audience in [[Africa]]. Her work has had little effect on academic philosophy, for her followers are, with some notable exceptions, drawn from the non-academic world.

[[Neil Peart]], the drummer and lyricist with the Canadian progressive rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], was influenced by Rand philosophy during the early years of the band. The most notable instances of this are the track &quot;Anthem&quot; from the album ''[[Fly By Night]]'' ([[1975]]) and the title track from the album ''[[2112]]'' ([[1976]]).

==Controversy==
Rand's views are controversial. Religious and socially conservative thinkers have criticized her atheism. Many adherents and practitioners of [[continental philosophy]] criticize her celebration of rationality and self-interest. Within the dominant philosophical movement in the English-speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]], Rand's work has been mostly ignored. No leading research university in this tradition considers Rand or Objectivism to be an important philosophical specialty or research area, as is documented by [[Brian Leiter]]'s report [http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/]. Some academics, however, are trying to bring Rand's work into the mainstream. For instance, the [http://www.aynrandsociety.org/ Ayn Rand Society], founded in 1987, is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]]. In 2006, [[Cambridge University Press]] will publish a volume on Rand's ethical theory written by ARI-affiliated scholar [[Tara Smith]].

A notable exception to the general lack of attention paid to Rand is the essay &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by [[Harvard University]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], which appears in his collection ''Socratic Puzzles''. Nozick's own [[libertarian]] political conclusions are similar to Rand's, but his essay criticizes her foundational argument in ethics, which claims that one's own life is, for each individual, the only ultimate value because it makes all other values possible. To make this argument sound, Nozick argues that Rand still needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer the state of eventually dying and having no values. Thus, he argues, her attempt to deduce the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of assuming the conclusion or [[begging the question]] and that her solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, Nozick respected Rand as an author and noted that he found her books enjoyable and thought-provoking.

Rand has sometimes been viewed with suspicion for her practice of presenting her philosophy in fiction and non-fiction books aimed at a general audience rather than publishing in [[peer-review]]ed journals. Rand's defenders note that she is part of a long tradition of authors who wrote philosophically rich fiction ‚Äî including [[Dante]], [[John Milton]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], and [[Albert Camus]], and that other philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] presented their philosophies in both fictional and non-fictional forms.

Other critics argue that Rand‚Äôs idealistic philosophy and her [[Romantic]] literary style are not applicable to the inhabited world. In particular, these critics claim that Rand's novels are made up of unrealistic and one-dimensional characters. They criticize the portrayal of the Objectivist heroes as incredibly intelligent, unencumbered by doubt, wealthy, and free of flaws, in contrast to the frequent portrayal of the antagonists as weak, pathetic, full of uncertainty, and lacking in imagination and talent.

Defenders of Rand point out counterexamples to these criticisms: neither Eddie Willers nor Cherryl Taggart (both positive characters) is especially gifted or intelligent, but both are characters of dignity and respect; Leo Kovalensky suffers enormously due to his inability to cope with the brutality and banality of communism; Andrei Taganov dies after realizing his philosophical errors; Dominique Francon is initially bitterly unhappy because she believes evil is powerful; Hank Rearden is torn by inner emotional conflict brought on by a philosophical contradiction; and Dagny Taggart thinks that she alone is capable of saving the world. Two of her main protagonists, Howard Roark and John Galt, did not begin life wealthy. Though Rand believed that, under capitalism, valuable contributions will routinely be rewarded by wealth, she certainly did not think that wealth made a person virtuous. In fact, she presents many vicious bureaucrats and waspish elitists who use [[statism]] to accumulate money and power. Moreover, Hank Rearden is exploited because of his social na√Øvet√©. As for the purportedly weak and pathetic villains, Rand's defenders point out that Ellsworth Toohey is represented as being a great strategist and communicator from an early age, and Dr. Robert Stadler is a brilliant scientist.

Rand herself replied to these literary criticisms (and in advance of much of them) with her essay &quot;The Goal of My Writing&quot; (1963). There, and in other essays collected in her book ''[[The Romantic Manifesto|The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature]]'' (2nd rev. ed. 1975), Rand makes it clear that her goal is to project her vision of an ideal man: not man as he is, but man as he might and ought to be.

Rand's views on sex have also led to some controversy.  According to her, &quot;For a woman ''qua'' woman, the essence of femininity is hero-worship ‚Äì the desire to look up to man.&quot; (1968)  Some in the [[BDSM]] community see her work as relevant and supportive, particularly  ''The Fountainhead'' [http://www.mistressmorgana.com/site04/read_rec.html].

Another source of controversy is Rand's view that homosexuality is &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot; [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/homo/atlasphere.htm], as well as her support for the right of businesses to discriminate on the basis of homosexuality, such as in their hiring practices.  Specifically, she stated that &quot;there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality&quot; because &quot;it involves psychological flaws, corruptions, errors, or unfortunate premises&quot;.  

On the topic of non-governmental discrimination, Rand's defenders argue that her support for its legality was motivated by holding property rights above civil or human rights (as she did not believe that human rights were distinct from property rights) so it did not constitute an endorsement of the morality of the prejudice itself. In support of this, they cite Rand's opposition to some prejudices &amp;mdash; though not homophobia &amp;mdash; on moral grounds, in essays like 'Racism' and 'Global Balkanization', while still arguing for the right of individuals and businesses to act on such prejudice without government intervention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alain Connes''' (born [[April 1]], [[1947]]) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[College de France]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]), [[IHES]] ([[Bures-sur-Yvette]], [[France]]) and [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]). He is a specialist of [[Von Neumann algebra]]s and succeeded in completing the classification of [[factor]]s of these objects. Although his work in physics was not very convincing he tried to connect the planckian scales with what he called a &quot;2-brane&quot; Universe, model which was largely rejected by string theorists so far.

The remarkable links between this subject, the tools he and others devised to tackle the problem and other subjects in [[theoretical physics]], [[particle physics]], and [[differential geometry]], made him emphasize [[Noncommutative geometry]] (which is also the title of his major book to date).

He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in [[1982]], the [[Crafoord Prize]] in [[2001]] and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Allan Dwan''' ([[April 3]], [[1885 in film|1885]] &amp;ndash; [[December 21]], [[1981 in film|1981]]) was a pioneering [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[film|motion picture]] [[film director|director]], producer and screenwriter.

Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], his family moved to the [[United States]] when he was eleven years of age. At university, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. However, he had  a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in [[California]] where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in [[1911]], Dwan began working part time in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. While still in New York, in [[1917 in film|1917]] he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].

Allan Dwan became a true innovator in the motion picture industry. After making a series of westerns and comedies,  he directed fellow Canadian, [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed [[1922 in film|1922]] ''[[Robin Hood]]''. 

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in [[1937 in film|1937]] he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' the following year.

Over his long and successful career spanning over fifty years, he directed over 400 motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the [[1949 in film|1949]] box office smash, ''[[The Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. His last movie was in [[1961]]. 

Dwan is one of the directors who spanned the silent to sound era. Most of the silent movies he directed are lost due to poor preservation. Little historical writing has been devoted to Dwan, but some believe that he will be the last &quot;discovered&quot; great director from the [[Classic Hollywood Era]].

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]]. 

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].

{{Economy of Algeria table}}
In the '''economy of Algeria''' the [[hydrocarbons]] sector is the backbone, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. [[Algeria]] has the fifth-largest reserves of [[natural gas]] in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world stalled in [[1992]] as the country became embroiled in political turmoil.

Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in April [[1994]] and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended [[30 April]], [[1998]]. Some progress on economic reform, [[Paris Club]] [[debt rescheduling]]s in [[1995]] and [[1996]], and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth since 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget deficit. Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since [[1999]]. The country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in [[1999]] to its current level of $24 billion. The spike in oil prices in [[1999]]-[[2000]] and the government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the [[November 10]], [[2001]] floods and an uncertain oil market make prospects for [[2002]]-[[2003|03]] more problematic. The government pledges to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector. However, it has thus far had little success in reducing high unemployment, officially estimated at 30% and improving living standards.

[[President Bouteflika]] has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.  Other priority areas include banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government bureaucracy.

The government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement with the [[European Union]]; it has started accession negotiations for entry into the [[World Trade Organization]]. 

===[[Agriculture]]===

Since Roman times Algeria has been noted for the fertility of its soil.  About a quarter of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits.  More than 7,500,000 acres (30,000 km&amp;sup2;) are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s.  The Tell is the grain-growing land.  During the time of [[France|French]] rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[Artesian aquifer|artesian well]]s in districts which only required water to make them fertile.  Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals.  A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and of [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, is exported.  

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time of the [[United States]]' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards.  In the early years of the 20th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed.  A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases.  Large quantities of [[crin vegetal]] (vegetable horse-hair) an excellent fibre, are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm.  The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and [[Petroleum]]) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success.

Algeria also exports [[fig]]s, [[date (fruit)|date]]s, [[esparto]] grass, and [[cork (material)|cork]].

====Wine Production====

Throughout Algeria the soil favours the growth of vines.  The country, in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the French government, 
:&quot;can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste.&quot; 

The growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists, but it was not until vineyards in [[France]] were attacked by [[phylloxera]] that the export of [[wine]] from Algeria became significant.  In [[1883]], despite precautionary measures, Algerian [[vineyard]]s were also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved.  In 1850 less than 2000 acres (8 km&amp;sup2;) were devoted to the grape, but in 1878 this had increased to over 42,000 acres (170 km&amp;sup2;), which yielded 7,436,000 gallons (28,000 m&amp;sup3;) of wine.  Despite bad seasons and ravages of insects, cultivation extended, and in 1895 the vineyards covered 300,000 acres (1,200 km&amp;sup2;), the produce being 88,000,000 gallons (333,000 m&amp;sup3;).  The area of cultivation in 1905 exceeded 400,000 acres (1,600 km&amp;sup2;), and in that year the amount of wine produced was 157,000,000 gallons (594,000 m&amp;sup3;).  By that time the limits of profitable production had been reached in many parts of the country.  Practically the only foreign market for Algerian wine is France, which in 1905 imported about 110,000,000 gallons (416,000 m&amp;sup3;).

===Fishing===

Fishing is a flourishing but minor industry.  Fish caught are principally [[sardine]]s, [[bonito]], [[smelt]] and [[sprat]]s.  Fresh fish are exported to [[France]], dried and preserved fish to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].  Coral [[fishery|fisheries]] are found along the coast from [[Bona]] to [[Tunis]].

===Minerals===

Algeria is rich in minerals; the country has many [[iron]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[calamine]], [[antimony]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mines.  The most productive are those of iron and zinc.  Lignite is found in Algiers; immense [[phosphate]] beds were discovered near [[Tebessa]] in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905.  Phosphate beds are also worked near [[Setif]], [[Guelma]] and [[Ain Beida]].  There are more than 300 quarries which produce, amongst other stones, [[onyx]] and beautiful white and red [[marble]]s.  Algerian onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have been found near [[Kleber]], some being certainly those from which the long-lost Numidian marbles were taken.  [[Salt]] is collected on the margins of the chotts.

==Foreign trade==

Under French administration the commerce of Algeria developed greatly: the total imports and exports at the time of the French occupation (1830) did not exceed ¬£ 175,000.  In 1850 the figures had reached ¬£ 5,000,000; in 1868, ¬£ 12,000,000; in 1880, ¬£ 17,000,000; and in 1890, ¬£ 20,000,000.  From this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year.  In 1905 the total value of the foreign trade was ¬£ 24,500,000.  About five-sixths of the trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867.  French goods, except [[sugar]], have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835.  After the increase, in 1892, of the French minimum tariff, which applied to Algeria also, foreign trade greatly diminished. 

By far Algeria's most significant exports, financially, are [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].  The reserves are mostly in the Eastern [[Sahara]]; the Algerian government curbed the exports in the 1980s to slow depletion; exports increased again somewhat in the [[1990|1990s]].  Other significant exports are [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[ox]]en, and [[horse]]s; animal products, such as [[wool]] and skins; [[wine]], cereals ([[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s (chiefly [[fig]]s and [[grape]]s for the table) and [[seed]]s, [[esparto]] grass, oils and vegetable extracts (chiefly [[olive oil]]), [[iron]] ore, [[zinc]], natural [[phosphate]]s, [[timber]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], [[crin vegetal]] and [[tobacco]].  The import of [[wool]] exceeds the export.  [[Sugar]], [[coffee]], machinery, metal work of all kinds, clothing and pottery are largely imported.  Of these by far the greater part comes from France.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] imports consist chiefly of [[coal]], cotton fabrics and machinery.

===Exports===

Algeria trades most extensively with France and [[Italy]], in terms of both imports and exports, but also trades with the United States and [[Spain]].

The '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤ÿßÿ¶ÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÖŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ∑Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿπÿ®Ÿäÿ©''') , or '''Algeria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤ÿßÿ¶ÿ±'''), is a presidential state in [[north Africa]], and the second largest country on the [[Africa]]n continent, [[Sudan]] being the largest.  It is bordered by [[Tunisia]] in the northeast, [[Libya]] in the east, [[Niger]] in the southeast, [[Mali]] and [[Mauritania]] in the southwest, and [[Morocco]] as well as a few kilometers of its annexed territory, [[Western Sahara]], in the west. [[Constitution of Algeria|Constitutionally]], it is defined as  an [[Islam]]ic, [[Arab]], and [[Amazigh]] (Berber) country.  The name Algeria is derived from the name of the city of [[Algiers]], from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''al-jazƒÅ‚Äôir'', which translates as ''the islands'', referring to the four islands which lay off that city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525.



==History==
{{main|History of Algeria}}

Algeria has been inhabited by [[Berber]]s (or Amazigh) since at least [[10,000 BC]].  From [[1000 BC]] on, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] became an influence on them, establishing settlements along the coast. Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably [[Numidia]], and seized the opportunity offered by the Punic Wars to become independent of Carthage, only to be taken over soon after by the [[Roman Republic]] in 200 BC.  As the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed, the Berbers became independent again in much of the area, while the [[Vandals]] took over parts until later expelled by the generals of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], [[Justinian I]].  The [[Byzantine Empire]] then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the [[Arab]]s in the [[8th century]].

[[Image:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria]]
After some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as [[Kusayla]] and [[Kahina]], the Berbers adopted [[Islam]] ''en masse'', but almost immediately expelled the [[Caliphate]] from Algeria, establishing an [[Ibadi]] state under the [[Rustamid]]s.  Having converted the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the Rustamids, and conquered Egypt.  They left Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid]] vassals; when the latter rebelled and adopted [[Sunni]]sm, they sent in a populous [[Arab]] tribe, the [[Banu Hilal]], to weaken them, thus incidentally initiating the [[Arabization]] of the countryside.  The [[Almoravid]]s and [[Almohad]]s, Berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers, brought a period of relative peace and development; however, with the Almohads' collapse, Algeria became a battleground for their three [[successor state]]s, the Algerian [[Zayyanid]]s, Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s, and Moroccan [[Merinid]]s.  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, [[Spain]] started attacking and taking over many coastal cities, prompting some to seek help from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algeria was brought into the Ottoman Empire by [[Khair ad Din|Khair ad-Din]] and his  brother [[Aruj]], who established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Privateer|corsairs]]; their privateering peaked in Algiers in the 1600s. Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]] with the [[United States]]. On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[France|French]] invaded Algiers in 1830; however, intense resistance from such personalities as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]] made for a slow conquest of Algeria, not technically completed until the early 1900s when the last [[Tuareg]] were conquered.
[[Image:Constantine Algerien 002.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine, Algeria 1840]]

Meanwhile, however, the French suppressed slavery and made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Italy, Spain, and Malta moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupy the most prized parts of Algeria's cities, benefiting from the French government's confiscation of communally held land. People of European descent in Algeria (the so-called ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]''), as well as the native Algerian Jews, were full French citizens starting from the end of the 19th century; by contrast, the vast majority of Muslim Algerians (even veterans of the French army) remained outside of French law, possessing neither French citizenship nor the right to vote. Algeria's social fabric was stretched to breaking point during this period: literacy dropped massively, while land confiscation uprooted much of the population.

In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Algerian War of Independence]]; after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare, they succeeded in pushing France out in 1962. Most of the 1,025,000 ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', as well as 91,000 ''[[harki]]s'' (pro-French Muslim Algerians serving in the French Army), together forming about 10% of the population of Algeria in 1962, fled Algeria for France in just a few months in the middle of that year.

[[Image:TheBattleofAlgiers.png|thumb|right|''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' is a movie about the [[Algerian War of Independence]].]]
Algeria's first president, the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, [[Houari Boum√©di√®nne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial, and this trend continued throughout Boumedienne's government; however, Boumedienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role.  Agriculture was collectivised, and a massive industrialization drive launched.  Oil extraction facilities were nationalized and this increased the state's wealth, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, but the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, bringing hardship when the price collapsed in the 1980s.  In foreign policy Algeria was a member and leader of the 'non-aligned' nations.  A dispute with Morocco over the [[Western Sahara]] nearly led to war.  Dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the media and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976.  Boum√©dienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open.  The state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to Algeria.  Village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased, new industries emerged, agriculture was substantially reduced, and education, a rarity in colonial times, was extended nationwide, raising the literacy rate from less than 10% to over 60%.  Improvements in healthcare led to a dramatic increase in the birthrate (7-8 children per mother) which had two consequences: a very youthful population, and a housing crisis.  The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: left-wingers, including Berber identity movements, and Islamic 'int√©gristes'.  Both protested against one-party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s.  Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Benjedid to concede the end of one-party rule, and elections were announced for 1991.

In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multiparty elections. The military then canceled the second round, forced then-president Bendjedid to resign, and banned the Islamic Salvation Front. The ensuing conflict engulfed Algeria in the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].  More than 100,000 people were killed, often in unprovoked massacres of civilians.  The question of who was responsible for these massacres remains controversial among academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]].  After 1998, the war waned, and by 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an amnesty program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas.  Elections resumed in 1995, and in 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the military, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was elected. The issue of Berber language and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]; the government responded with concessions including naming of [[Tamazight]] (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Algeria}}

The head of state is the [[President of Algeria|President of the republic]], who is elected to a 5-year term, renewable once. Algeria has [[universal suffrage]]. The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is bicameral, consisting of a lower chamber, the National People's Assembly (APN), with 380 members and an upper chamber, the Council of Nation, with 144 members. The APN is elected every 5 years.

Throughout the 1960's, Algeria supported many independence movements in sub-Saharan Africa, and was a leader in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. While it shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring [[Morocco]], the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other since Algeria's independence. This is due to two reasons: Morocco's [[Greater Morocco|claim to portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand war]] in 1963), and Algeria's support for the [[Polisario]], an armed group of [[Sahrawi]] [[refugee]]s seeking [[independence]] for the Moroccan-ruled [[Western Sahara]], which it hosts within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]]. Tensions between Algeria and Morocco, as well as issues relating to the [[Algerian Civil War]], have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Maghreb Arab Union]], nominally established in 1989 but with little practical weight, with its coastal neighbors.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Algeria}}

[[Image:Algeria map.png|220px|right|Map of Algeria with cities]]
[[Image:Hoggar3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ahaggar Mountains|Hoggar]] Mountains]]

Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are few good harbours. The area just south of the coast, known as the [[Tell]], is fertile. Further south is the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range and the [[Sahara]] desert. [[Algiers]], [[Oran]] and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] are the main cities.

Algeria's [[climate]] is arid and hot, although the coastal climate is mild, and the winters in the mountainous areas can be severe. Algeria is prone to [[sirocco]], a hot dust- and sand-laden wind especially common in summer.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Algeria}}

[[Image:Unknown origin coin2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Algerian coins]]
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves of [[natural gas]] in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks 14th in [[Petroleum]] reserves.

Algeria‚Äôs financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the IMF and debt rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria‚Äôs finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in oil prices and the government‚Äôs tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in foreign debt. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Algiers coast.jpg|thumb|[[Algiers]] coast]]
{{main|Demographics of Algeria}}

About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara desert]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic.

Ninety-nine percent of the population is classified ethnically as [[Arab]]/[[Berber]], and religiously as [[Muslim]]; other religions are restricted to extremely small groups, mainly of foreigners. Europeans account for less than 1%.

Most Algerians are Arab by language and identity, and of mixed Berber-Arab ancestry. The Berbers inhabited Algeria before the arrival of Arab tribes during the expansion of Islam, in the 7th century. The issue of ethnicity and language is sensitive after many years of government marginalization of Berber (or [[Amazigh]], as some prefer) culture. Today, the Arab-Berber issue is often a case of self-identification or identification through language and culture, rather than a racial or ethnic distinction. The 20% or so of the population who self-identify as Berbers, and primarily speak Berber languages (such as [[Tamazight]]), are divided into several ethnic groups, notably [[Kabyle]] (the largest) in the mountainous north-central area, [[Chaoui]] in the eastern [[Atlas Mountains]], [[Mozabite]]s in the [[M'zab]] valley, and [[Tuareg]] in the far south.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Algeria}}

The [[official language]] is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], spoken natively in dialectal form (&quot;[[Algerian Arabic|Darja]]&quot;) by some 80% of the population; the other 20% or so speak [[Berber]] ([[Tamazight]]), officially a [[national language]]. [[French language|French]] is the most widely studied foreign language (distantly followed by [[English language|English]]), but is very rare as a [[native language]]. Since independence, the government has pursued a policy of linguistic [[Arabization]] of education and bureaucracy, with some success, although many university courses continue to be taught in French.

==Culture==
[[Image:Algiers mosque.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque]] in Algiers]]
{{main|Culture of Algeria}}

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history.  [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]] and [[Kateb Yacine]], while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated.  Important novelists of the 1980s included [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.  As early as Roman times, [[Apuleius]], born in [[Mdaourouch]], was native to what would become Algeria.

In philosophy and the humanities, [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]], while [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (about 60 miles from the present day city of [[Annaba]]), and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.

Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion.  The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in precolonial times, and of Emir [[Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted.

The [[Music of Algeria|Algerian musical]] genre best known abroad is [[ra√Ø]], a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] and [[Cheb Mami]].  However, in Algeria itself the older, highly verbal [[chaabi]] style remains more popular, with such stars as [[El Hadj El Anka]] or [[Dahmane El Harrachi]], while the tuneful melodies of [[Kabyle]] music, exemplified by [[Idir]], [[Ait Menguellet]], or [[Loun√®s Matoub]], have a wide audience.  For more classical tastes, [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusi music]], brought from [[Al-Andalus]] by [[Morisco]] refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns.

In painting, [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[M'hemed Issiakhem]] are notable in recent years.

{{spoiler}}

==Balph Eubank==
Called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he is incapable of writing anything that people actually want to read. What people ''want'' to read, he says, is irrelevant. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies. He is a member of the ''Looters''. Balph Eubank appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==Ben Nealy==
A railroad contractor whom ''Dagny Taggart'' hires to replace the track on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Rio Norte Line|Rio Norte Line]] with [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged#Rearden Metal|Rearden Metal]]. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement, and this is manifest in his inability to organize the project and to make decisions. He relies on Dagny and ''Ellis Wyatt'' to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around. Ben Nealy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Bertram Scudder==
Editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on ''Hank Rearden'' called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Equalization of Opportunity Bill|Equalization of Opportunity Bill]]. Bertram Scudder appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Betty Pope==
A wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with ''James Taggart'' that coincides with the overall meaninglessness of her life. She regrets having to wake up every morning because she has to face another empty day. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position. Betty Pope appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 142 and 161.
==Brakeman==
An unnamed employee working on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Comet|Taggart Comet]] train. ''Dagny Taggart'' hears Brakeman whistling the theme of a concerto. When she asks him what piece it is from, he says it is [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Halley's Fifth Concerto|Halley's Fifth Concerto]]. When Dagny points out that ''Richard Halley'' only wrote four concertos, Brakeman claims he made a mistake and he doesn't recall where he heard the piece.

Later, after Dagny instructs the train crew how to proceed, he asks a co-worker who she is, and learns she is the one who runs [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]].

It is later discovered that the unknown brakeman is one of the strikers, when Dagny meets him in the valley. Brakeman appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 113.

==Cherryl Brooks==
Dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. She is horrible to Dagny until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that she married Jim, thinking she was marrying Dagny. Like Eddie Willers, Cherryl is one representation of a &quot;good&quot; person who lacks the extraordinary capacities of the primary heroes of the novel.

==Claude Slagenhop==
The president of political organization [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Friends of Global Progress]] (which is supported by ''Philip Rearden''), and one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. He is not bothered by the fact that action unguided by ideas is random and pointless. Global Progress is a sponsor of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Equalization of Opportunity Bill]]. Claude Slagenhop appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==Cuffy Meigs==
A looter who's assigned by Wesley Mouch to keep watch over the workings of ''Taggart Transcontinental,'' and later assumes control over the company after Dagny Taggart leaves. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, he dresses in a military uniform. The &quot;intellectual heir&quot; of Dr. Robert Stadler, Meigs comes to a fitting end at the hands of ''Project X.''

==Dagny Taggart==
The main character in Atlas Shrugged (also the name of her namesake ''Mrs. Nathaniel Taggart''). Dagny is Vice-President in Charge of Operation at Taggart Transcontinental.  She is the female hero, the counterpart to John Galt, her journey is the journey of the reader exploring and understanding Galts philosophy. Those in the know understand that she is the one who really runs the railroad. In the course of the novel, she forms romantic liaisons with three men of ability. Francisco, Hank Rearden and John Galt in order. John is the one who, because of the sum-total of his qualities, will become the choice of Dagny. Dagny appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 113, 114, 132, 133, 141, 145, 146, 147, 148, 151, 152, and 161.

==Dan Conway==
The middle-aged president of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Phoenix-Durango]] railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]] is used to drive his business out of [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing. He claims that somebody had to be sacrificed, it turned out to be him, and he has no right to complain, bowing to the will of the majority. When pressed he says he doesn't really believe this is right, but he can't understand why it is wrong and what the alternative might be. He is trapped by a moral code that makes him a willing victim, and rather than challenge that morality, he simply gives up. Dan Conway appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 145 and 146, and is mentioned in section 148.
==Dick McNamara==
A contractor who finished the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]] and who is hired to lay the new [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] track for the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]]. Before he gets a chance to do so, he mysteriously disappears. Dick McNamara is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 133 and 141.
==Eddie Willers==
Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operation at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with ''Dagny Taggart''. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]]. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the promethian creative ability of The Strikers, but nevertheless matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. Eddie Willers appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 117, 132, 133, 141, 151, and 152.

==Ellis Wyatt==
The head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt Oil]]. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]] by discovering oil there. Of all the disappearances of industrialists in the novel, Wyatt's, involving the fiery destruction of his oil wells, is surely the most dramatic. Ellis Wyatt is mentioned or appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 132, 146, 147, 148, and 152.

==Francisco d'Anconia==
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. By all accounts, he is a worthless millionaire playboy, owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire, the man behind the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]], and a childhood friend and first love of ''Dagny Taggart''.

Francisco began working on the sly as a teenager in order to learn all he could about business. While still a student at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]], he began working at a copper foundry, and investing in the stock market. By the time he was twenty he had made enough to purchase the foundry. He began working for [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|d'Anconia Copper]] as assistant superintendent of a mine in Montana, but was quickly promoted to head of the New York office. He took over d'Anconia Copper at age 23, after the death of his father.

When he was 26, Francisco secretly joined the ''Strikers'' and began to slowly destroy the d'Anconia empire so the ''Looters'' could not get it. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia.

''According to [mailto:areed2@calstatela.edu Adam Reed] ([http://www.monmouth.com/~adamreed/Ayn_Rands_jewish_years/Who_is_Francisco_DAnconia.html Who is Francisco D'Anconia?]), d'Anconia is the only Hero-class character who is recognizably Jewish (not in the religious, but in the historical sense, like Ayn Rand herself).'' Francisco D'Anconia appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 132, 141, 144, 151, and 152 - this last section includes a detailed history of his life.
==Hank Rearden==
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. He is the founder of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Steel]] and the inventor of [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]]. He lives in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] with his wife ''Lillian'', his brother ''Philip'', and an elderly woman known only as ''Rearden's Mother'', all of whom he supports. [[Gwen Ives]] is his secretary.

The character of Hank Rearden has two important roles to play in the novel. First, he is in the same position as the reader in that he is aware that there is something wrong with the world but is not sure what it is. Rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with ''Francisco d'Anconia'', who does know the secret, and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in [[Atlas Shrugged/Galts Speech|Galt's Speech]]. 

Second, Rearden is used to illustrate Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged|theory of sex]]. ''Lillian Rearden'' cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. ''Dagny Taggart'' clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire. Rearden is torn by a contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, while responding sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates Rand's sexual theory. Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, 147, and 161, and is mentioned in sections 114 and 131.

==Hugh Akston==
Identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]], where he taught ''Francisco d'Anconia'', ''John Galt'', and ''Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld''. He was, along with ''Robert Stadler'', a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. Hugh Akston is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==James Taggart==
The President of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] and a leader of the ''Looters''. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is incapable of making decisions on his own. He relies on his sister ''Dagny Taggart'' to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the Looters is revealed: it is a code of [[nihilism]]. The goal of this code is to not exist, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretence that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. James Taggart appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 143, 144, 152 and 161, and is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 146 and 148.

==John Galt==
*The question &quot;[[Who is John Galt?]]&quot; is asked repeatedly throughout [[Atlas Shrugged]]. Late into the book we learn that '''John Galt''' is the man who stopped the motor of the world and the leader of the ''Strikers''. He is also the same character as the '''Mystery Worker'''.

The son of an [[Ohio]] garage mechanic, Galt left home at age 12 and began college at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] at age 16. There he befriended [[#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] and [[#Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld|Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld]], all three of whom double-majored in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]]. They were the cherished students of the brilliant scientist [[#Robert Stadler|Robert Stadler]] and the brilliant philosopher [[#Hugh Akston|Hugh Akston]].

After graduating, Galt became an [[engineer]] at the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Twentieth Century Motor Works]] where he designed a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity with the potential to change the world. Like [[#Ellis Wyatt|Ellis Wyatt]], he has created what many had for years said was impossible. When the company owners decided to run the factory by the collectivist maxim, 'By each according to his ability, to each according to his need', Galt organized a successful [[labor strike]], proclaiming his promise to stop the motor of the world.  He began traversing the globe, meeting the world's most successful businessmen, systematically convincing them to follow in his footsteps; one by one, they began abandoning their business empires (which, Galt convinced them, were doomed to failure anyhow, given the increased nationalization of industry by the government).

Secretly, these captains of industry, led by Galt and [[banker]] [[#Midas Mulligan|Midas Mulligan]], had created their own society &amp;mdash; a secret enclave of rational individualists living in &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]]&quot;, a town secluded high in a wilderness of mountains.  [[#Dagny Taggert|Dagny]] accidentally finds the town &amp;mdash; and a shocked John Galt &amp;mdash; by crash-landing a light [[aircraft]] while pursuing [[#Quentin Daniels|Quentin Daniels]].

Since everyone across the country is repeating the phrase, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is natural that many people have attempted to answer that question. The phrase becomes an expression of helplessness and despair at the current state of the world. ''Dagny Taggart'' hears a number of [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#John Galt Legends|John Galt Legends]] before finding the real John Galt and eventually joining his cause, and learning that all of the stories have an element of truth to them.

:''There is a clothing store in [[Vail, Colorado]] called John Galt Ltd. One presumes that, on occasion, a customer unknowingly walks in and asks, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;''

==Lillian Rearden==
The wildly unsupportive wife of ''Hank Rearden''. They have been married eight years as the novel begins.

Lillian is a frigid ''Moocher'' who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be greviously wasted.

Lillian also serves to illustrate Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged|Theory of sex]]. She believes sex is a base animal instinct and that sexual indulgence is a sign of moral weakness. She is incapable of feeling this kind of desire, which she believes testifies to her moral superiority. However, according to the theory of sex Lillian's lack of sexual capacity results from her inability to experience value in herself; she is therefore unable to respond sexually when she experiences value in others.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161 she indicates that she abhors ''Francisco d'Anconia'', because she believes he is a sexual adventurer. Lillian Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==The Looters==
A group of evil characters sometimes referred to as &quot;James Taggart and his friends&quot;. They are similar to the Moochers. The Looters consist of men and women who use force to obtain value from those who produce it. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Looters include: Mr. Thompson, Balph Eubank, Floyd Ferris, James Taggart, Orren Boyle, Paul Larkin, Robert Stadler, Simon Pritchett, Wesley Mouch, and Cuffy Miegs. 
==Midas Mulligan==
A wealthy banker who mysteriously disappears in protest after he is given a court order to loan money to an incompetent loan applicant. Midas Mulligan is responsible for the creation and distribution of the money that is exclusively used in Galt's Gulch, and is the original owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located. He is also responsible for the production of the money used there.
==The Moochers==
A group of characters, similar to the ''Looters'', who use guilt as a weapon against those who produce value. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Moochers include ''Lillian Rearden'', ''Philip Rearden'', and Hank Rearden's ''mother''.

==Mort Liddy==
A [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies that no one listens to. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends and a member of the cultural elite. Mort Liddy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Mr. Mowen==
The president of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc.]] of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. He is unable to grapple with abstract issues, and is frightened of anything controversial. Dagny Taggart hires Mr. Mowen to produce switches made of [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]]. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be ridden and cajoled before he is willing to accept the contract.  When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source. Mr. Mowen appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Mystery Worker==
A menial worker for [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] who often dines with ''Eddie Willers'' in the employee's cafeteria. Eddie finds him very easy to talk to, and Mystery Worker not-so-subtly leads him on so that Eddie reveals important information about ''Dagny Taggart'' and Taggart Transcontinental. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on, and with remarkable consistency, those are the next men to disappear mysteriously. Mystery Worker is actually John Galt. Mystery Worker appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 133.

==The unnamed newsstand owner==
He works in the Taggart Terminal. Twenty years ago he owned a cigarette factory but it went under, and he's been working at his newsstand ever since. He is a collector of cigarettes, and knows every brand ever made. He occasionally chats with ''Dagny Taggart'' when she comes by. On one occasion, in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 132, after Dagny asks him about his collection, he bemoans the fact that there are no new brands and the old brands are all disappearing. He examines a cigarette given to Dagny by ''Hugh Akston'', but it is a new brand that he has never seen before. It carries the sign of the dollar. In his first appearance, the Newsstand Owner likens the fire of a cigarette to the fire of the mind. This alludes to the Greek myth of Prometheus, who gave mankind the gift of fire, allowing it to raise itself up and become civilized. In [[Atlas Shrugged]], it is the mind of man that raises mankind. Thus the cigarettes become symbolic of the men of the mind. The disappearance of the old brands represents the disappearance of the men of the mind, and the Newsstand Owner's discovery of the new brand foreshadows Dagny's discovery of a new kind of men of the mind.

==Orren Boyle==
The head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Associated Steel]] and a friend of ''James Taggart''. He is one of the ''Looters''. He is an investor in the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]]. Orren Boyle appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 144, and 152.
==Owen Kellogg==
Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]]. He catches ''Dagny Taggart's'' eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division she decides to make him to its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]], Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. He admits that he loves his work, but that's not enough to keep him. He won't say why he is leaving or what he will do. Later, he is noticed working as transient labor by the unsuccessful/unmotivated businessman ''Mr. Mowen''. Owen Kellog eventually reaches, and settles in Atlantis. Owen Kellogg appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 114.

==Paul Larkin==
An unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family, and a member of the ''Looters''. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121 Larkin visits [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] to warn ''Hank Rearden'' of possible trouble from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Washington]]. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 he meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them. Paul Larkin appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, and 2A1.
==Philip Rearden==
The younger brother of ''Hank Rearden'', and a ''Moocher''. He lives in his brother's home in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] and is completely dependent on him. He believes that the source of his sustenance is evil and would love to see him destroyed. He has never had a career and spends his time perfunctorily working for various social groups.
He becomes resentful of his brother's charity. He then requests that he be granted a job from his brother because he should not have to be burdened by the feeling of inadequacy of not earning his own livelihood. When confronted by his brother on how this job should be a mutually beneficial arrangement, Philip shrugs the argument off as irrelevant and that the job should be entitled to him solely based on his need for money and the fact of familial ties. Philip Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==Quentin Daniels==
An enterprising engineer hired by ''Dagny Taggart'' to reconstruct ''John Galt's'' motor.  Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had.  Dagny sets out to meet Quentin in hopes of convincing him to resume his work.  John Galt narrowly gets to him first.  Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]]&quot;

==Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld==
One of the original ''Strikers''. He is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar was from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Norway]], the son of a bishop and the scion of one of Norway's most ancient, noble families. He attended [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]] and became friends with ''John Galt'' and ''Francisco d'Anconia'', while studying under ''Hugh Akston'' and ''Robert Stadler''.

Ragnar seizes relief ships that are being sent from the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|United States]] to [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Europe]]. No one knows what he does with the goods he seizes. As the novel progresses, Ragnar begins, for the first time, to become active in American waters, and is even spotted in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Delaware Bay]]. Reportedly, his ship is better than any available in the fleets of the world's navies. 

When he became a pirate, he was disowned and excommunicated. There is a price on his head in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Norway]], [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Portugal]], [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Turkey]]. 

According to Ayn Rand (verbal report), his name is a tribute to Victor Hugo.  In Hugo's first novel, ''Hans of Iceland'', the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskj√∂ld.  His name may be a pun on 'Dane's Gold', although &quot;skj√∂ld&quot; means shield, not gold. Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Rearden's mother==
Named Gertrude, she is a ''Moocher'' who lives with her son ''Hank Rearden'' at his home in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]]. She is involved in church-based charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She insults him by saying he was always selfish, even as a child. She dotes on her weak son ''Philip Rearden''. Rearden's mother appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Richard Halley==
Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141 we learn that Richard Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24 his opera ''Phaethon'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. (It was based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] in which [[Phaethon]] steals his father's chariot, and dies in an audacious attempt to drive the sun across the sky. Halley changed the story, though, into one of triumph, in which Phaethon succeeds.) For years Halley wrote in obscurity. After nineteen years, ''Phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. It appears his critics felt he had paid his dues long enough that he was at last worthy of their approval. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. Richard Halley is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 114, 133, and 141, and appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.
==Dr. Robert Stadler==
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to ''Francisco d'Anconia'', ''John Galt'' and ''Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld''. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: ''Project X.''
==Dr. Simon Pritchett==
The prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]] and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He is also a ''Looter''. He is certainly representative of the philosophy of the age - he is a crude reductionist who believes man is nothing but a collection of chemicals; he believes there are no standards, that definitions are fluid, reason is a superstition, that it is futile to seek meaning in life, and that the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood. He explains all this in his book ''The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe'', and at cocktail parties. Dr. Pritchett appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==The Strikers==
People of the mind who go on strike because they do not appreciate being exploited by ''the Looters'' and demonized by a society who depends on them for its very existence. The leader of the Strikers is ''John Galt''. Other Strikers include: Hugh Akston, Francisco d'Anconia, Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld, Richard Halley, and the Brakeman. Characters who join the Strikers in the course of the book include: Dagny Taggart, Ellis Wyatt, Hank Rearden, Dick McNamara, and Owen Kellogg.
==Mr. Thompson==
The &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]],&quot; which essentially means that he's the [[President of the United States]], though he's never specifically referred to as such. In the world of ''Atlas Shrugged'' all Presidents and Prime Ministers are referred to simply as &quot;Head of the State&quot; and &quot;Mr. ____.&quot; This is because countries have been standardized as &quot;People's States&quot; which seem to share a common form of government. Thomspon's title can thus be seen as reflecting the fact that the US is in the process of evolving into one of these &quot;People's States.&quot; One of the Looters, he's not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modelled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]].

==Wesley Mouch==
A member of the ''Looters'' and, at the beginning of the storyline, the incompetent lobbyist whom ''Hank Rearden'' reluctantly employs in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Washington]]. Initially Wesley Mouch is the least powerful and least significant of the Looters - the other members of this group feel they can look down upon him with impunity. Eventually he becomes the most powerful Looter, and the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|country's]] economic dictator, thereby illustrating Rand's belief that a government-run economy places too much power in the hands of incompetent bureaucrats who would never have positions of similar influence in a private sector business. Wesley Mouch appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 and is mentioned in section 161.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technology in Atlas Shrugged''', [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel includes a variety of technological products and devices.  In addition to real world technology ([[aircraft]], [[automobile]]s, [[diesel engine]]s, [[phonograph record]]s, [[radio]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[television]], and [[traffic signals]]) [[Atlas Shrugged]] also includes various fictional technologies or fictional variants on real inventions.

{{spoilers}}

==Fictional technology==
Fictional inventions mentioned in the book include refractor rays (Gulch mirage), Rearden Metal, a sonic [[death ray]] (&quot;Project X&quot;), voice activated door locks (Gulch power station), motors powered by [[static electricity]], palm-activated door locks (Galt's NY lab), shale-oil drilling, and a [[nerve]]-induction [[torture]] machine.
 
===Traffic Signals===
Early on, the book mentions the &quot;screech&quot; of a traffic signal as it changes. This implies the older technology of mechanical traffic signals, the kind which displayed a pennant or flag indicating stop or go, and the inverse indicator in the opposite direction. Traffic signals using lights have been around for over 40 years, so anything of this type is very old compared to today.

===Project X===
Project X is an invention of the scientists at the state science institute, requiring tons of Rearden Metal. Basically, it is a &quot;death ray&quot;, and is capable of destroying anything. The scientists claim that the project will be used to preserve peace and squash rebellion. It is destroyed towards the end of the book, and emits a pulse of radiation that destroys everything in the surrounding area, including Cuffy Meigs and Dr. Stadler, as well as the Taggart Bridge.

===Rearden Metal===
Rearden metal is a [[Fictional_chemical_substance#Fictional_compounds_and_alloys|fictitious metal]] alloy invented by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]].  It is lighter than traditional [[steel]] but stronger, and is to steel what steel was to [[iron]].  It is described as greenish-blue.  Among its ingredients are iron and [[copper]].

Initially no one is willing to use Rearden metal because no one wants to stick his neck out and be the first to try it.  Finally, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] places an order for Rearden Metal when she needs rails to rebuild the dying [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].

The first thing made from Rearden metal is a [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|bracelet]].

Rearden metal is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 114, 121, 131, 148 and 161.

===Galt's Motor===
John Galt invented a new type of electrical apparatus described in the book as a [[motor]].  However, it does not operate like a motor in the common use of the word today:  it is capable of harnessing, transforming and applying energy in many ways other than mechanical.  Galt's Motor was capable of [[Radio jamming|jamming]] all [[radio receiver]]s on Earth, and completely destroying the contents of Galt's [[booby-trap]]ped laboratory without causing [[collateral damage|collateral structural damage]].


Though Rand describes it as turning [[static electricity ]] into useful [[mechanical work]], its operation is more reminiscent of modern speculation about [[zero-point energy]].

Dagny discovers a discarded prototype of the motor and it is superficially described in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] Part 1, Chapter 9.  Galt shows Dagny the motor and describes it in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] Part 3, Chapter 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Companies in Atlas Shrugged''', the [[Ayn Rand]] [[novel]], generally, are  divided into two groups, these that are operated by sympathetic characters are given the name of the owner, while companies operated by evil or incompetent characters are given generic names.  In [[Atlas Shrugged]] men who give their names to their companies all become [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Strikers]] in due time.

==Amalgamated Switch and Signal==
A company run by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Mr. Mowen]] and located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Connecticut]].  They have supplied Taggart Transcontinental for generations.  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] orders [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] switches from them.

Amalgamated Switch and Signal appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Associated Steel==
Associated Steel is the company owned by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Orren Boyle]].  The company was started with just a few hundred-thousand dollars of [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Boyle's]] own money, and hundreds of millions of dollars in government grants.  Boyle used this money to buy out his competitors, and now relies on influence peddling and political favors to run his business.

Associated Steel is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131 and 171.

==Ayers Music Publishing Company==
Ayers Music Publishing Company is the publisher of the music of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Richard Halley]].  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] contacts [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Mr. Ayers]] to inquire as to the existence of [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Halley's Fifth Concerto]].

Ayers Music Publishing Company is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 114.

==Barton and Jones==
The company, located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Denver]], that supplies food for the workers rebuilding the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].  They go bankrupt in the middle of the project.

Barton and James is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==d'Anconia Copper==
A copper and mining company founded by [[Minor Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Sebastian d'Anconia]] in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Argentina]] during the time of the Inquisition.  Each man who ran the company saw it grow by 10% in his lifetime, so by the time [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Francisco d'Anconia]] heads the company it is the largest in the world.  His dream, from childhood, is to increase the size of the company by 100%.

d'Anconia Copper is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 152 and 171.

==Hammond Motors==
A car company in Colorado.  They make the best cars on the market until the founder disappears.

[[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] buys a Hammond on his trip to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Incorporated Tool==
A company that is contracted to deliver drill heads to Taggart Transcontinental but who fail to do this.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Phoenix-Durango==
The Phoenix-Durango is an old, small railroad located in the Southwest run by  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dan Conway]] that has been insignificant for most of its existence.  However, the Phoenix-Durango grows rapidly when [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]] revives the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] and Taggart Transcontinental's [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] fails to service Wyatt adequately.  Later, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] conspires to get the Phoenix-Durango driven out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] with the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]].

The Phoenix-Durango is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131 (alluded to), 132, 145, 146, 147 and 152.

==Rearden Coal==
A business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] prior to the founding of Rearden Steel.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Rearden Limestone==
A business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] prior to the founding of Rearden Steel.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Rearden Ore==
The first business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]].  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Rearden Steel==
A company founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] about ten years prior to the start of the story in the novel.  Rearden bought an abandoned steel mill in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Philadelphia]] at a time when all the experts thought that such a venture would be hopeless.  He turned it into the most reliable and profitable steel company in the country.

As [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] struggles to save Taggart Transcontinental, she becomes increasingly dependent on Rearden Steel.

Rearden Steel is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 121, 131 (alluded to), 161 and 162.

==Summit Casting==
A company in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Illinois]] under contract to deliver rail spikes to Taggart Transcontinental.  They go bankrupt before they can deliver, prompting [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] to fly to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Chicago]] and buy the company to get it started again.

Summit Casting is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Taggart Transcontinental==
The fictional [[railroad]] run by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]].  Her commitment to the railroad creates one of the book's major conflicts.

Taggart Transcontinental was founded by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Nathaniel Taggart]] who lived three generations (or so) prior to Dagny's generation.  It was built without any grants, loans, or favors from the government, and was the last railroad that was still owned and controlled by its founder's descendants.  Its motto is, ''From Ocean to Ocean''.

The 'flagship' of Taggart Transcontinental is the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Comet]] which runs from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]] to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|San Francisco]], and which has never been late.

==United Locomotive Works==
An incompetent company that is supposed to deliver Diesel engines to Taggart Transcontinental. The order is delayed in perpetuity, and the [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|president]] of the company refuses to ever give a straight answer as to why this is so.

The United Locomotive Works is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 133 and 141.

==Wyatt Oil==
The oil company run by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]].  Wyatt's father had squeezed a living out of the oil fields in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], but when Ellis Wyatt took over the business took off.  He discovered a technique for extracting oil from wells that had been abandoned as dried up.  The success of Wyatt Oil that followed this discovery suddenly and unexpectedly turned [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] into the leading economy in the country.

Wyatt Oil traditionally relied on Taggart Transcontinental's [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] to ship its oil.  But when that company could not grow fast enough to keep up with the booming [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] economy, Wyatt started using the small but well-managed Phoenix-Durango instead.  This prompted [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] to make deals with his friends to drive the Phoenix-Durango out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]].  Afterwards, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] has to rebuild the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] so it can supply transportation to Wyatt Oil - if she fails, the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], and of the whole country, could collapse.

Wyatt Oil is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 132 and 171.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the important '''concepts''' discussed in [[Atlas Shrugged]] include  the ''Sanction of the Victim'' and the ''Theory of Sex''.

===Sanction of the Victim===

The Sanction of the Victim is defined as &quot;the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the [[evil]], to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the '[[sin]]' of creating values.&quot;

The entire story of Atlas Shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question, what would happen if this sanction was revoked?  When Atlas shrugs, relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world, he is revoking his sanction.

The concept is supposedly original in the thinking of [[Ayn Rand]] and is foundational to her moral theory.  She holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it.  To quote from [[Atlas_Shrugged/Galts Speech|Galt's Speech]]: &quot;Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us&quot;, and, &quot;I saw that evil was impotent...and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it.&quot;  Morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood, Rand claims.  In adhering to this concept, Rand assigns virtue to the trait of [[selfishness]].

Throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world but they cannot put their finger on what it is.  The concept they cannot grasp is the sanction of the victim.  The first person to grasp the concept is [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]], who vows to stop the motor of the world by getting the creators of the world to withhold their sanction.

We first glimpse the concept in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121 when [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] feels he is duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility towards him.

In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 146 the principle is stated explicitly by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dan Conway]]: &quot;I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain.&quot;

===Theory of Sex===

In rejecting the traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] altruist [[moral code]], Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is a [[logical implication]] of [[altruism]].

Rand introduces a theory of sex in ''Atlas Shrugged'' which is purportedly implied by her broader ethical and psychological theories.  Far from being a debasing animal instinct, sex is the highest celebration of our greatest values.  Sex is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values&amp;mdash;a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract.

One is sexually attracted to those who embody one's values.  Those who have base values will be attracted to baseness, to those who also have ignoble values.  Those who lack any clear purpose will find sex devoid of meaning.  People of high values will respond sexually to those who embody high values.

That our [[sexual desire]] is a response to the embodiment of our values in others is a radical and original theory.  However, even those who are sympathetic to this theory have criticized it as being incomplete.  For instance, since according to Rand the economy is also such an expression of values, and since it is always possible to encounter someone who embodies one's values more completely, this would seem to make [[family]] undesirable. (Indeed, Rand treats &quot;family&quot; as a sort of trap.) Furthermore, [[promiscuity]], [[prostitution]], and an endless [[round-robin]] of &quot;values-driven&quot; sexual relationships would become inevitable.  From this viewpoint, one could say that [[Aldous Huxley]] portrayed the ideal sexual state: ''[[Brave New World]]'' features humans who are incapable of deviating from their caste-oriented &quot;values&quot;, which naturally include a code of sexual desirability.

Her sexual theory is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] with [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Lillian Rearden]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]], and later with Dagny Taggart and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]].  

Other important illustrations of this theory are found in:

[[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|Section]] 152 - recounts Dagny's relationship with [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Francisco d'Anconia]].

[[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|Section]] 161 - recounts Hank and Lillian Rearden's courtship, and Lillian's attitude towards sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of general items in [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.

{{spoiler}}

==Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule==

The Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is passed by the National Alliance of Railroads in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 145, allegedly to prevent &quot;destructive competition&quot; between [[railroad]]s.  The rule gives the Alliance the authority to forbid competition between railroads in certain parts of the country.  It was crafted by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]] as a favor for [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]], with the purpose of driving the [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Phoenix-Durango|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged#Colorado|Colorado]].

==Bracelet==

The very first thing made from ''Rearden Metal'' is a bracelet.  The bracelet is used to illustrate Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged#Theory of Sex|Theory of Sex]].

The bracelet symbolizes the value created by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Hank Rearden|Hank Rearden's]] long struggle to invent Rearden Metal.  When he gives it to [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden]] as a present in section 121; she says, &quot;It's fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails.&quot;  However, Lillian fully grasps the significance of the gift; her snide remark is her way of denigrating her husband's ethos.

In section 161, Lillian wears this bracelet at a party thrown on her anniversary.  She makes fun of it all night long, and when [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] hears Lillian say she would gladly trade it for a common diamond bracelet, Dagny takes her up on it.

Lillian later asks for it back upon realizing her power over her husband was slowly diminishing.  Dagny denies the offer.

The bracelet appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==Cub Club==

A night club in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]].  When [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] returns to New York in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141, he explains he came because of a hat-check girl at the Cub Club and the liverwurst at Moe's Delicatessen on Third Avenue.

==Equalization of Opportunity Bill==

A bill designed by the [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Looters|Looters]] that proposes to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one.  It is aimed primarily at [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Hank Rearden|Hank Rearden]], who uses [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Rearden Ore|Rearden Ore]] to guarantee [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Rearden Steel|Rearden Steel]] with a supply of iron ore.  By passing this Bill, the Looters can seize Rearden's other businesses for themselves, and then deny him the iron he needs to run his steel mills.

The Looters claim the Bill is meant to give a chance to the little guy.

The Equalization of Opportunity Bill is appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Galt's Gulch==

A secluded refuge in a valley of Colorado where the men of ability have retreated after relinquishing participation in American society.  Nicknamed &quot;Galt's Gulch&quot; by its inhabitants, it is in fact the property of &quot;Midas&quot; Mulligan, one of the early strikers to follow John Galt's call. This call was to the great men of mind and action to abandon the increasingly slave-state inclinations of a decaying United States - to go on strike - thereby withdrawing the only thing supporting the parasites and looters.

Sarcastically nicknamed Midas in the press because everything he seemed to touch turned to gold, Mulligan adopted the nickname during his explosive investment career before dropping out of sight.  He had purchased this land among his far-ranging speculative endeavors, and subsequently retreated to it upon his disappearance.  Other strikers soon followed him there, including John Galt, renting or buying land for summer retreats as a respite from continuing their search for fellow strikers among the increasingly collapsing American society.  Eventually, a society develops in Galt's Gulch as more people live there year-round as the outside world becomes virtually unsafe to visit.

We are introduced to Galt's Gulch in the final section of the Novel, in the first chapter, entitled Atlantis.  The people live with each other in completely free society and embody everything which is the thesis of the Novel, the appropriate values for a society of Mankind: philosophical, moral, economic, legal, aesthetic, and sexual, among others too numerous to mention.

We find industrious, ambitious, happy people continuing their chosen fields of endeavor without the yokes of any taxation or regulation.  Conversely, there is a reverence for private property; everything transacted is paid for with the re-invented currency of solid gold coin struck from the reserves of Midas Mulligan's bank which now resides in the valley.  The townspeople receive services from the various heroes we have met throughout the Novel, who all now reside and produce in the valley. They purchase power inexpensively from Galt and his invention of the static electricity motor, maintain their anonymity from the outside world via Galt's invention of the air-wave reflection device (giving the view from above the camouflage of reflected images of other mountainsides nearby), and some attend Galt's lectures on Physics, where he explains his discoveries on new fundamental laws and applied mathematics.  The people purchase medical treatment from the care of Dr. Hendricks, who uses his invention of a portable [[X-ray]] machine to initially diagnose Dagny Taggart upon her crash landing into the valley, attend concerts of new musical compositions of Richard Halley who has continued to compose in the Valley, acquire raw materials from the efforts of Francisco D'Anconia's excavations around the valley, attend philosophy lectures from the now-retired pirate Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld, receive loans from Midas Mulligan, etc.

Rand's description of Galt's Gulch was inspired by a visit she and her husband Frank O'Connor took to [[Ouray, Colorado]] while researching Colorado for the novel.

==Halley's Fifth Concerto==

[[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Richard Halley|Richard Halley]] disappeared after he had written only four concertos.  In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 112, [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]], an enthusiastic fan of Halley's music, hears an unfamiliar theme being whistled by a [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Brakeman|brakeman]] on the Taggart Comet.  She asks him what it is; he responds Halley's Fifth Concerto.  When Dagny says Halley only wrote four concertos, the brakeman says he made a mistake and denies knowing what the song was.

Later, Dagny calls [[Minor characters in Atlas Shrugged|Mr. Ayers]] to find out if Halley wrote a fifth concerto. Ayers says Halley did not.

Halley's Fifth Concerto is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 114 and 152.

==Halley's Fourth Concerto==

The last thing [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Richard Halley|Richard Halley]] wrote before he disappeared.  It is a song of rebellion and defiance that seemed to say agony and suffering were not necessary.  [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] listened to this piece in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.

==''Heaven's In Your Backyard''==

A film.  [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Mort Liddy|Mort Liddy]] wrote the score, using a bastardized version of ''Halley's Fourth Concerto''.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==John Galt Legends==

Since everyone across the country is asking, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is not surprising that some people have come up with answers.  A number of John Galt Legends are told, each of which, ironically, turns out to be true, at least symbolically.

'''''Legend 1''''' ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161):  A [[Minor characters in Atlas Shrugged|spinster]] at [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden's]] party tells [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny]] the story.  John Galt was a man of inestimable wealth who found the sunken island of [[Atlantis]] while fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world.  The sight was so beautiful that, having seen it, he could never go back to the world, so he sank his ship and took his fortune down with him.

The actual John Galt was a man who created something of inestimable value, a new motor, and who discovered the secret to what was wrong with the world while fighting the most evil social philosophy ever put into practice.  The world he envisioned was so beautiful that he refused to live in the world that was, and disappeared, taking the secret of motor with him.

Atlantis, the Isles of the Blessed, is a place where no one could enter except those who had the spirit of a hero.  Described in these terms, it is the same as ''Galt's Gulch''.

==Moe's Delicatessen==

A delicatessen in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged#New York|New York]].  When [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] returns to New York in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141, he explains he came because of a hat-check girl at the ''Cub Club'' and the liverwurst at Moe's Delicatessen on Third Avenue.

==National Alliance of Railroads==

An industry group formed to promote the welfare of the industry as a whole, requiring members to sacrifice their individual interests for the common good.  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]] has friends on the National Alliance of Railroads, and he gets them to support the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule, which uses a string of pretenses to drive the [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Phoenix-Durango|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged#Colorado|Colorado]].

The National Alliance of Railroads is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 131, 145 and 146.

==National Council of Metal Industries==

An industry group that uses political pull to get its way. [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] has friends on the National Council of Metal Industries, and he gets them to support legislation that will hurt [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Rearden Steel|Rearden Steel]] and help [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Associated Steel|Associated Steel]].
 
The National Council of Metal Industries is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131.

==Patrick Henry University==

The most prestigious university in the world.  It was attended by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]], [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]], and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Ragnar_Danneskj.F6ld|Ragnar Danneskjold]], where they met and became friends.  [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Hugh Akston|Hugh Akston]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Robert Stadler|Robert Stadler]] taught there.  It is located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Cleveland]].

==Rio Norte Line==

A branch of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]] that runs from [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Cheyenne, Wyoming]] to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|El Paso, Texas]].

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131 (alluded to), 132, 133, 141, 146, 147 and 148.

==Rockdale Station==

A station on the [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]] line, located five miles from the Taggart estate and overlooking the [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Hudson River]].  It was the site of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart's]] first job with the railroad, night operator, at age 16.

It appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.

==San Sebastian==

A community built to house the workers of the ''San Sebastian Mines'' and their families.  As it turns out, the houses, roads, and everything of practical value is built so poorly that the community can be expected to fall apart within a year or two.  Only the church was built to last.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.

==San Sebastian Line==

A branch of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]] that serves the ''San Sebastian Mines'' in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]].

The mines were developed by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] and attracted significant investments from [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]], who assumed Francisco could be counted on to deliver a winner.

The San Sebastian Line is nationalized by the Mexican government soon after completion.

When it is nationalized in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 142, it is referred to as the San Sebastian Railroad.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 114, 131, 132, 133, 142, 143 and 152.

==San Sebastian Mines==

San Sebastian Mines is a copper mining project in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]] founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] and named after his ancestor [[Minor characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Sebastian d'Anconia]].  Francisco's reputation as a businessman is so great that investors flock to him, begging to invest money in the enterprise.  Investors include [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] and [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]]. Taggart goes so far as to build a new branch of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]], the ''San Sebastian Line'', to serve the mines, sinking $30 million into the project.  When the development of the mines appears complete, the Mexican government nationalizes them as well as the ''San Sebastian Line'', only to discover there is no copper and there never was.

When Taggart tells Francisco he considers the Mines a rotten swindle ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161), Francisco explains that Taggart should be pleased with the way he ran the mines.  He says he put into practice those moral precepts that were accepted around the world.  The world says it is evil to pursue a profit &amp;mdash; he got no profit from the worthless mines.  The world says the purpose of an enterprise is not to produce, but to give a livelihood to its employees &amp;mdash; it produced nothing, but created jobs that would never have existed if one was only concerned with developing a real mine.  The world says the owner is an exploiter and the workers do all the real work &amp;mdash; he left the enterprise entirely in the hands of the workers and did not burden anyone with his presence.  The world says need is more important than ability &amp;mdash; he hired a mining specialist who needed a job very badly, but had no ability.

In short, the San Sebastian Mines were an illustration of what happens when this moral code is put into practice, and a warning of what will soon happen to the world as a whole.

The San Sebastian Mines appear in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 131, 132, 142, 151, 152 and 161.

==Taggart Building==

A skyscraper in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]], the headquarters of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]], and the location of the Taggart Terminal.

==Taggart Comet==

The Taggart Comet is [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental's]] flagship train.  It runs from [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]] to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|San Francisco]], and has never been late.

The Taggart Comet appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 113 and 152.

==The Future==

See [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Bertram Scudder|Bertram Scudder]].

==''The Heart Is A Milkman''==

''The Heart is a Milkman'' is a novel being written by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Balph Eubank|Balph Eubank]].  It is about the central fact of human existence, frustration.  Eubank says he will dedicate it to [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden]].

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==The Octopus==

See [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Bertram Scudder|Bertram Scudder]].

==''The Vulture Is Molting''==

A best-selling novel that captures the spirit of the times, ''The Vulture Is Molting'' is &quot;A penetrating study of a businessman's greed.  A fearless revelation of man's depravity.&quot;  The book is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141 as one of the artifacts of [[popular culture]] that depresses [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] with its baseness.

==Wayne-Falkland Hotel==

A luxurious hotel in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]], it is considered the best hotel left in the world.  It is where [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] stays when he is in town.  It was also the scene of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart's]] debut ball when she was seventeen.

It may be based on the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.

The Wayne-Falkland Hotel is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 141, 151 and 152.

==Wyatt Oil Fields==

The Wyatt Oil Fields are in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]].  They are a bunch of old, abandoned oil wells that were revived by a new technique invented by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Ellis Wyatt|Ellis Wyatt]].  This has almost single-handedly revitalized the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]].

The Wyatt Oil Fields appear in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111 and 161.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Atlas===
As told in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', Atlas carried the world on his shoulders. But in the [[Greek Mythology|Greek Myths]], the Titan [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] stands on the earth and holds up the sky. In the statues that represent Atlas, the big round thing on his back represents the heavens, which, because of the apparent circular motion of the planets around the earth, were conceived of as being round. Some tellings of the Atlas myth have him carrying both the earth and the heavens on his back, but this appears to be a modern retelling; further research might confirm this.

===Character names===
Some of the character names are, or appear to be, puns, or have some other significance.  (See also [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged]].)
When asked why so many of her names have syllables with many hard consonants like dag, tag, den, stad, Rand said that she just liked those sounds.

*'''Ragnar Danneskjold''' - sounds like 'Dane's Gold', a tribute paid by the medieval English to the Vikings to bribe them into being peaceful.  (However, note &quot;skjold&quot; means shield, not gold.)  However, the hero of [[Victor Hugo]]'s first novel, ''Hans of Iceland'' becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskj√∂ld.  In the 1970's, Rand told Marsha Familaro Enright that her use of this name was not plagiarism because there really were Counts of Danneskj√∂ld.
*'''Robert Stadler''' - sounds like the German word for state, Staat. Dr. Stadler is a statist, in that he believes it appropriate and necessary for the state to fund scientific research.
*'''Francisco d'Anconia''' - Rand's husband was Frank O'Connor.
*'''John Galt''' - the name of a 19th century Scottish novelist, though this is apparently coincidental. Galt is close to 'Geld' and 'gold'. The name was probably used because it had to be such that it could become proverbial&amp;mdash;this would not be possible with a long, awkward name.
*'''Wesley Mouch''' - Mouch is exactly what his name sounds like, a mooch.  He has no real virtue or skill, but somehow becomes a powerful figure.

===Crime===
Common street crime is conspicuously absent in ''Atlas Shrugged''. Characters walk the streets with no thought of being mugged or attacked.

===Historical figures and events===
''Atlas Shrugged'' takes place in a world with a different history from our own, but there are some historical figures and events that are mentioned.

*[[Aristotle]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): Francisco d'Anconia wrote a thesis on the influence of Aristotle's theory of the Immovable Mover.
*[[Dark Ages]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161): Ragnar Danneskjold's piracy is likened to something out of the Dark Ages.
*[[Inquisition]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): Sebastian d'Anconia flees Spain to escape persecution under the Inquisition.
*[[Middle Ages]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161): It is said that Ragnar Danneskjold hides in the Norwegian fjords as the Vikings did in the Middle Ages.
*[[Nero]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): Francisco d'Anconia compares himself to the Emperor Nero.
*[[Patrick Henry]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): The [[eponym]] of Patrick Henry University.
*[[Vikings]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161): It is said that Ragnar Danneskjold hides in the Norwegian fjords as the Vikings did in the Middle Ages.

===Humor===
In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152, Francisco cracks that the Mexican government was promising a roast of pork every Sunday for every man, woman, child and abortion.

In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152, Francisco lists the various buildings constructed for the workers of the San Sebastian Mines, and notes how they are all poorly built and can be expected to collapse, except for the church. &quot;The church, I think, will stand. They'll need it,&quot; he quips. Since the other things are things of value&amp;mdash;houses, roads, etc.&amp;mdash;it is ironic that only the church was built to last; to Rand and her heroes, a church is of no real value.

Almost every nation in the world except the United States is referred to as &quot;The People's State of...&quot;, and they are all, apparently, the recipients of relief supplies from the United States. In conversation, people casually refer to them as &quot;The People's State of...&quot; rather than just, say, France or Norway. It is obvious that people would not refer to countries by their formal names in casual conversation&amp;mdash;we don't call Canada &quot;The Dominion of Canada&quot; or Germany &quot;The Federal Republic of Germany&quot;&amp;mdash;so by having her characters do this Rand is exercising her dry wit.

===Lying===
The sympathetic characters of ''Atlas Shrugged'' generally do not tell lies. With the following exceptions, even when they are clearly trying to conceal something, they do not rely on overt falsehood, even when it is obvious that they could do so without being found out.

*In section 112 Brakeman tells Dagny Taggart he does not recall the name of the song he was whistling or where he heard it.
*In section 141 Francisco d'Anconia tells the press he came to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]] because of a hat check girl and the liverwurst at [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Moe's Delicatessen]].
*In section 151 we learn Dagny Taggart once lied to her mother about a cut to her lip that Francisco had given her. This was the only lie she ever told.
*In section 152 Dagny Taggart asks Francisco if Richard Halley has written a fifth concerto. He is evasive and tells her that Halley has stopped writing. Is this a lie?
*In section 161, Hank Rearden tells Dagny that he was the one who invited Bertram Scudder to the Rearden's anniversary party. It was actually Lillian who invited him, and Rearden had been furious about it.
*In part 2/chapter 9, Eddie Willers tells Dagny Taggart that his hesitation and uncertainty is caused by the illegality of her directions.  In fact, Eddie was shocked by the evidence and thus realization of her affair with Hank Rearden.

===People's States===
Almost every nation that is mentioned, other than the [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|United States]], is referred to as a &quot;People's State&quot;. These include:

* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|England]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|France]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|India]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Norway]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Portugal]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Turkey]]

The leaders of these countries are given the title the &quot;Head of the People's State,&quot; and called &quot;Mr._____&quot; (or &quot;Senor&quot;____). The President of the United States is refered to as &quot;Mr. Thompson&quot; and called the &quot;Head of the State,&quot; which seems to imply the US is on its way to becoming a People's State as well. 

===Religion===
In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152 Francisco tells Dagny he named the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]] after his ancestor Sebastian d'Anconia, a man they both honor deeply. This, to Dagny, is blasphemy&amp;mdash;the only kind of blasphemy she understands.

===Social classes===
Rand is sometimes called an elitist. This claim is probably accurate if we allow for the fact that Rand had her own standard of eliteness&amp;mdash;throughout ''Atlas Shrugged'', virtue is equated with creative ability.  It is, however, worth noting that in ''Atlas Shrugged'', there are no characters with creative ability which do not function as [[author surrogate]] characters (most notably Dagny Taggart); conversely, all of the [[Straw man|characters]] which disagree with the author are unintelligent and creatively bankrupt, and usually actively destructive.  Compare to the real world, where scientists, inventors, artists and industrialists often have wildly varying and strongly conflicting desires and opinions.

Different social classes are represented among both the heroes and the villains of ''Atlas Shrugged''. Among the heroes, John Galt and Hank Rearden are from working class backgrounds, while Dagny Taggart and Francisco d'Anconia are from wealthy families. Among the villains, Fred Kinnan is from a working class background, while James Taggart and Betty Pope are from wealthy families.

'''''Atlas Shrugged''''' is a novel by Russian-born writer and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], first published in [[1957]] in the [[United States|USA]], and Rand's last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy.  Most regard ''Atlas Shrugged'' as Rand's most famous work, her ''tour de force'', and most [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivists]] hold it to be, objectively (as in factually), the greatest novel of all time. Its theme (as stated by Rand) is &quot;the importance of the individual's reasoning mind in human life.&quot;

It is a highly philosophical and [[allegory|allegorical]] story that deals with themes of Rand's own [[Objectivism]], though she was not yet known as a philosopher when it was written. Whether or not she had philosophical intentions, and to what extent or sense the novel is an allegory, are controversial subjects. In fact, the ideas behind the book, and their extremism, as well as its relative popularity have made it one of the most controversial novels of the [[20th century]]. It is also one of the [[List_of_longest_novels|longest novels]] ever written, totaling one-thousand pages or more (depending on the publication).

==Philosophy and writing==

The theme of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is that independent, rational thought is the motor that powers the world. In the book, &quot;men of the mind&quot; go on [[Strike action|strike]], allowing the collapse of what only they hold together &amp;#8212; a peaceful cohesiveness Rand claims that humans, particularly those whose productive work comes from mental effort, may create wherever forceful human interference is absent. Given no alternative, they remove themselves from the &quot;looters.&quot; The title is an analogy: the rational men, like the Greek God Atlas, hold the world on their shoulders; in the form of a strike, they have chosen to 'shrug.' The book is rooted in [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivism]], the philosophical system founded by Rand.

Rand suggests that society stagnates when independence and individual achievement are discouraged or demonized, and that, inversely, a society will become more prosperous as it allows, encourages, and rewards independence and individual achievement. Rand believed that independence flourishes to the extent that people are free, and that achievement is rewarded best when [[private property]] is respected strictly. She advocated [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire capitalism]] as the [[political system]] that is most consistent with these beliefs. These considerations make ''Atlas Shrugged'' a highly political book, especially in its portrayal of [[fascism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]], or indeed any form of state intervention in societal affairs, as fatally flawed. However, Rand claimed that it is not a ''fundamentally'' political book, but that the politics portrayed in the novel are a result of her attempt to display her image of the ideal man and the position of the human mind in society.

Rand argues that independence and individual achievement drive the world, and should be embraced. Her worldview requires a &quot;[[rationality|rational]]&quot; [[moral code]]. She disputes the notion that [[self-sacrifice]] is a virtue, and is similarly dismissive of human faith in a [[divinity|god]] or higher being. The book positions itself against [[Christianity]] specifically, often directly within the characters' dialogue.

== Setting ==

Exactly when ''Atlas Shrugged'' is meant to take place is kept deliberately vague. In [[Wikibooks:Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152, the population of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York City]] is given as 7 [[million]]. The historical New York City reached 7 million people in the [[1930s]], which might place the novel sometime after that. There are many early [[20th century]] technologies available, but the political situation is clearly different from actual history. One interpretation is that the novel takes place a hundred (or perhaps ''hundreds'') of years in the future, implying that since the world lapsed into its socialistic morass, a global-wide stagnation has occurred in technological growth, population growth, and indeed growth of ''any'' kind; the wars, economic depressions, and other events of the 20th century would be a distant memory to all but [[scholar]]s and [[academician]]s. This would be in line with Rand's ideas and commentary on other novels depicting utopian and dystopian societies. Furthermore, this is also in line with an excerpt from a 1964 interview with ''Playboy'' magazine in which Rand states &quot;What we have today is not a capitalist society, but a mixed economy -- that is, a mixture of freedom and controls, which, by the presently dominant trend, is moving toward dictatorship. The action in ''Atlas Shrugged'' takes place at a time when society has reached the stage of dictatorship. When and if this happens, that will be the time to go on strike, but not until then.&quot;, thus implying that her novel takes place at some point in the future. The concept of societal stagnation in the wake of collectivist systems is central to the plot of another of Rand's works, ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]''.

All countries outside the US have become, or become during the novel, &quot;People's States&quot;. There are many examples of early 20th century [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|technology]] in ''Atlas Shrugged'', but no post-war advances such as [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[helicopter]]s, or [[computer]]s. [[Jet plane]]s are mentioned briefly as being a relatively new technology. [[Television]] is a novelty that has yet to assume any cultural significance, while [[radio]] broadcasts are prominent. Though Rand does not use in the book many of the technological innovations available while she was writing, she introduces some advanced, fictional inventions (e.g., sound-based [[weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], torture devices, as well as power plants).

Most of the action in ''Atlas Shrugged'' occurs in the [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|United States]]. However, there are important events around the world, such as in the People's States of [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]], and [[piracy]] at sea.

==Plot==

A section by section analysis of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is available on [[Wikibooks:Atlas Shrugged|Wikibooks]].

The novel‚Äôs plot, split into three sections (though the story is coherent apart from these,) is extremely complex. The first two sections, and to some extent the last, follow Dagny Taggart, a no-nonsense railroad executive, and her attempt to keep the company alive despite the fact that society is falling towards collectivism/altruism/statism. All throughout the novel people repeat a platitude Dagny greatly resents: ‚ÄòWho is John Galt?‚Äô It is a reflection of their helplessness, as the saying means ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt ask important questions, because they don‚Äôt have answers.‚Äô 

The geniuses of the world seem to be disappearing, and the apparent decline of civilization is making it more and more difficult for her to sustain her life-long aspirations of running the trans-continental railroad, which has been in her family for several generations. She deals with other characters such as Hank Rearden, a self-made businessman of great integrity whose career is hindered by his false feelings of obligation towards his wife. Francisco d'Anconia, Dagny‚Äôs childhood friend, first love, and king of the copper industry, appears to have become a worthless playboy who is purposely destroying his business. 

As the novel progresses: the myths about the real John Galt, as well as Francisco d'Anconia‚Äôs actions, become more and more a reflection of the state of the culture, and seem to make more and more sense; and, Hank and Dagny begin to experience the futility of their attempts to survive in a society that hates them and those like them for their greatness. 

During their plight, Dagny and Hank find the remnants of a motor that turns atmospheric energy into kinetic energy, an astounding feat; they also find evidence that the minds (the ‚ÄòAtlases‚Äô) of the world are disappearing because of one particular ‚Äòdestroyer‚Äô taking them away. Dagny and Hank deal with the irrationalities and apparent contradictions of their atmosphere, and search for the creator of the motor as well as ‚Äòthe destroyer‚Äô who is draining the world of its prime movers, in an effort to secure their ability to live rational lives.

All of this leads to an elaborate action-based explanation and eventual climax, presenting an understanding of all of the issues explored, and breaking everything down into one basic conflict. The final parts of the novel involve a speech by the story's true protagonist, and a resolution concerning the fate of society. The question 'Who is John Galt' is also answered.

==Film adaptation==
Rights to the novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' were purchased by the Baldwin Entertainment Group in [[2003]] with the intent of producing a feature-length film. Company leader [[Howard Baldwin]] was quoted in September 2004 as saying &quot;...everything is on track and [the movie] hasn‚Äôt been held up one bit... I assure you that this will be a big movie and ''it will get made''.&quot; Two works of Rand's&amp;mdash;''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[We the Living]]''&amp;mdash;have been adapted into movies so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anthropology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ'', &quot;human&quot; or &quot;person&quot;) consists of the study of [[humanity]] (see genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'').  It is [[holism|holistic]] in two senses: it is concerned with all humans at all times and with all dimensions of humanity.  A primary trait that traditionally distinguished anthropology from other humanistic disciplines is an emphasis on cultural relativity, indepth examination of context, and cross cultural comparisons.  

In [[North America]], &quot;anthropology&quot; is traditionally divided into four sub-disciplines: 
* [[physical anthropology]] or [[biological anthropology]], which studies [[primatology|primate behavior]], [[human evolution]], [[osteology]], [[forensics]] and [[population genetics]]; 
* [[cultural anthropology]], (called [[social anthropology]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and now often known as [[socio-cultural anthropology]]).  Areas studied by cultural anthropologists include social networks, [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], social behavior, [[kinship]] patterns, law, politics, [[ideology]], religion, beliefs, patterns in production and consumption, exchange, socialization, gender, and other expressions of culture, with strong emphasis on the importance of [[fieldwork]] or participant-observation (i.e living among the social group being studied for an extended period of time); 
* [[linguistic anthropology]], which studies variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture; and
* [[archaeology]], that studies the material remains of human [[society|societies]]. Archaeology itself is normally treated as a separate (but related) field in the rest of the world, although closely related to the anthropological field of [[material culture]], which deals with physical objects created or used within a living or past group as mediums of understanding its cultural values.

More recently, some anthropology programs began dividing the field into two, one emphasizing the [[humanities]] and [[critical theory]], the other emphasizing the [[natural science]]s and [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

==Historical and institutional context==
:''Main Article: [[History of anthropology]]''
The anthropologist [[T J Brewer]] once characterized anthropology as the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences.  Understanding how anthropology developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.

Contemporary anthropologists claim a number of earlier thinkers as their forebearers and the discipline has several sources. However, anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior. Traditions of [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[romanticism|romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings - typically people living in European [[colonialism|colonies]]. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in Natural History Museums with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. This being said, curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form - by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. Early anthropology was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[polynesia|Polynesian]] migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance - although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify - and rank - human beings based on inherent biological difference.

In the twentieth century academic disciplines began to organize around three main domains. The &quot;[[sciences]]&quot; seeks to derive natural laws through reproducible and falsifiable experiments. The &quot;[[humanities]]&quot; reflected an attempt to study different national traditions, in the form of [[history]] and the [[art]]s, as an attempt to provide people in emerging nation-states with a sense of coherence. The &quot;[[social sciences]]&quot; emerged at this time as an attempt to develop scientific methods to address social phenomena, in an attempt to provide a universal basis for social knowledge. Anthropology does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured &quot;participant-observation&quot; ‚Äì and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: &quot;humankind,&quot; conceived of as a whole.  Crucial to this study is the concept &quot;culture,&quot; which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens ‚Äì and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]'' ‚Äì from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices.  Thus, &quot;culture&quot; not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains.  Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==Anthropology in the U.S.==
Anthropology in the United States was pioneered by staff of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology, such as John Wesley Powell and Frank Hamilton Cushing.  Academic Anthropology was established by [[Franz Boas]], who used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. Boasian anthropology was politically active and suspicious of research dictated by the U.S. government or wealthy patrons. It was also rigorously empirical and skeptical of over-generalizations and attempts to establish universal laws. Boas studied immigrant children in order to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable and that human conduct and behavior was the result of nurture rather than nature. 

Drawing on his German roots, he argued that the world was full of distinct 'cultures' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little 'civilization' they had. Boas felt that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations like those made in the [[natural science]]s were not possible. In doing so Boas fought discrimination against immigrants, African Americans, and Native North Americans. Many American anthropologists adopted Boas' agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular targets for anthropologists today.

Boas's first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. All of these scholars produced richly detailed studies which described Native North America. In doing so they provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages also helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook ''Anthropology'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material the urge to generalize grew. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up. While such works as ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' and ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]] and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

==Anthropology in Britain==
Whereas Boas picked his opponents to pieces through attention to detail, in Britain modern anthropology was formed by rejecting historical reconstruction in the name of a science of society that focused on analyzing how societies held together in the present.

The two most important names in this tradition were [[Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown]] and [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], both of whom released seminal works in 1922. Radcliffe-Brown's initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] was carried out in the old style, but after reading [[√âmile Durkheim]] he published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') which drew heavily on the French sociologist. Over time he developed an approach known as structural-functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. [[Bronislaw Malinowski|Malinowski]], on the other hand, advocated an unhyphenated 'functionalism' which examined how society functioned to meet individual needs. Malinowski is best known not for his theory, however, but for his detailed [[ethnography]] and advances in methodology. His classic ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' advocated getting 'the native's point of view' and an approach to field work that became standard in the field.

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's success stem from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions which furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for 'Social Anthropology' by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the post-war period a string of monographs and edited volumes appeared which cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology. Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]] and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi'' by [[Meyer Fortes]], while well known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems''.

==Anthropology in France==
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions. Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss was a member of [[√âmile Durkheim|Durkheim's]] [[Annee Sociologique]] group, and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states. In particular, Mauss's ''Essay on the Gift'' was to prove of enduring relevance in anthropological studies of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]].

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]] which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

Above all, however, it was [[Claude L√©vi-Strauss]] who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. In addition to the enormous influence his [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, L√©vi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Francoise Heritier]] who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally-funded research laboratories rather than academic departments in universities.

==Anthropology after World War Two==
Before [[World War II|WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. It was after the war that the two would blend to create a 'sociocultural' anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]] focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche - an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]]. [[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[George Dalton]] focused on how traditional [[economics]] ignored cultural and social factors. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated L√©vi-Strauss's structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of development in 1960s and 1970s, including [[cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis. Authors such as [[David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]; [[Marxism]] became a more and more popular theoretical approach in the discipline. By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

In the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''Europe and the People Without History'' - were central to the discipline. Books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became a popular topic, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again) who drew on [[Claude L√©vi-Strauss|L√©vi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. 

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author's methodology and cultural positioning, and its influence on their ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously. Currently anthropologists have begun to pay attention to globalization, medicine and biotechnology, indigenous rights, and the anthropology of Europe.

==Politics of anthropology==
Anthropology's traditional involvement with nonwestern cultures has involved it in politics in many different ways. 

Some political problems arise simply because anthropologists usually have more power than the people they study. Some have argued that the discipline is a form of colonialist theft in which the anthropologist gains power at the expense of subjects. The anthropologist, they argue, can gain yet more power by exploiting knowledge and artifacts of the people he studies while the people he studies gain nothing, or even lose, in the exchange. An example of this exploitative relationship can been seen in the collaboration in Africa prior to World War II of British anthropologists (such as Fortes) and colonial forces. More recently, there have been newfound concerns about bioprospecting, along with struggles for self-representation for native peoples and the repatriation of indigenous remains and material culture.

Other political controversies come from American anthropology's emphasis on cultural relativism and its long-standing antipathy to the concept of race. The development of [[sociobiology]] in the late 1960s was opposed by cultural anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]], who argued that these positions were reductive.  While authors such John Randal Baker continued to develop the biological concept of race into the 1970s, the rise of genetics has proven to be central to developments on this front. Recently, [[Kevin B. MacDonald]] criticized Boasian anthropology as part of a &quot;Jewish strategy to facilitate mass immigration and to weaken the West&quot; ([[The Culture of Critique]],2002). As genetics continues to advance as a science some anthropologists such as Luca [[Cavalli-Sforza]] have continued to transform and advance notions of race through the use of recent developments in genetics, such as tracing past migrations of peoples through their mitcochondial and Y-chromosomal DNA, and [[ancestry-informative marker]]s.

Finally, anthropology has a history of entanglement with government intelligence agencies and anti-war politics. Boas publicly objected to US participation in [[World War I]] and the collaboration of some anthropologists with US intelligence. In contrast, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the war effort in some form, including dozens who served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the Office of War Information. In the 1950s, the [[American Anthropological Association]] provided the [[CIA]] information on the area specialities of its members, and a number of anthropologists participated in the U.S. government's [[Operation Camelot]] during the war in Vietnam. At the same time, many other anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement and passed resolutions in the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) condemning anthropological involvement in covert operations. Anthropologists were also vocal in their opposition to the war in Iraq, although there was no consensus amongst practitioners of the discipline.  

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The British Association for Social Anthropology has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. For example, the British Association for Social Anthropology has condemned the [[CIA]]'s Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program[http://avenue.org/ngic/about_prisp.htm], which funds anthropology students at US universities in preparation for them to spy for the [[United States]] government. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;




Anthropology is the study of human diversity--diversity of body and behavior, in the past and present.  Anthropology consists of four subfields or subdisciplines:

'''Physical anthropology'''--studies the diversity of the human body in the past and present. It includes how we acquired the structure of our body over time, that is human evolution, as well as differences and relationships between human populations today and their adaptations to their local environments.  It also sometimes includes the evolution and diversity of our nearest relatives, the primates (apes and monkeys).

'''Cultural anthropology'''--studies the diversity of human behavior in the present.  This is what most anthropologists do and what most of the public sees when they look at &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine or the &quot;Discovery&quot; channel on TV.  Cultural anthropologists travel to foreign societies (although it is possible to do anthropology on your own society!), live among the people there, and try as much as they can to understand how those people live.

'''Archaeology'''--studies the diversity of human behavior in the past.  Since it studies how people lived in the past, these people are not available for us to visit and talk to...or at least, not people who are currently living in the same way that their ancestors did in the past.  Therefore, archaeologists must depend on the artifacts and features that the people produced in the past and attempt to reconstruct their vanished way of life from the remnants of their culture.

'''Linguistic anthropology'''--studies the diversity of human language in the past and present.  While language is naturally a part of culture, it is such a huge topic that anthropologists have separated it into its own area of study.  Linguistic anthropologists are concerned about the development of languages, perhaps even back to the first forms of language, and how language changes over time.  They are also interested in how different contemporary languages differ today, how they are related, and how we can learn about things like migration and diffusion from that data.  They also ask how language is related to and reflects on other aspects of culture.

Other sciences study humans too, of course.  History, economics, psychology, sociology, even biology and chemistry can study humans. How is anthropology different?

The answer is the anthropological perspective, that is, the way that anthropology approaches the subject and thinks about or studies humans and their behavior.  The anthropological perspective has three components:

(1) Cross-cultural or comparative--anthropology investigates humans in every form that they take.  We are interested to see the entire spectrum of human bodies and behaviors, trying to learn the range of humanity--all the ways that we can be human.  By seeing humans in their every manifestation, and comparing those manifestations to each other, we can ask what is possible for humans and what is necessary for humans.

(2) Holistic--anthropology tries to relate every part of culture to every other part.  It understands that the various parts of culture are connected to each other and that certain combinations tend to occur or not to occur (for example, there are no hunting and gathering cultures that traditionally lived in cities...that's just impossible!).  We are also interested in how a people's cultures is connected to their environment; again, without high technology, you are not going to see farming or cities in the middle of the desert or the arctic.

(3) Relativistic--this is the most profound yet controversial part of the anthropological perspective.  Relativism means that the rules or norms or values of a culture are relative to that specific culture.  In other words, say, monogamy may be normal or preferred in one culture, but polygamy may be normal or preferred in another.  The point is that different cultures believe different things or value different things or even mean different things with perhaps identical-looking behaviors or objects. 

When you go to another culture, or even just interact with another culture (for example, when you are doing international business), you cannot assume that other people understand things the same way you do.  In fact, you should assume that they don't! Anthropology counsels against hasty judgement of a new culture: aspects that a Western visitor may find strange or distasteful can be understood when situated within that culture's history and cosmology (understanding of the world). There will be a rationality for the phenomenon; it may be 'rational', however, according to a cultural logic that conflicts with Western understandings.  Malinowski's primacy of seeking to understand &quot;the native point of view&quot; remains fundamental to socio-cultural anthropology today.

The point is that, if we want to understand other people properly, we must see what their behaviors or words or concepts mean to them, not what they would mean to us. Meaning is relative to the culture that creates that meaning.  This is not to say that all things are true or even that all things are good - cultural relativism does not necessarily entail moral relativism. Indeed, the American Anthropological Association's qualified support (1948; 1997) for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as work by Sally Engle Merry, shows the latter is not a common anthropological point of view.

How does anthropology study culture?

One other way that anthropology is unique among the sciences that study humans is by its emphasis on 'fieldwork'  You cannot get to know another culture just by reading about it or watching movies about it.  At best, you could learn what other people have already discovered, but you could not learn anything new.  So anthropology requires actually going to that society and living within their culture as much as possible.  This is called [[Participant observation|participant observation]]. This depends crucially on finding (preferrably friendly) informants within the society, who will teach you their culture's rules of social behaviour, and include you in their activities.  Then, as much as possible, you will try to eat their food, speak their language, and live their lives, often actually residing with a family in that society.  It is not easy work, and it is not always fun, but there is no better way to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{portal}}'''Archaeology''' or '''archeology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''Œ±œÅœáŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ'' = ancient and ''ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ'' = word/speech/discourse) is the study of [[Homo (genus)|human]] [[culture]]s through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data, including [[architecture]], [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, [[biofact]]s, human remains, and [[landscape]]s.

The goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human [[culture]], understand [[culture history]], chronicle [[cultural evolution]], and study human [[behavior]] and [[ecology]], for both [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[history|historic]] societies.  It is considered to be one of the four sub-fields of [[anthropology]].

==Usage==
As with words such as [[encyclopedia]] and [[gynaecology]], archaeology traditionally has an ''ae'' combination; however, unlike other words, the ''ae'' is all but universally retained. Contrary to popular belief in other parts of the world, the spelling ''archeology'' is not predominant in [[United States]] [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and would look quite odd to most Americans. Like the claim that ''theater'' refers to a building and ''[[theatre]]'' refers to the [[performing arts]], the belief that ''archeology'' is an [[Americanism]] is little more than an [[urban myth]]. The traditional spelling, ''archaeology'', continues to be used in everyday writing throughout the world, including the U.S., even more so than theatre (the alternate spelling of which, while considered acceptable, is preferred less often than not).

==Ontology and definition==

In the [[Old World]], archaeology has tended to focus on the study of physical remains, the methods used in recovering them and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings in achieving the subject's goals. The discipline's roots in [[antiquarian]]ism and the study of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] provided it with a natural affinity with the field of [[history]]. In the [[New World]], archaeology is more commonly devoted to the study of human [[society|societies]] and is treated as one of the four subfields of [[Anthropology]]. The other subfields of [[anthropology]] supplement the findings of archaeology in a holistic manner.  These subfields are [[cultural anthropology]], which studies behavioural, symbolic, and material dimensions of culture; [[linguistics]], which studies language, including the origins of language and language groups; and [[physical anthropology]], which includes the study of human evolution and physical and [[genetics|genetic]] characteristics. Other disciplines also supplement archaeology, such as [[paleontology]], [[paleozoology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[paleobotany]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[art history]], and [[classics]].

Archaeology has been described as a [[craft]] that enlists the [[science|sciences]] to illuminate the [[humanities]]. Writing in 1948, the American archaeologist [[Walter Taylor]] asserted that &quot;Archaeology is neither history nor anthropology. As an autonomous discipline, it consists of a method and a set of specialised techniques for the gathering, or 'production' of cultural information&quot;.

Archaeology is an approach to understanding human culture through its material remains regardless of chronology. In [[England]], archaeologists have uncovered the long-lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion. In downtown [[New York City]] archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the Black burial ground.  Traditional Archaeology is viewed as the study of pre-historical human cultures; that is cultures that existed before the development of [[writing]] for that culture.  [[Historical archaeology]] is the study of post-[[writing]] cultures.

In the study of relatively recent cultures, which have been observed and studied by Western scholars, archaeology is closely allied with [[ethnography]]. This is the case in large parts of [[North America]], [[Oceania]], [[Siberia]], and other places where the study of archaeology mingles with the living traditions of the cultures being studied. [[Kennewick Man]] is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture.  In the study of cultures that were literate or had literate neighbours, [[history]] and archaeology supplement one another for broader understanding of the complete cultural context, as at [[Hadrian's Wall]].

==Importance and applicability==

Most of human history is not described by any written records. [[Writing]] did not exist anywhere in the world until about 5000 years ago, and only spread among a relatively small number of technologically advanced [[civilisation]]s. In contrast [[Homo Sapiens|''Homo sapiens'']] have existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of [[Homo (genus)|''Homo'']] for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]).  These civilisations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they have been open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a civilisation that is literate at some levels, many important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the formative early years of human civilisation - the development of [[agriculture]], cult practices of [[folk religion]], the rise of the first [[city|cities]] - must come from archaeology.

Even where written records do exist, they are invariably incomplete or biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of an [[aristocracy]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the rest of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases of the literate classes, and cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record is nearer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own inaccuracies, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong [[aesthetic]] appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies. 

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[The Mummy (1999 movie)|The Mummy]]'', and ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of [[pseudoscience]] are invariably levelled at their proponents (see Pseudoarchaeology, below). However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of the modern state of archaeology.

==Goals==

There is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies. These include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites, digging sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein, and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains. Every phase of this process can be a source of information.

The goals of archaeology are not always the same. There are at least three broad, distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do. (These are beyond the scope of the present discussion, and are discussed at length below.) Nevertheless, there is much common ground.

===Academic sub-disciplines===

''Main article: [[Archaeological sub-disciplines]]''

As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a very large number of [[archaeological sub-disciplines]] characterised by a specific method or type of material (e.g. [[lithic analysis]], [[music (archaeology)|music]], [[archaeobotany]]), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. [[Near Eastern archaeology]], [[Medieval archaeology]]), other thematic concern (e.g. [[landscape archaeology]]), or a specific [[archaeological culture]] or [[civilisation]] (e.g. [[Egyptology]]).

===Cultural resources management===
''[[Cultural resources management]]'' (CRM) (also called ''heritage management'' in Britain) is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the [[United States]] and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the United States, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966 and most of the archaeology done in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure. In the United States, the vast majority of taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped to preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, this mandates that no construction project on [[public land]] or involving public funds may damage an unstudied [[archaeological site]]. 

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990 [[PPG 16]] has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the developer's expense.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely. CRM is a thriving entity, especially in the United States and Europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government engage in the practice of their discipline.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour.

==Field methods==
===Survey===
A modern archaeological project often begins with a [[archaeological survey|survey]]. ''Regional survey'' is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. ''Site survey'' is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden|middens]], within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible features there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]], and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.) It avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[settlement pattern|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map|maps]], which may show surface features and/or artefact distribution.

The simplest survey technique is ''surface survey''. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport, to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger|augers]], [[corer|corers]], and [[shovel test]] pits.

''[[Aerial survey]]'' is conducted using [[camera|cameras]] attached to [[aircraft]], [[balloon|balloons]], or even [[kite|kites]]. A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant|Plants]] growing above a stone structure, such as a wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden|middens]]) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial survey also employs [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, and [[thermography]].

''[[Geophysical survey]]'' is the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer|Magnetometers]] detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artefacts, [[kiln|kilns]], some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Most soils are [[moisture|moist]] below the surface, which gives them a relatively low resistivity. Features such as hard-packed floors or concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity. 

Although some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector|metal detectors]] to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying. Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context.  In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].

Regional survey in maritime archaeology uses [[side-scan sonar]].

===Excavation===
[[Excavation|Archaeological excavation]] existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as stratigraphy, three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Similarly, their [[archaeological association|association]], or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct [[culture|cultures]], artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. It is common for large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), to be used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the natural [[subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the [[context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

==Post-excavation analysis==
Once artefacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them, to gain as much data as possible. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is normally the most time-consuming part of the archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published.

At its most basic, the artefacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections, in order to classify them [[typology|typologically]] and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined. The bones, plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed (using the techniques of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], and [[palynology]]), while any texts can usually be [[Decipherment|deciphered]].

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

==History of archaeology==
''Main article: [[History of archaeology]]''

The history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation, and the use of an increasing range of techniques, to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible.

Excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years, but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts.

It was only in the 19th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out. Archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals, including [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] and [[William Flinders Petrie]].

This process was continued in the 20th century by such people as [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained.

During the 20th century, the development of [[urban archaeology]] and then [[rescue archaeology]] have been important factors, as has the development of [[archaeological science]], which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain.

==Archaeological theory==
''Main article: [[Archaeological theory]]''

There is no single theory of archaeology, and even definitions are disputed. Until the mid-20th century and the introduction of technology, there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology. The first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as '''[[Cultural-history archaeology|cultural, or culture, history]]''', which was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In the 1960s, a number of young, primarily American archaeologists, such as [[Lewis Binford]], rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history. They proposed a &quot;New Archaeology&quot;, which would be more &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;anthropological&quot;, with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as '''[[processual archaeology]]'''.

In the 1980s, a new movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]], [[Christopher Tilley]], [[Daniel Miller]], and [[Ian Hodder]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism, becoming known as '''[[post-processual archaeology]]'''. However, this approach has been criticised by processualists as lacking scientific rigour. The validity of both processualism and post-procuessualism is still under debate.

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought]], [[phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[Functionalism (sociology)|Functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[Feminist archaeology]], and [[Systems theory in archaeology|Systems theory]].

==Public archaeology==
Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Such pursuits continue to fascinate the public, portrayed in books (such as ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'') and films (such as ''[[The Mummy (1999 movie)|The Mummy]]'' and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'').

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop√°n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational. In addition, archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in modern [[archaeological survey|survey]], [[excavation]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]] techniques. Some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as &quot;[[pseudoarchaeology]]&quot;.

Nevertheless, archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media. Many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of [[Indiana Jones]] films and [[Tomb Raider games]] as the inspiration for them to enter the field. Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support, the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed. Without a strong public interest in the subject, often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists, it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require.

In the UK, popular archaeology programmes such as ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[Meet the Ancestors]]'' have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.  Where possible, archaeologists now make more provision for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did. However, the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour, and even this is less freely available than before. Developer-funded excavation necessitates a well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately, observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies. Anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group.

===Pseudoarchaeology===
''Main article: [[Pseudoarchaeology]]''.

Pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of [[processual archaeology]], or the specific critiques of it contained in  [[Post-processual archaeology|Post-processualism]].

An example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D√§niken]]. His ''[[Chariots of the Gods]]'' (1968), together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], is not exclusively D√§niken's nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

===Looting===
Looting of archaeological sites by people in search of [[hoard|hoards]] of buried treasure is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh|pharaohs]] were looted in antiquity. The advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest, but it has also attracted unwelcome attention to the works of past peoples. A brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the [[illicit antiquities]] trade, which smuggles items abroad to private collectors. Looters damage the integrity of a historic site, deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation, and are often deemed to be robbing local people of their heritage. 

The popular consciousness often associates looting with poor [[Third World]] countries. Many are former homes to many well-known ancient civilizations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites. Certainly, the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmer's income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people. However, looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the United States and Western Europe as well. Abandoned towns of the ancient [[Sinagua]] people of [[Arizona]], clearly visible in the desert landscape, have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters. Sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted. Where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night, with the [[metal detector]] a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig.

===Public outreach===
Motivated by a desire to halt '''looting''', curb '''pseudoarchaeology''', and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work, archaeologists are mounting '''public-outreach campaigns'''. They seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to science and their own heritage. Common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation.

The final audience for archaeologists' work is the public and it is increasingly realised that their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them. The putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites.

===Descendant peoples===
In the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present. To an archaeologist, the past is long-gone and must be reconstructed through its material remains; to indigenous peoples, it is often still alive.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism, some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.

====Repatriation====
A new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred June 21, 2005, when a community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation in [[Kanawagi, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods ‚Äî some dating back 6,000 years. 

The ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles. The remains and artifacts, including [[beads]], [[tools]] and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Islands]]. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]‚Äôs research collection for decades, some since the late 1800s. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[beaver pelts]]. 

Now, an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 90 boxes of various sizes are buried. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement (source: [http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/archaeology.asp Canadian Geographic Online]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic, and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science ==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:

:Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.

:Agronomy is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:

* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity|production]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* [[traditional agricultural systems]] such as which serve to feed most people in the world and which often retain integration with nature in a way that hs proven more sustainable than modern systems
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers of China and India.

== Agricultural science: a local science ==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interation with nature.

== History of agricultural science ==
''Main Article: [[History of agricultural science]]''

Agricultural science is seen by some to have began with [[Mendel]]'s insightful genetc work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]]. Today it is very different from what it was even in 1950. Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non-essential eeconomic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

== Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==

Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as Avian Flu, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

[[Image:Alchemist's Laboratory, Heinrich Khunrath, Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae, 1595 c.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Alchemist's laboratory, by Hans Vredman de Vries, c 1595.]]

'''Alchemy''' is an early [[protoscience|protoscientific]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] discipline combining elements of [[chemistry]], [[metallurgy]], [[physics]], [[medicine]], [[astrology]], [[semiotics]], [[mysticism]], [[spiritualism]], and [[art]]. Alchemy has been practiced in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[India]], and [[China]], in [[Classical Antiquity|Classical]] [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], in the [[Caliphate|Islamic empire]], and then in [[Europe]] up to the 19th century &amp;mdash; in a complex network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.

Western alchemy has always been closely connected with [[Hermeticism]], a philosophical and spiritual system that traces its roots to [[Hermes Trismegistus]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] Egyptian-Greek deity and legendary alchemist. These two disciplines influenced the birth of [[Rosicrucianism]], an important esoteric movement of the 17th century. In the 19th century, as mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry, its mystic and Hermetic aspects became the focus of a modern [[spiritual alchemy]], where material manipulations are viewed as mere symbols of spiritual transformations.  

The alchemists did not follow what is now known as the [[scientific method]], and much of the &quot;knowledge&quot; they produced was later found to be banal, limited, wrong, or meaningless. Today, the discipline is of interest mainly to [[history of science|historians of science]] and [[history of philosophy|philosophy]], and for its mystic, [[esoterism|esoteric]], and artistic aspects.  Nevertheless, alchemy was one of the main precursors of modern [[science]]s, and we owe to the ancient alchemists the discovery of many substances and processes that are the mainstay of modern chemical and metallurgical industries.  

==Overview==
[[Image:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The alchemist - by Sir [[William Fettes Douglas]].]]

=== Alchemy as a proto-science ===
The common perception of alchemists is that they were [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientists]], [[crackpot]]s and [[charlatans]], who attempted to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]], believed that the universe was composed of the [[classical element|four elements]] of earth, air, fire, and water, and spent most of their time concocting miraculous [[medication|remedies]], [[poison]]s, and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[potion]]s. 

This picture is rather unfair.  Although many alchemists were indeed crackpots and charlatans, many were well-meaning and intelligent scholars, who were simply struggling to make sense of a subject which, as we now know, was far beyond the reach of their tools.  These people were basically &quot;proto-scientists&quot;, who attempted to explore and investigate the nature of chemical substances and processes. They had to rely on unsystematic experimentation, traditional know-how, [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]], &amp;mdash; and plenty of speculative thought to fill in the wide gaps in existing knowledge. 

Given these conditions, the mystic character of alchemy is quite understandable: to the early alchemist, chemical transformations could only seem like magical phenomena governed by incomprehensible laws, whose potential and limitations he had no way of knowing. Having discovered that a specific procedure could turn an earth-like ore into glistening metal, it was only natural to speculate that some different procedure could turn a metal into another.

At the same time, it was clear to the alchemists that &quot;something&quot; was generally being conserved in chemical processes, even in the most dramatic changes of physical state and appearance; i.e. that substances contained some &quot;principles&quot; that could be hidden under many outer forms, and revealed by proper manipulation.  Throughout the history of the discipline, alchemists struggled very hard to understand the nature of these principles, and find some order and sense in the results of their chemical experiments &amp;mdash; which were often undermined by impure or poorly characterized reagents, the lack of quantitative measurements, and confusing and inconsistent nomenclature.

In spite of those difficulties, and of many false turns and loops, the alchemists managed to make steady progress in the understanding of the natural world. To them we owe the discovery of many important substances and chemical processes, which paved the way for the modern science of chemistry, and are still the mainstay of  today's chemical and metallurgical industries.

=== Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline ===
The best known goals of the [[alchemist]]s were the [[transmutation]] of common metals into [[gold]] or [[silver]], and the creation of a &quot;[[universal panacea|panacea]]&quot;, a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. Starting with the Middle Ages, European alchemists invested much effort on the search for the  &quot;[[philosopher's stone]]&quot;, a mythical substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals. Alchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries, though not for their pursuit of those unattainable goals, nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature. Rather it was for their mundane contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day &amp;mdash; ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of ink, dyes, paints, and cosmetics, leather tanning, ceramics and glass manufacture, preparation of extracts and liquors, and so on. (It seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists.) 

On the other hand, alchemists never had the intellectual tools nor the motivation to separate the physical (chemical) aspects of their craft from the metaphysical interpretations. Indeed, from antiquity until well into the [[Modern Age]], a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation. For one thing, the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes, as well as the need for secrecy, led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of [[Bible|biblical]] and [[Paganism|pagan]] [[mythology]], [[astrology]], [[kabbalah]], and other mystic and [[esoterism|esoteric]] fields; so that even the plainest chemical recipe ended up reading like an abstruse magic incantation.  Moreover, alchemists sought in those fields the theoretical frameworks into which they could fit their growing collection of disjointed experimental facts.

Starting with the middle ages, some alchemists increasingly came to view these metaphysical aspects as the true foundation of alchemy; and chemical substances, physical states, and material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, states and transformations. Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented some mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented some hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laborously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning.

Some humanistic scholars now see these spiritual and metaphysical allegories as the truest and most valuable aspect of alchemy, and even claim that the development of chemistry out of alchemy was a &quot;corruption&quot; of the original Hermetic tradition. This is the view espoused by contemporary practitioners of [[spiritual alchemy]]. Most scientists, on the other hand, tend to take quite the opposite view: to them, the path from the material side of alchemy to modern chemistry was the &quot;straight road&quot; in the evolution of the discipline, while the  metaphysically oriented brand of alchemy was a &quot;wrong turn&quot; that led to nowhere. In either view, however, the na√Øve interpretations of some practitoners or the fraudulent hopes fostered by others should not diminish the contribution of the more sincere alchemists.

===Alchemy and astrology===
Since its earliest times, alchemy has been closely connected to [[astrology]] &amp;mdash; which, in Islam and Europe, generally meant the traditional [[Babylon]]ian-Greek school of astrology. Alchemical systems often postulated that each of the seven [[planet]]s known to the ancients &quot;[[astrological sign|ruled]]&quot; or was associated with a certain [[metal]]. See the separate article on [[astrology and alchemy]] for further details.

===Alchemy in the age of science===
Up to the 18th century, alchemy was actually considered serious science in Europe; for instance, [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics, for which he is famous, (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]). Other eminent alchemists of the Western world are [[Roger Bacon]], Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Thomas Browne]], and [[Parmigianino]]. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational materialism.  

In the first half of the nineteenth century, one established chemist, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], researched on concepts similar to the old alchemy, such as the [[Odic force]], but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.

Matter transmutation, the old goal of alchemy, enjoyed a moment in the sun in the 20th century when physicists were able to convert lead atoms into gold atoms via a [[nuclear reaction]]. However, the new gold atoms, being unstable [[isotope]]s, lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart.  More recently, reports of table-top element transmutation ‚Äî by means of [[electrolysis]] or [[sonic cavitation]] ‚Äî were the pivot of the [[cold fusion]] controversy of 1989. None of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated.

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used in the 20th century by [[psychology|psychologists]] and philosophers. [[Carl Jung]] reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path. Alchemical philosophy, symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in [[post-modernism|post-modern]] contexts, such as the [[New Age]] movement. Even some physicists have played with alchemical ideas in books such as ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]''.

===Alchemy as a subject of historical research ===
The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure&amp;mdash;''hermetic'', of course&amp;mdash;language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more  aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[kabbala|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements, [[cryptography]], [[witchcraft]]&amp;mdash;and, of course, the evolution of [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionarypar|alchemy}}
The word ''alchemy'' comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-k&amp;#299;miya&amp;#704;'' or ''al-kh&amp;#299;miya&amp;#704;'' (&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1569; or &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1582;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1569;), which might be formed from the article ''al-'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''chumeia''  (&amp;chi;Œ∑&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;#943;&amp;alpha;) meaning &quot;cast together&quot;, &quot;pour together&quot;, &quot;weld&quot;, &quot;alloy&quot;, etc. (from ''khumatos'', &quot;that which is poured out, an ingot&quot;, or from Persian ''Kimia'' meaning &quot;gold.&quot; A decree of [[Diocletian]], written about 300 CE in Greek, speaks against &quot;the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the ''kh&amp;#275;mia'' [transmutation] of gold and silver&quot;. 

It has been suggested that the Arabic word ''al-k&amp;#299;miya&amp;#704;'' actually means &quot;the Egyptian [science]&quot;, borrowing from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word for &quot;Egypt&quot;, ''k&amp;#275;me'' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval [[Bohairic]] dialect of Coptic, ''kh&amp;#275;me''). The Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''km&amp;#7881;'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour &quot;black&quot; (Egypt was the &quot;Black Land&quot;, by contrast with the &quot;Red Land&quot;, the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname &quot;Egyptian black arts&quot;. However, this theory may be just an example of [[folk etymology]].

==History==
[[Image:Alchemy-Digby-RareSecrets.png|thumb|right|300px|Extract and symbol key from a 17th century book on alchemy. The symbols used have a one-to-one correspondence with symbols used in [[astrology]] at the time.]]
Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents.  These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. 

One can distinguish at least two major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in [[China]] and its zone of cultural influence; and [[Western alchemy]], whose center has shifted over the millennia between [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], the [[Islam]]ic world, and finally back to [[Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system, with only superficial connections to the major Western religions.  It is still an open question whether these two strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

===Alchemy in Ancient Egypt===
The origin of western alchemy may generally be traced to [[Ancient Egypt|ancient (pharaonic) Egypt]].  [[Metallurgy]] and [[mysticism]] were inexorably tied together in the ancient world, as the transformation of drab ore into shining metal must have seemed to be an act of magic governed by mysterious rules. It is claimed therefore that Alchemy in ancient Egypt was the domain of the priestly class.  

Egyptian alchemy is known mostly through the writings of ancient (Hellenic) [[Greece|Greek]] philosophers, which in turn have often survived only in Islamic translations. Practically no original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived. Those writings, if they existed, were likely lost when the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292), which had been a center of Egyptian alchemy.

Nevertheless [[archaeological]] expeditions in recent times have unearthed evidence of chemical analysis during the [[Naqada]] periods. For example, a [[copper]] tool dating to the [[Naqada]] era bears evidence of having been used in such a way (reference: artifact 5437 on display at [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/naqada/tombs/finds7.html]). Also, the process of [[tanning]] [[animal]] [[Rawhide|skins]] was already known in [[Predynastic Egypt]] as early as the [[6th millennium BC]] [http://www.touregypt.net/ebph5.htm]; although it possibly was discovered haphazardly.

Other evidence indicates early alchemists in [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] had invented [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] by [[4000 BC]] and [[glass]] by [[1500 BC]]. The chemical reaction involved in the production of [[Calcium Oxide]] is one of the oldest known (references: [[Calcium Oxide]], [[limekiln]]):

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + heat ‚Üí CaO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Ancient Egypt]] additionally produced [[cosmetics]], [[cement]], [[faience]] and also [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[shipbuilding]]. [[Papyrus]] had also been invented by [[3000 BC]].

Legend has it that the founder of Egyptian alchemy was the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]], called Hermes-Thoth or Thrice-Great Hermes (''[[Hermes Trismegistus]]'') by the Greek. According to legend, he wrote what were called the forty-two Books of Knowledge, covering all fields of knowledge‚Äîincluding alchemy. Hermes's symbol was the [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, which became one of many of alchemy's principal symbols. The &quot;[[Emerald Tablet]]&quot; or ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes, which is known only through Greek and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners.

The first point of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; tells the purpose of hermetical science: &quot;in truth certainly and without doubt, whatever is below is like that which is above, and whatever is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt, p. 196-7|a}} This is the [[macrocosm]]-[[microcosm]] belief central to the hermetic philosophy.  In other words, the human body (the microcosm) is affected by the exterior world (the macrocosm), which includes the heavens through [[astrology]], and the earth through the [[classical element|element]]s. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt,p. 34-42|b}}

It has been speculated that a riddle from the Emerald Tablet‚Äî&quot;it was carried in the womb by the wind&quot;‚Äîrefers to the distillation of oxygen from [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]‚Äîa process that was unknown in Europe until its (re)discovery by Sendivogius in the 17th century.

In the 4th century BC, the Greek-speaking [[Macedon|Macedonia]]ns conquered Egypt and founded the city of Alexandria in 332.  This brought them into contact with Egyptian ideas. See [[#Alchemy in the Greek world|Alchemy in the Greek World]] below.

===Chinese alchemy===
Whereas Western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.  The [[philosopher's stone]] of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than it initially appears.

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. Described in 9th century texts and used in [[fireworks]] by the 10th Century, it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290. From China, the use of gunpowder spread to [[Japan]], the [[Mongol]]s, the Arab world and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe starting with the 14th century.

Black powder was most likely invented in the middle east before it found its way
to China. Saltpeter, the critical oxidising component, was found naturally in India and
along the Salt trade routes in the Middle East.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]], and to [[martial arts]] such as [[Tai Chi Chuan]] and [[Kung Fu]] (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the Hygienic or Philosophical branches of Taoism, not the Alchemical).

===Indian alchemy===
Little is known in the West about the character and history of [[India]]n alchemy. An 11th century [[Iran|Persia]]n alchemist named [[al-Biruni]] reported that they &quot;have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which is called [[RasavƒÅtam]]. It means the art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, compounds, and medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.&quot;  The best example of a text based on this science is ''The Vaishashik Darshana'' of [[Kanad]]a (fl. 600 BC), who described an atomic theory over a century before Democritus.

The texts of [[Ayurvedic]] Medicine and Science have aspects related to alchemy, such having cures for all known diseases. The similarities in [[Ayurveda]] and alchemy are that both had methods used to treat people by putting oils over them.

Some people have also noted certain similarities between the [[metaphysics]] of the [[Samkhya]] philosophical tradition of Hinduism and the metaphysics of alchemy. Whether there is any direct connection between the two systems is an open question.

The Rasavadam was understood by very few people at the time. Two famous examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya was a buddhist monk who, in ancient times, ran the great university of Nagarjuna Sagar. His famous book, Rasaratanakaram, is a famous example of early Indian medicine. 
In traditional Indian medicinal terminology 'rasa' translates as 'mercury' and Nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold. Much of his original writings are lost to us, but his teachings still have strong influence on traditional Indian medicine (Ayureveda) to this day.

===Alchemy in the Greek world===
The Greek city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt was a center of Greek alchemical knowledge, and retained its preeminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. The Greeks appropriated the hermetical beliefs of the Egyptians and melded with them the philosophies of [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreanism]], [[ionianism]], and [[gnosticism]]. Pythagorean philosophy is, essentially, the belief that numbers rule the universe, originating from the observations of sound, stars, and geometric shapes like triangles, or anything from which a [[ratio]] could be derived. [[Ionia]]n thought was based on the belief that the universe could be explained through concentration on [[phenomenon|natural phenomena]]; this philosophy is believed to have originated with [[Thales]] and his pupil [[Anaximander]], and later developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], whose works came to be an integral part of alchemy.  According to this belief, the universe can be described by a few unified [[law (principle)|natural laws]] that can be determined only through careful, thorough, and exacting philosophical explorations. The third component introduced to hermetical philosophy by the Greeks was [[gnosticism]], a belief prevalent in the Christian and early post-Christian [[Roman empire]], that the world is imperfect because it was created in a flawed manner, and that learning about the nature of spiritual matter would lead to salvation.  They further believed that [[god (monotheism)|God]] did not &quot;create&quot; the universe in the classic sense, but that the universe was created &quot;from&quot; him, but was corrupted in the process (rather than becoming corrupted by the transgressions of Adam and Eve, i.e. [[original sin]]).  According to Gnostic belief, by worshipping the cosmos, nature, or the creatures of the world, one worships the True God.  Gnostics do not seek salvation from sin, but instead seek to escape ignorance, believing that sin is merely a consequence of ignorance. Platonic and neo-Platonic theories about universals and the omnipotence of God were also absorbed.

One very important concept introduced at this time, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: ''earth'', ''air'', ''water'', and ''fire''. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed. {{ref_harvard|Lindsay|Lindsay, p. 16|a}}  

The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are. &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Hitchcock|Hitchcock, p. 66|a}} Later alchemists (if Plato and Aristotle can be called alchemists) extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

===Alchemy in the Roman Empire===
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted Greek alchemy and metaphysics, just as they adopted much of Greek knowledge and philosophy. By the end of the [[Roman empire]] the Greek alchemical philosophy had been joined to the philosophies of the Egyptians to create the cult of Hermeticism. {{ref_harvard|Lindsay|Lindsay|b}}

However, the development of [[Christianity]] in the Empire brought a contrary line of thinking, stemming from [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354-430 AD), an early Christian philosopher who wrote of his beliefs shortly before the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. In essence, he felt that [[reason]] and [[faith]] could be used to understand God, but [[experimental philosophy]] was evil: &quot;There is also present in the soul, by means of these same bodily sense, a kind of empty longing and curiosity which aims not at taking pleasure in the flesh but at acquiring experience through the flesh, and this empty curiosity he is dignified by the names of learning and science.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Augustine|Augustine, p. 245|a}}

Augustinian ideas were decidedly anti-experimental, yet when Aristotelian experimental techniques were made available to the West they were not shunned.  Still, Augustinian thought was well ingrained in [[medieval society]] and was used to show alchemy as being un-Godly.

Much of the Roman knowledge of Alchemy, like that of the Greeks and Egyptians, is now lost. In Alexandria, the centre of alchemical studies in the Roman Empire, the art was mainly oral and in the interests of secrecy little was committed to paper. (Whence the use of &quot;hermetic&quot; to mean &quot;secretive&quot;.) {{ref_harvard|Lindsay|Lindsay, p. 155|c}} It is possible that some writing was done in Alexandria, and that it was subsequently lost or destroyed in fires and the turbulent periods that followed.

===Alchemy in the Islamic world===
After the fall of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Middle East. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Islamic translations. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt p. 46|c}}

The Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated.  Islamic alchemists such as [[Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi|al-Razi]] (Latin Rasis or Rhazes) contributed key chemical discoveries of their own, such as the technique of [[distillation]] (the words ''[[alembic]]'' and ''[[alcohol]]'' are of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin), the [[hydrochloric acid|muriatic]], [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]], and [[nitric acid|nitric]] acids, [[sodium carbonate|soda]], [[potash]], and more. (From the Arabic names of the last two substances, ''al-natrun'' and ''al-qalƒ´y'', Latinized into ''Natrium'' and ''Kalium'', come the modern symbols for [[sodium]] and [[potassium]].) The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids, could dissolve the noblest metal; gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism.  
The most influential author in this regard was arguably [[Abu Musa Jabir Ibn Hayyan|Jabir Ibn Hayyan]] (Arabic &amp;#1580;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1585; &amp;#1573;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1606; &amp;#1581;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1606;, Latin Geberus; usually rendered in English as Geber). Jabir's ultimate goal was [[takwin]], the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to and including human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burkhardt, p. 29|d}}  According to Geber, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist.  Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt, p. 29|e}} By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties. 

It is now commonly accepted that Chinese alchemy influenced Arabic alchemists {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes pp. 33-59|a}}{{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt, p. 10-22|f}}, although the extent of that influence is still a matter of debate. Likewise, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] learning was assimilated into Islamic alchemy, but again the extent and effects of this are not well known.

===Alchemy in Medieval Europe===
[[Image:JosephWright-Alchemist-1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The Alchemist in Search of the Philosophers Stone''. By [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], [[1771]].]]
Because of its strong connections to the Greek and Roman cultures, alchemy was rather easily accepted into Christian philosophy, and Medieval European alchemists extensively absorbed Islamic alchemical knowledge.  [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], who was later to become [[Pope Silvester II]], (d. 1003) was among the first to bring Islamic science to Europe from [[Spain]].  Later men such as [[Adelard of Bath]], who lived in the 12th century, brought additional learning.  But until the 13th century the moves were mainly assimilative. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 124, 294|a}}

In this period there appeared some deviations from the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] principles of earlier Christian thinkers. [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] (1033‚Äì1109) was a Benedictine who believed faith must precede rationalism, as Augustine and most theologians prior to Anselm had believed, but Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context.  His views set the stage for the philosophical explosion to occur. [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm's work, laying the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle reached the West.  His major influence on alchemy was his belief that Platonic universals did not have a separate existence outside of man's [[consciousness]]. Abelard also systematized the analysis of philosophical contradictions. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister, p. 287-8|b}}

[[Robert Grosseteste]] (1170‚Äì1253) was a pioneer of the scientific theory that would later be used and refined by the alchemists.  He took
Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observations, experimentation, and conclusions in making scientific evaluations. Grosseteste also did much work to bridge Platonic and Aristotelian thinking. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister pp. 294-5|c}}

[[Albertus Magnus]] (1193‚Äì1280) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225‚Äì1274) were both [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s who studied Aristotle and worked at reconciling the differences between philosophy and Christianity.  Aquinas also did a great deal of work in developing the [[scientific method]].  He even went as far as claiming that universals could be discovered only through [[logical reasoning]], and, since [[reason]] could not run in opposition to God, reason must be compatible with [[theology]]. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 290-4, 355|d}}. This ran contrary to the commonly held Platonic belief that universals were found through [[divine illumination]] alone. Magnus and Aquinas were among the first to take up the examination of alchemical theory, and could be considered to be alchemists themselves, except that these two did little in the way of [[experimentation]]. 

The first true alchemist in Medieval Europe was [[Roger Bacon]].  His work did as much for alchemy as [[Robert Boyle]]'s was to do for [[chemistry]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s for [[astronomy]] and [[physics]]. Bacon (1214‚Äì1294) was an Oxford [[Franciscan]] who explored [[optics]] and [[linguistics|languages]] in addition to alchemy. The Franciscan ideals of taking on the world rather than rejecting the world led to his conviction that experimentation was more important than reasoning: &quot;Of the three ways in which men think that they acquire [[knowledge]] of things: authority, [[reason|reasoning]], and [[experience]]; only the last is effective and able to bring peace to the intellect.&quot; (Bacon p. 367) &quot;[[Experimental Science]] controls the conclusions of all other sciences. It reveals truths which reasoning from [[law (principle)|general principles]] would never have discovered.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 294-5|e}}  Roger Bacon has also been attributed with originating the search for the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life: &quot;That medicine which will remove all impurities and corruptibilities from the lesser metals will also, in the opinion of the wise, take off so much of the corruptibility of the body that human life may be prolonged for many centuries.&quot; The idea of [[immortality]] was replaced with the notion of [[longevity|long life]]; after all, man's time on Earth was simply to wait and prepare for immortality in the world of God. Immortality on Earth did not mesh with Christian theology.  {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes p. 37-8|b}}

Bacon was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages, but he was the most significant. His works were used by countless alchemists of the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries. Other alchemists of Bacon's time shared several traits. First, and most obviously, nearly all were members of the clergy.  This was simply because few people outside the parochial schools had the education to examine the Arabic-derived works.  Also, alchemy at this time was sanctioned by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology. Alchemy was interesting to the wide variety of churchmen because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe when men were just beginning to learn about rationalism. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes p. 24-7|c}}

So by the end of the thirteenth century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (e.g., if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]].) They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam.  By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt p. 149|g}}

In the fourteenth century, these views underwent a major change. [[William of Ockham]], an [[Oxford]] Franciscan who died in 1349, attacked the [[Thomist]] view of compatibility between faith and reason. His view, widely accepted today, was that God must be accepted on faith alone; He could not be limited by human reason. Of course this view was not incorrect if one accepted the postulate of a limitless God versus limited human reasoning capability, but it virtually erased alchemy from practice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 335|f}} [[Pope John XXII]] in the early 1300s issued an edict against alchemy, which effectively removed all church personnel from the practice of the Art. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes, p.49|d}} The climate changes, [[Black Death|Black plague]], and increase in [[war|warfare]] and [[famine]] that characterized this century no doubt also served to hamper philosophical pursuits in general.

[[Image:flamel-figures.png|thumb|250px|[[Nicholas Flamel]] had these mysterious alchemical symbols carved on his [[tomb]] in the Church of the [[Holy Innocents]] in Paris.]]
Alchemy was kept alive by men such as [[Nicolas Flamel]], who was noteworthy only because he was one of the few alchemists writing in those troubled times. Flamel lived from 1330 to 1417 and would serve as the [[archetype]] for the next phase of alchemy. He was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone, which he is reputed to have found; his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosophers' stone. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt pp.170-181|h}}

Through the [[high middle ages]] (1300-1500) alchemists were much like Flamel:  they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone and the elixir of youth, now believed to be separate things.  Their cryptic allusions and [[symbolism]] led to wide variations in interpretation of the art. For example, many alchemists during this period interpreted the purification of the soul to mean the [[transmutation]] of lead into gold (in which they believed elemental [[mercury (element)|mercury]], or 'quicksilver', played a crucial role). These men were viewed as [[magic (paranormal)|magicians and sorcerers]] by many, and were often persecuted for their practices. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes pp. 50-75|e}}{{ref_harvard|Norton|Norton pp lxiii-lxvii|a}}

One of these men who emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century was named [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]. This alchemist believed himself to be a wizard and actually thought himself capable of summoning [[spiritual being|spirit]]s.  His influence was negligible, but like Flamel, he produced writings which were referred to by alchemists of later years. Again like Flamel, he did much to change alchemy from a mystical philosophy to an [[occult]]ist magic. He did keep alive the philosophies of the earlier alchemists, including experimental science, numerology, etc., but he added magic theory, which reinforced the idea of alchemy as an occultist belief.  In spite of all this, Agrippa still considered himself a Christian, though his views often came into conflict with the church. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes p.56-9|f}}{{ref_harvard|Wilson|Wilson p.23-9|a}}

===Alchemy in the Modern Age and Renaissance===
European alchemy continued in this way through the dawning of the [[Renaissance]].  The era also saw a flourishing of [[con artist]]s who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the transmutation of common metals into gold, or claim to possess secret knowledge that ‚Äî with a &quot;small&quot; initial investment ‚Äî would surely lead to that goal. 

The most important name in this period is Philippus Aureolus [[Paracelsus]], (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493‚Äì1541) who cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of the occultism that had accumulated over the years and promoting the use of observations and experiments to learn about the human body. He rejected Gnostic traditions, but kept much of the Hermetical, neo-Platonic, and Pythagorean philosophies; however, Hermetical science had so much Aristotelian theory that his rejection of Gnosticism was practically meaningless. In particular, Paracelsus rejected the magic theories of Agrippa and Flamel. He did not think of himself as a magician, and scorned those who did. (Williams p.239-45) 

Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes, p.47|g}} His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification  but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. {{ref_harvard|Debus|Debus &amp; Multhauf, p.6-12|a}} While his attempts of treating diseases with such remedies as Mercury might seem ill-advised from a modern point of view, his basic idea of chemically produced medicines has stood time surprisingly well.

In [[England]], the topic of alchemy in that time frame is often associated  with Doctor [[John Dee]] ([[13 July]] [[1527]] ‚Äì December, 1608), better known for his role as [[astrologer]], cryptographer, and general &quot;scientific consultant&quot; to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Dee was considered an authority on the works of [[Roger Bacon]], and was interested enough in alchemy to write a book on that subject (''Monas Hieroglyphica'', 1564) influenced by the [[Kabbala]]. Dee's associate [[Edward Kelley]] ‚Äî who claimed to converse with [[angel]]s through a crystal ball and to own a powder that would turn [[mercury (element)|mercury]] into [[gold]] ‚Äî may have been the source of the popular image of the alchemist-charlatan. 

Another lesser known alchemist was [[Micha≈Ç Sƒôdziw√≥j|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Micha≈Ç Sƒôdziw√≥j'', 1566 - 1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry. According to some accounts, he distilled [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600, 170 years before [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele|Scheele]] and [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], by warming nitre ([[saltpetre]]). He thought of the gas given off as &quot;the elixir of life&quot;. Shortly after discovering this method, it is believed that Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]]. In 1621, Drebbel practically applied this in a submarine.

[[Tycho Brahe]] (1546‚Äì1601), better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, was also an alchemist. He had a laboratory built for that purpose at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute.

===The decline of Western alchemy===
The demise of Western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century.

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627‚Äì1691), better known for his studies of gases (cf. [[Boyle's law]]) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data; in a typical experiment, Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.  {{ref_harvard|Pilkington|Pilkington p.11|a}} This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century|19th]] centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]] ‚Äî which finally provided a logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations, and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philospher's stone.

Meanwhile, Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine.  Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body, such as blood circulation ([[William Harvey|Harvey]], [[1616]]), and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs ([[Robert Koch|Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]], 19th century) or lack of ''natural'' nutrients and [[vitamin]]s ([[James Lind|Lind]], [[Christiaan Eijkman|Eijkman]], [[Casimir Funk|Funk]], et al.). Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry, the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles, interpretive and prescriptive, while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies.

Thus, as science steadily continued to uncover and rationalize the clockwork of the universe, founded on its own materialistic metaphysics, Alchemy was left deprived of its chemical and medical connections ‚Äî but still incurably burdened by them.  Reduced to an arcane philosophical system, poorly connected to the material world, it suffered the common fate of other [[esoteric]] disciplines such as [[astrology]] and [[Kabbalah]]: excluded from [[university]] curricula, shunned by its former patrons, [[damned knowledge|ostracized]] by scientists, and commonly viewed as the epitome of [[charlatan]]ism and [[superstition]].

These developments could be interpreted as part of a broader reaction in European intellectualism against the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the preceding century. Be as it may, it is sobering to observe how a discipline that held so much intellectual and material prestige, for more than two thousand years, could disappear so easily from the universe of Western thought.

===Modern 'alchemy'===
In modern times, progress has been made toward achieving the goals of alchemy using scientific, rather than alchemic, means.  These developments may on occasion be called &quot;alchemy&quot; for rhetorical reasons.

In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] used [[artificial disintegration]] to convert nitrogen into oxygen. This process of bombarding the atomic nucleus with high energy particles is the principle behind modern [[particle accelerators]], in which transmutations of elements are common. Indeed, in 1980, [[Glenn Seaborg]] transmuted lead into gold, though the amount of energy used and the microscopic quantities created negated any possible financial benefit.

In 1964,  [[George Ohsawa]] and [[Michio Kushi]], based on the claims of [[Louis Kervran]], reportedly successfully transmutated [[sodium]] into [[potassium]], by use of an electric arc, and later of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] into [[iron]]. In 1994, [[R. Sundaresan]] and [[J. Bockris]] reported that they had observed fusion reactions in electrical discharges between carbon rods immersed in water. However, none of these claims have been replicated by other scientists, and the idea is now thoroughly discredited.

As of 2006, a universal panacea remains elusive, though [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] believe sufficiently advanced [[nanotechnology]] may prolong life indefinitely. Some say the third goal of alchemy has been fulfilled by [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] and the [[cloning]] of a human embryo, although these technologies fall far short of creating a human life from scratch.

The aim of [[artificial intelligence]] research could be said to be creating a life from scratch, and those philosophically opposed to the possibility of AI have compared it with alchemy, such as Herbert and Stuart Dreyfus in their 1960 paper ''Alchemy and AI''.

==Alchemy in art and entertainment ==
References to alchemy in art and entertainment are far too numerous to list.  Here we give only a few indicative samples.  More titles can be found in the [[philosopher's stone]] article.

===Novels and plays===
Many [[literature|writers]] lampooned alchemists and used them as the butt of [[satire|satirical]] attacks.  Two early and well-known examples are

*[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''[[The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale|Canon's Yeoman's Tale]]'' (ca. 1380). The main character, an alchemist on the way to [[Canterbury]], claims that he will &quot;pave it all of silver and of gold&quot;.
*[[Ben Jonson]], ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (ca 1610). In this five-act play, the characters set up an alchemy workshop to swindle people. 

[[Image:Alchemical Laboratory - Project Gutenberg eText 14218.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|An Alchemical Laboratory, from ''The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry'']]

In more recent works, alchemists are generally presented in a more romatic or mystic light, and often little distinction is made between alchemy, magic, and witchcraft:

*[[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|Mary Shelley]],  ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818). Victor Frankenstein uses both alchemy and modern science to create [[Frankenstein's monster]].
*[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' (1832). Faust's servant Wagner uses alchemy to create a [[homunculus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast''' (also called '''ADS-B''') is a system by which [[aircraft|airplanes]] constantly broadcast their current position and altitude, category of aircraft, [[airspeed]], [[identification]], and whether the aircraft is turning, climbing or descending over a dedicated radio [[datalink]]. This functionality is known as &quot;ADS-B out&quot; and is the basic level of ADS-B functionality.

The ADS-B system was developed in the 1990s.  It relies on data from the [[Global Positioning System]], or any navigation system that provides an equivalent or better service. The maximum range of the system is line-of-sight, typically less than 200 [[nautical mile]]s (370 km). 

The ADS-B transmissions are received by [[air traffic control]] stations, and all other ADS-B equipped aircraft within reception range. Reception by aircraft of ADS-B data is known as &quot;ADS-B in&quot;. 

==Usage==
The initial use of ADS-B is expected to be by [[air traffic control]] and for surveillance purposes and for enhancing pilot situational awareness. ADS-B is lower cost than conventional radar and permits higher quality surveillance of airborne and surface movements.  ADS-B is effective in remote areas or in mountainous terrain where there is no radar coverage, or where radar coverage is limited. The outback of Australia is one such area where ADS-B will provide surveillance where previously none existed. ADS-B also enhances surveillance on the airport surface, so it can also be used to monitor traffic on the taxiways and runways of an airport.  

ADS-B equipped aircraft may also have a [[display]] unit in the cockpit picturing surrounding air traffic from ADS-B data (ADS-B in) and TIS-B (Traffic Information Service-Broadcast) data derived from air traffic radar. Both Pilots and [[air traffic controller]]s will then be able to &quot;see&quot; the positions of air traffic in the vicinity of the aircraft, and this may be used to provide an ASAS (Airborne Separation Assurance System).

Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems may in the future also make use of &quot;ADS-B in&quot;, supplementing the existing TCAS collision avoidance system by what is called 'hybrid surveillance'.

Airbus and Boeing are now expected to include ADS-B out (i.e. the transmitter of information) as standard on new-build aircraft from 2005 onwards. This is in part due to the European requirements for Mode S Elementary Surveillance (which uses 1090MHz Mode S transponder which now is normally capable of ADS-B via Extended Squitter), and some common functionality with ADS-B out. 



==Addressed and Broadcast ADS==
The Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics‚Äô ([[RTCA]]) Free Flight Selection Committee defines surveillance as ‚Äúdetection, tracking, characterization and observation of aircraft, other vehicles and weather phenomena for the purpose of conducting flight operations in a safe and efficient manner.&quot;

Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) is described as the process of creating and sending a message including the sender‚Äôs current position and other surveillance information, such as velocity, intent and flight identification. This information supports aircraft separation management by improving surveillance information at increased ranges, situational awareness and decision making. ADS data can be used in cooperation with data from current radar beacon systems, such as Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems (ATCRBS), Mode S, Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) and primary Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar, and may also be used as a sole means of surveillance.

There are two commonly recognized types of ADS for aircraft applications:
*ADS-Addressed (ADS-A), also known as ADS-Contract (ADS-C), and 
*ADS-Broadcast (ADS-B.

ADS-A provides a surveillance data report that is sent to a specific addressee. For example, ADS-A reports are employed in the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) using the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System ([[ACARS]]) as the communication protocol. During transoceanic flight, reports are periodically sent by an aircraft to the controlling air traffic region.

When ADS-B is used, aircraft and other vehicles continuously broadcast a message including position, heading, velocity and intent. Other uses may include obstacles transmitting a position message. Aircraft, ground-based stations,  and other users monitoring the channels can receive the information and use it in a wide variety of applications. Because of this potential for broad utilization, a system using ADS-B is most often discussed as a replacement for or an augmentation to current methods of monitoring aeronautical traffic.

To understand the full capability of ADS-B, consider how the current Air Traffic Control system creates information. The radar measures the range and bearing of an aircraft. Bearing is measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives a response to its interrogation from the aircraft, and range is measured by the time it takes for the radar to receive the interrogation response. 

The antenna beam becomes wider as the aircraft get farther away, making the position information less accurate. Additionally, detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart. In contrast, a system using ADS-B creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft. These reports are generated and distributed using precise
instruments, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and Mode S transponders, meaning integrity of the data is no longer susceptible to the range of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps. The enhanced accuracy of the information will be used to improve safety, support a wide variety of applications and increase airport and airspace capacity.

Use of ADS-B for ground-based surveillance requires only ADS-B Out (transmit) capability on the aircraft. With the addition of ADS-B In (receive) capability, the potential for ADS-B applications grows significantly. Some of the equipment and services associated with ADS-B In capability include:
*Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI), a display of proximate traffic based on ADS-B reports from other aircraft and ground-based facilities.
*Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B), a ground-based uplink report of proximate traffic that is under surveillance by ATC but is not ADS-B-equipped.  This service would be available even with limited ADS-B implementation.
*Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B), a ground-based uplink of flight information services and weather data.

==ADS-B Physical Layer==
Three link solutions are being proposed as the physical layer for relaying the ADS-B position reports: 
*1090 MHz Mode S Extended Squitter (ES), 
*Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) and 
*VHF Digital Link ([[VDL]]) Mode 4. 

===Mode S===
The FAA has announced its selection of the 1090 MHz ES and UAT as the mediums for the ADS-B system in the United States. 1090 MHz ES will be the primary medium for air carrier and high-performance commercial aircraft while UAT will be the primary medium for general aviation aircraft. 

Europe has also chosen 1090 MHz as the primary physical layer for ADS-B. However, the second medium has not yet been selected between UAT and VDL Mode 4.

With 1090 ES, the existing Mode S transponder (or a stand alone 1090 MHz transmitter) supports a message type known as the ES message. It is a periodic message that provides position, velocity, heading, time, and, in the future, intent. The basic ES does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data ‚Äì called trajectory change points. To enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message, the transponder is modified and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder. ATC ground stations and TCAS-equipped aircraft already have the necessary 1090 MHz receivers to receive these signals, and would only require
enhancements to accept and process the additional information. 1090 ES will not support FIS-B, due to regulatory requirements.

===Universal Access Transceiver===
The UAT system is specifically designed for ADS-B operation. A 1 MHz channel in the 900 MHz frequency range is dedicated for transmission of airborne ADS-B reports and for broadcast of ground-based aeronautical information. UAT users would have access to the additional ground-based aeronautical data and would receive reports from proximate traffic (FIS-B and TIS-B).  

===VDL Mode 4===
The VDL Mode 4 system could utilize one or more of the existing aeronautical VHF frequencies as the radio frequency physical layer for ADS-B transmissions. VDL Mode 4 uses a protocol (STDMA) that allows it to be self-organizing, meaning no master ground station is required. This medium is best used for short message transmissions from a large number of users. VDL Mode 4 systems are capable of increased range in comparison to L Band Mode S (1090 MHz) or UAT systems. 

==Implementation Timetable==
The timetable for airborne ADS-B equipage will be determined by ground and airborne facility implementation, equipment cost, perceived benefits of equipping and regulatory actions by the Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA). The cost to equip with ADS-B Out capability is relatively small and would benefit the airspace by enabling increased situational awareness. ADS-B In capability can provide additional benefits when ground stations and the critical mass of aircraft are also equipped. This data was taken into consideration when building the following estimated implementation timetable. 

===Near-term Implementation (2006-2008)=== 
The next three years will see a continuation of ADS-B trials and some implementation in ‚Äúpockets‚Äù where limited aircraft equipage can bring operational benefits. Some of these include:
*'''Capstone'''.  In Alaska, the FAA is conducting its Capstone program to improve surveillance in some of the more remote locations of Alaska and as a test bed for implementing elements of ADS-B into the ATC environment. Approximately 190 general aviation users have been equipped with GPS receivers, UAT transceivers and flight deck displays. In addition, 11 ground-based transceivers have been installed for radar-like services, and flight information services data (FIS-B), including weather information, is being uplinked from the ground. Phase II of the program will expand the coverage and add more than 250 additional users.
*'''Gulf of Mexico''' ‚Äì In the Gulf of Mexico, where ATC radar coverage is incomplete, the FAA is locating ADS-B (1090 MHz) receivers on oil rigs and buoys to relay information received from aircraft equipped with ADS-B extended squitters back to the ATC centers to expand and improve surveillance coverage. 
*'''Australia'''.  Australia is implementing ADS-B trials in Queensland to test the feasibility of 1090 MHz ADS-B as an alternative to ground-based radar. ADS-B is expected to be a much more cost-effective method of providing ATC surveillance coverage for remote areas which currently have limited or no surveillance coverage.
*'''Cargo Airline Association'''.  Cargo carriers operating at their hub airports operate largely at night. Equipage of these aircraft with ADS-B and CDTI displays along with a ground-based transceiver at these hubs will allow better situational awareness at night and in inclement weather and offers the potential for increased airport traffic handling capability.
*'''Embry Riddle Aeronautical University'''.  Embry Riddle Aeronautical University is equipping the training aircraft at its two main campuses in Florida and Arizona with ADS-B capability as a safety enhancement. The FAA will provide FIS-B and TIS-B uplink capabilities in those areas in support of this equipage.
*'''Safe Flight 21 East Coast Broadcast Services'''.  The FAA has announced its intention to implement ADS-B coverage for the entire east coast of the U.S. by the end of 2004. Service range will extend inland 150 miles with a goal of providing coverage at altitudes down to 2,000 feet. The medium will be UAT and the implementation will also include TIS-B and FIS-B information.

===Mid-term Implementation (2008-2012)=== 
Within four to eight years, an increasing number of aircraft with ADS-B Out capability along with the start of ground-based ADS-B infrastructure will begin to make a number of ADS-B applications attractive.
*Benefits of ‚ÄúPockets of Implementation‚Äù will become evident and these areas will be expanded, encouraging more users to equip with ADS-B capability.
*Beginning in 2004 the FAA is expected to deploy ADS-B ground infrastructure based on ASDE-X equipment. This infrastructure will allow the use of ADS-B data for ATC purposes such as surface movement tracking/guidance and airborne surveillance.
*Ground uplinks of TIS-B and FIS-B will commence where the ground infrastructure is deployed.
*Other Civil Aviation Authorities may install ADS-B ground infrastructure and require aircraft to be equipped with ADS-B Out for operation in selected airspace. Australia is expected to be the first country to do so; however, a number of other countries with limited surveillance coverage may find ADS-B an attractive alternative to radar surveillance.
*Significant numbers of users will become equipped with a minimum of ADS-B Out capability. In Europe, 1090 MHz ES will become standard capability for all new Mode S transponder installations after 31 March, 2005. UAT will become increasingly popular in the upper end of the general aviation market.
*Airport Situational Awareness ‚Äì A combination of detailed airport maps, airport multilateration (ASDE-X) systems, enhanced aircraft displays and ADS-B have the potential to significantly improve Runway situational awareness.
*Oceanic In-trail ‚Äì ADS-B can provide enhanced situational awareness and safety for Oceanic In-trail maneuvers as additional aircraft become equipped.
*Use of ADS-B and CDTI will allow decreased approach spacing and closely spaced parallel approaches at congested airports with improved safety and capacity during low-/lower-visibility operations.

===Long-term Implementations (2012 and beyond)===
*Air carriers‚Äô fleets will achieve intended ADS-B benefits in the terminal and en route airspace.
*New Aircraft Separation Assurance applications will take advantage of the increased situational awareness and positional accuracy available in an airspace environment largely equipped with ADS-B capability.
*FIS-B and TIS-B services will encourage general aviation equipage in all market segments.

The '''Republic of Austria''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Republik √ñsterreich)'' is a [[landlocked]] country in central [[Central Europe|Europe]]. It borders [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the north, [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] to the east, [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the west.  The capital is the city of [[Vienna]].

Austria is a parliamentary [[representative democracy]] consisting of nine federal states and is one of two European countries that have declared their everlasting [[neutral country|neutrality]], the other being Switzerland. Austria is a member of the [[United Nations]] (since 1955) and the [[European Union]] (since 1995). For the first half of 2006 Austria holds the seat of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the EU]].

==Origin and history of the name==
The [[German language|German]] name ''√ñsterreich'' can be translated into [[English language|English]] as the &quot;eastern realm&quot;, which is derived from the [[Old German]] ''[[Ostarr√Æchi]]''. ''Reich'' can also mean &quot;empire&quot;, and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]/[[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], although not in the context of the modern Republic of ''√ñsterreich''. The term probably originates in a [[vernacular]] translation of the [[Medieval Latin]] name for the region: ''Marchia orientalis'', which translates as &quot;eastern border&quot;, as it was situated at the eastern edge of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], that was also mirrored in the name ''[[Ostmark]]'' applied after ''[[Anschluss]]'' to [[Germany]].

==History==
{{details|History of Austria}}

===Austria and the Holy Roman Empire===
The territory of Austria originally known as the [[Celts|Celtic]] kingdom of [[Noricum]], was a long time ally of Rome. It was occupied rather than conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during the reign of [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] and made the province Noricum  in [[16 BC]]. Later it was conquered by [[Huns]], Rugii,  [[Lombards]], [[Ostrogoth]]s, [[Bavarii]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] (until c. 800),  and [[Franks]] (in that order). Finally, after 48 years of Hungarian rule (907 to 955), the core territory of Austria was awarded to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)| Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976. Being part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the Babenbergs ruled and expanded Austria from the 10th century to the 13th century.

[[image:Juliusz Kossak Sobieski pod Wiedniem.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Battle of Vienna 1683]]

After Duke [[Frederick II]] died in 1246 and left no successor, [[Rudolf I of Habsburg]] gave the lands to his sons marking the beginning of the line of the [[Habsburg]]s, who continued to govern Austria until the 20th century.

With the short exception of [[Charles VII Albert]] of Bavaria, Austrian Habsburgs held the position of German Emperor beginning in 1438 with [[Albert II of Habsburg]] until the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the [[14th century|14th]] and 15th century Austria continued to expand its territory until it reached the position of a European imperial power at the end of the 15th century until the end of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918.

===Modern history===
Just two years before the abolition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, in 1804 the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded, which was transformed in 1867 into the dual-monarchy [[Austria-Hungary]]. The empire was split into several independent states in 1918, after the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], with most of the German-speaking parts becoming a [[republic]]. (See [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]].) Between 1918 and 1919 it was officially known as the Republic of German Austria (''Republik Deutsch√∂sterreich''). After the [[Entente]] powers forbade German Austria to unite with Germany, they also forbade the name, and then it was changed to simply Republic of Austria. The democratic republic lasted until 1933 when the chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfu√ü]] established an autocratic regime oriented towards Italian fascism ([[Austrofascism]]).

Austria became part of [[Germany]] in 1938 through the [[Anschlu√ü]] and remained under [[Nazis|Nazi]] rule until the end of [[World War II]]. After the defeat of the [[Axis Powers]], the [[Potsdam Conference|Allies occupied Austria]] until 1955, when the country became a fully independent republic under the condition that it would remain neutral (see: [[Austrian State Treaty]]). Austria also became a member of the UN in the same year. After the collapse of [[communist state]]s in [[Eastern Europe]], Austria became increasingly involved in European affairs, and in 1995, Austria joined the [[European Union]], and the [[Euro]] monetary system in 1999.

==Politics==
{{details|Politics of Austria}}
[[image:AustrianParliament.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Austrian Parliament in Vienna]]

Austria became a federal, [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentarian, democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. It was reintroduced in 1945 to the nine [[States of Austria|states]] of the Federal Republic. The [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]], who is directly elected. The chairman of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]], who is appointed by the president. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]].

The [[Parliament of Austria]] consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat is determined every four years by a free general election in which every citizen is allowed to vote to fill its 183 seats. A &quot;Four Percent Hurdle&quot; prevents a large splintering of the political landscape in the Nationalrat by awarding seats only to political parties that have obtained at least a four percent threshold of the general vote, or alternatively, have won a direct seat, or ''Direktmandat'', in one of the 43 regional election districts. The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]] has a limited right of [[veto]] (the Nationalrat can - in most cases - pass the respective bill a second time bypassing the Bundesrat altogether). A convention, called the ''√ñsterreich&amp;ndash;Konvent'' [http://www.konvent.gv.at/] was convened in [[June 30]], [[2003]] to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but has failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform. However some important parts of the final report were generally agreed upon and are still expected to be implemented.

==Subdivisions==
{{details|States of Austria}}

A federal republic, Austria is divided into nine [[states]], ([[German language|German]]: ''[[States of Austria|Bundesl√§nder]]''). These states are divided into [[district]]s (''[[Bezirke]]'') and cities (''[[Statutarstadt|Statutarst√§dte]]'').  Districts are subdivided into municipalities (''Gemeinden''). Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions, but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government.

==Geography==
{{details|Geography of Austria}}

[[image:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|left|240px|Topography of Austria]]

Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country due to its location in the [[Alps]]. The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria.  Of the total area of Austria (84,000 km¬≤ or 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 [[metre]]s (1,640&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).  The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.

[[Image:Au-map.png|thumb|right|240px|Map of Austria]]

Austria may be divided into 5 different areas.  The biggest area are the [[Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]], which constitute 62% of Austria's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the [[Alps]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]]s account for around 12% of its area.  The foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north.  Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass, and accounts for 10% of Austria.  The Austrian portion of the [[Viennese basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

===Climate===
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the [[Alps]] the [[alpine climate]] is the predominant one. In the East the climate shows continental features with less rain than the areas with high rainfall averages. 
The six highest mountains in Austria are:

==Economy==
{{details|Economy of Austria}}
[[Image:20ec_oes.png|320px|right|frame| The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere]] Palace, an example of the [[Baroque]] ]]

Austria has a well-developed [[social market economy]] and a high [[standard of living]]. Until the 1980s many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised, however in recent years privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics.

[[Germany]] has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. Slow growth in Germany and elsewhere in the world affected Austria, slowing its growth to 1.2% in 2001. But since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]] it has gained closer ties to other [[European Union]] economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to EU aspiring economies. Therefore estimates of growth in 2005 (up to 2%) are much more favourable than in the crippling German economy.

'''Agriculture''': Austrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive.

'''Industry''':  Although some industries, such as several iron and steel works and chemical plants, are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.

'''Services''': Like in other western countries, the biggest contributor to Austria's GDP is its service sector. Most notably is [[tourism]], especially [[winter]] [[tourism]].

To meet increased competition from both EU and Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, continue to deregulate the [[service sector]], and lower its tax burden.

==Demographics==
{{details|Demographics of Austria}}
[[image:1Canaletto-Wien-Belvedere.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Vienna]] during the first half of the 18th century, painting by [[Canaletto]].]]

Austria's capital [[Vienna]] is one of Europe's major cities with a population exceeding 1.6 million (2 million with suburbs) and constitutes a ''melting pot'' of citizens from all over Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to this ''Metropolis'', other cities do not exceed 1 million inhabitants, in fact the second largest [[city]] [[Graz]] is home of 305,000 people (followed by [[Linz]] with 180,000, [[Salzburg]] with 145,000 and [[Innsbruck]] with 134,803 (2005). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

Austrians of German mother tongue, by far the country's largest group, form 91.1% of Austria's population. The remaining [[number]] of Austria's people are of non-Austrian descent, many from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] are home to a significant (indigenous) Slovenian minority with around 14,000 members (Austrian census; unofficial numbers of Slovene groups speak of about 40,000). So-called guest workers ''(Gastarbeiter)'' and their descendants also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Around 20,000 [[Hungarians]] and 30,000 [[Croatians]] live in the east-most Bundesland, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of Hungary).

The official language, [[German language|German]], is spoken by almost all residents of the country. Austria's mountainous terrain led to the development of many distinct German dialects. All of the dialects in the [[country]], however, belong to [[Austro-Bavarian]] groups of German dialects, with the exception of the dialect spoken in its west-most Bundesland, [[Vorarlberg]], which belongs to the group of [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects.
There is also a distinct grammatical standard for [[Austrian language|Austrian]] German with a few differences to the German spoken in Germany.

===Politics concerning ethnic groups (Volksgruppenpolitik)===
An estimated 25,000-40,000 [[Slovenians]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] as well as Croatians and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. The Slovenians in the Austrian state of [[Styria (state)|Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of July 27, 1955 states otherwise.
The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene and Croatian speaking Austrians live alongside with the German speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. There is also an undercurrent of thinking amongst parts of the Carenthian population that the [[Slovenian]] involvement in the partisan war against the [[Nazi]] occupation force was a bad thing, and indeed &quot;Tito partisan&quot; is a not an infrequent insult hurled against members of the minority. Many Carinthians are afraid of Slovenian territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases still show parts of Carinthia as Slovenian cultural territory. The current governor, [[J√∂rg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in fall 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K√§rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.  Another interesting phenomenon is the so called &quot;Windischen-Theorie&quot; [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windischen-Theorie] stating that the Slovenians can be split in two groups: actual Slovenians and Windische, based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenians, who were taught Slovenian standard language in school and those Slovenians, who spoke their local Slovenian dialect but went to German schools. To the latter group the term &quot;Windische&quot; (originally the German word for Slovenians) was applied, claiming that they were a different ethnic group. This theory was never generally accepted and has been ultimately rejected several decades ago.

==Religion==
[[Image:Emperor_charles_v.png|thumb|right|250px|'''Charles V''' Austrian Habsburg ruler and one of the major figures within the [[Counter-Reformation]].]]

While northern and central Germany was the origin of the [[Reformation]], Austria (and Bavaria) were the heart of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th]] century, when the absolute monarchy of [[Habsburg]] imposed a strict regime to maintain [[Catholicism]]'s power and influence among Austrians. Despite this establishment of Catholicism as the predominant [[Christian]] religion (Protestants have throughout Austria's history remained a relatively small group), Austria's history as a multinational state has made it necessary for Habsburg rulers to deal with a heterogeneous religious population. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right as early as 1867 and [[Austria-Hungary]] was home of numerous religions beside [[Roman Catholicism]] such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian [[Orthodox Christians]], [[Jew]]s,  [[Muslims]] (Austria neighboured the [[Ottoman empire]] for centuries), [[Mormons]] and both [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and [[Lutheran]] [[Protestants]].

Still Austria remained largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918 First Republic Catholic leaders such as [[Theodor Innitzer]] and [[Ignaz Seipel]] took leading positions within or close to the Austrian Government and increased their influence during the time of the [[Austrofascism]] ‚Äì Catholicism was treated much like a [[state religion]] by dictators [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. Although Catholic leaders welcomed the Germans in 1938 during the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into [[Germany]], Austrian Catholicism stopped its support of [[Nazism]] later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the [[Third Reich]]. After 1945 a stricter secularism was imposed in Austria and religious influence on politics has nearly vanished.

As of the end of the 20th century about 73% of Austria's population are registered as Roman Catholic, while about 5% consider themselves [[Protestant]]s. Both these numbers have been on the decline for decades, especially Roman Catholicism, which has suffered an increasing number of seceders of the church. This is due partly to [[child sexual abuse]] scandals by priests as well as the alleged unwillingness of the Roman Catholic Church to implement reforms. In addition, Austrian Catholics are obliged to pay a mandatory tax (calculated by income ‚Äì ca 1%) to the Austrian Roman Catholic Church, which acts as another incentive to leave the church.

About 12% of the population declare that they do not belong to any [[church]] or religious community. Of the remaining people, about 180,000 are members of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Orthodox Church]] and about 7,300 are [[Judaism|Jewish]]. It has to be noted that the Austrian Jewish Community of 1938 ‚Äì Vienna alone counted more than 200,000, of which solely 4,000 to 5,000 remained after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The influx of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern Europeans]], especially from the former Yugoslav nations, Albania and particularly from [[Turkey]] largely contributed to a substantial Muslim minority in Austria ‚Äì around 300,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities. The numbers of people adhering to the [[Islam]] has increased largely during the last years and is expected to grow in the future. [[Buddhism in Austria|Buddhism]], which was legally recognized as a religion in Austria in 1983, enjoys widespread acceptance and has a following of 20,000 (10,402 at the 2001 [[census]]).
A 2005 survey among 8,000 people in various [[Europe]]an countries showed that Austrians are still among the countries with the strongest belief in [[god (monotheism)|God]]. 84% of all Austrians do state they believe in God, with only [[Poland]] (97%), [[Portugal]] (90%) and [[Russia]] (87%) in front of the countries surveyed. This is a much larger figure than the European average of 71% or [[Germany]] with 67%.

Although Austria is a small country, its history as a world power and its unique cultural environment in the heart of Europe have generated contributions to mankind in every possible field. One might argue that Austria is internationally best known for its musicians. It has been the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]], [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] or [[Gustav Mahler]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] or [[Alban Berg]].

Complementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] or [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] or [[Adalbert Stifter]]. Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Peter Handke]]. Among Austrian artists and architects one can find painters [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]] or [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]],  photographer [[Inge Morath]] or architect [[Otto Wagner]].

Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists including physicists [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schr√∂dinger]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Richard von Mises]] and [[Christian Doppler]], philosophers [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]], biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt G√∂del]]. It was home to psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]], economists [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]] ([[Austrian School]]) and [[Peter Drucker]], and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]]. 

Although Austrians can look back with pride on their cultural past, current Austria does not stand back in art and science. Austria hosts a tremendous amount of culture, with its classical music festivals in [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Bregenz]], its modern artists and writers, its theatres and opera houses.

&lt;!--PLEASE USE AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH THROUGHOUT THIS ARTICLE--&gt;
The '''Commonwealth of Australia''' is a country in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] comprising the world's smallest [[continent]] and a number of islands in the [[Southern Ocean|Southern]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Australia's neighbouring countries include [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the north, the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and the [[France|French]] dependency of [[New Caledonia]] to the northeast, and [[New Zealand]] to the southeast.

The [[Australia (continent)|continent of Australia]] has been inhabited for over 40,000 years by [[Indigenous Australians]]. After sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and by [[Europe]]an explorers and merchants starting in the 17th century, the eastern half of the continent was claimed by the [[British]] in 1770 and officially settled as the [[penal colony]] of [[New South Wales]] on [[26 January]] [[1788]]. As the population grew and new areas were explored, another five largely self-governing [[British overseas territory|British Crown Colonies]] were successively established over the course of the 19th century.

On [[1 January]] [[1901]], the six colonies [[Federation of Australia|federated]] and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed. Since federation, Australia has maintained a stable [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] political system and remains a [[Commonwealth Realm]]. The current population of around 20.4 million is concentrated mainly in the large coastal cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Adelaide]].

== Origin and history of the name ==
The name Australia is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''australis'', meaning ''southern''. Legends of an &quot;unknown southern land&quot; (''[[Terra Australis|terra australis incognita]]'') date back to the Roman times and were commonplace in mediaeval geography, but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent. The Dutch adjectival form ''Australische'' (&quot;Australian&quot;, in the sense of &quot;southern&quot;) was used by Dutch officials in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as 1638. The first use of the word &quot;Australia&quot; in [[English language|English]] was a 1693 translation of ''Les Aventures de Jacques Sadeur dans la D√©couverte et le Voyage de la Terre Australe'', a 1692 French novel by [[Gabriel de Foigny]] under the pen name Jacques Sadeur {{ref|Baker}}. &lt;!-- there was a 1676 version, but it was suppressed --&gt;  [[Alexander Dalrymple]] then used it in ''An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean'', published in 1771. He used the term to refer to the entire South Pacific region, not specifically to the Australian continent. In 1793, [[George Shaw]] and [[James Edward Smith|Sir James Smith]] published ''Zoology and Botany of New Holland'', in which they wrote of &quot;the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]].&quot;
[[Image:Flinders View of Port Jackson taken from South Head.jpg|200px|thumb|left|View of [[Port Jackson]], taken from the South Head, from ''A Voyage to Terra Australis''. [[Sydney]] was established on this site.]]
The name &quot;Australia&quot; was popularised by the 1814 work ''A Voyage to Terra Australis'' by the navigator [[Matthew Flinders]]. Despite its title, which reflected the view of the Admiralty, Flinders used the word &quot;Australia&quot; in the book, which was widely read and gave the term general currency. Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] of [[New South Wales]] subsequently used the word in his dispatches to [[England]]. In 1817 he recommended that it be officially adopted. In 1824, the British Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia.

The word &quot;Australia&quot; in [[Australian English]] is [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] as either {{IPA|/…ô.Ààst…π√¶…™.lj…ô/}}, {{IPA|/…ô.Ààst…π√¶…™.liÀê.…ô/}} or {{IPA|/…ô.Ààst…π√¶…™.j…ô/}}.

== History ==
{{main|History of Australia}}
The first human habitation of Australia is estimated to have occurred between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago.{{ref|Gillespie2002}} The first Australians were the ancestors of the current [[Indigenous Australians]]; they arrived via land bridges and short sea-crossings from present-day [[Southeast Asia]]. Most of these people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. The [[Torres Strait Islanders]], ethnically [[Melanesia]]n, inhabited the [[Torres Strait Islands]] and parts of far-north [[Queensland]]; they possess distinct cultural practices from the Aborigines.
[[Image:Endeavour replica in Cooktown harbour.jpg|240px|left|thumb|Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the East coast of Australia on [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']], claiming the land for Britain in 1770. This replica was built in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] in 1988 for Australia's bicentenary.]]
The first undisputed recorded European sighting of the Australian continent was made by the Dutch navigator [[Willem Jansz]], who sighted the coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in 1606. During the 17th century, the Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines of what they called [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], but made no attempt at settlement. In 1770, [[James Cook]] sailed along and mapped the east coast of Australia, which he named [[New South Wales]] and claimed for Britain. The expedition's discoveries provided impetus for the establishment of a [[penal colony]] there following the loss of the American colonies that had previously filled that role.
[[Image:Port Arthur Seeseite.jpg|260px|thumb|right|[[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]], [[Tasmania]] was Australia's largest penal colony.]]
The British [[British overseas territory|Crown Colony]] of New South Wales started with the establishment of a settlement at [[Port Jackson]] by Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] on [[26 January]] [[1788]]. This date was later to become Australia's national day, [[Australia Day]]. [[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825. The United Kingdom formally claimed the western part of Australia in 1829. Separate colonies were created from parts of New South Wales: [[South Australia]] in 1836, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1851, and [[Queensland]] in 1859. The [[Northern Territory]] (NT) was founded in 1863 as part of the Province of South Australia. Victoria and South Australia were founded as &quot;free colonies&quot; ‚Äî that is, they were never penal colonies, although the former did receive some convicts from Tasmania. Western Australia was also founded &quot;free&quot;, but later accepted transported convicts due to an acute labour shortage. The transportation of convicts to Australia was phased out between 1840 and 1868.

The [[Indigenous Australian]] population, estimated at about 350,000 at the time of European settlement,{{ref|Smith1980}} declined steeply for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease, forced migration, the [[Stolen Generation|removal of children]], and other colonial government policies that some historians and Indigenous Australians have argued could be considered tantamount to [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|genocide]] by today's understanding.{{ref|Tatz1999}} Such interpretations of Aboriginal history are disputed by some as being exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons.{{ref|wind2001}} {{ref|smh2002}} This debate is known within Australia as the [[History Wars]]. Following the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], the Federal government gained the power to implement policies and make laws with respect to Aborigines. Traditional ownership of land ‚Äî [[native title]] ‚Äî was not recognised until the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' overturned the notion of Australia as ''[[terra nullius]]'' at the time of European occupation.
[[Image:Anzac1.JPG|left|thumb|240px|The [[Last Post]] is played at an [[ANZAC Day]] ceremony in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]], [[25 April]] [[2005]]. Ceremonies such as this are held in virtually every suburb and town in Australia.]] 
A [[gold rush]] began in Australia in the early 1850s, and the [[Eureka Stockade]] rebellion in 1854 was an early expression of nationalist sentiment. Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained [[responsible government]], managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the [[British Empire]]. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs, defence and international shipping. On [[1 January]] [[1901]], [[Federation of Australia|federation]] of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, consultation and voting, and the Commonwealth of Australia was born, as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) was formed from New South Wales in 1911 to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of [[Canberra]] ([[Melbourne]] was the capital from 1901 to 1927). The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth in 1911. Australia willingly participated in [[World War I]];{{ref|Bean1941}} many Australians regard the defeat of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] as the birth of the nation ‚Äî its first major military action. The Gallipoli campaign is often erroneously portrayed as or conceived to have been a solely or mainly ANZAC campaign. The reality was that British deaths during the campaign were twice as high as those of ANZAC forces. Much like Gallipoli, the [[Kokoda Track Campaign]] is regarded by many as a nation-defining battle from [[World War II]].

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom, but Australia did not [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|adopt the Statute]] until 1942. The shock of the United Kingdom's defeat in Asia in 1942 and the threat of Japanese invasion caused Australia to turn to the [[United States]] as a new ally and protector. Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the US under the auspices of the [[ANZUS]] treaty. After World War II, Australia encouraged mass immigration from Europe; since the 1970s and the abolition of the [[White Australia policy]], immigration from Asia and other parts of the world was also encouraged. As a result, Australia's demography, culture and image of itself were radically transformed. The final constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom ended in 1986 with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986]], ending any British role in the Australian States, and ending judicial appeals to the UK Privy Council. Australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in 1999 by a 55% majority,{{ref|AEC}} but the result is generally viewed in terms of dissatisfaction with the specifics of the proposed republican model rather than attachment to the monarchy. Since the election of the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam Government]] in 1972, there has been an increasing focus on the nation's future as a part of the Asia-Pacific region.

==Politics==
{{main articles|[[Government of Australia]] and [[Politics of Australia]]}}
[[Image:NewParliamentHouseInCanberra.jpg|thumb|right|240px|New [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]] was opened in 1988 replacing the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|provisional Parliament House building]] opened in 1927.]]

The Commonwealth of Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and has a [[parliamentary system]] of government. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[Queen of Australia]], a role that is distinct from her position as Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The Queen is nominally represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]; although the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] gives extensive [[Executive (government)|executive powers]] to the Governor-General, these are normally exercised only on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. The most notable exercise of the Governor-General's [[reserve power]]s outside the Prime Minister's direction was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|constitutional crisis of 1975]].{{ref|PL1997}}

There are three branches of government.
*The legislature: the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]], comprising the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Representatives; the Queen is represented by the Governor-General, who in practice exercises little or no power over the Parliament.
*The executive: the [[Federal Executive Council]] (the Governor-General as advised by the executive councillors); in practice, the councillors are the prime minister and ministers of state, whose advice the Governor-General accepts, with rare exceptions.
*The judiciary: the [[High Court of Australia]] and other [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. The State courts became formally independent from the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] when the ''[[Australia Act]]'' was passed in 1986.

The [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] Commonwealth Parliament consists of the Queen, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] (the upper house) of 76 senators, and a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (the lower house) of 150 members. Members of the lower house are elected from single-member constituencies, commonly known as 'electorates' or 'seats'. Seats in the House of Representatives are allocated to states on the basis of population. In the Senate, each state, regardless of population, is represented by 12 senators, with the ACT and the NT each electing two. Elections for both chambers are held every three years; typically only half of the Senate seats are put to each election, because senators have overlapping six-year terms.  The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms Government, with its leader becoming Prime Minister.

There are three major political parties: the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]]. Independent members and several minor parties ‚Äî including the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], [[Family First Party|Family First]] and the [[Australian Democrats]] ‚Äî have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses, although their influence has been marginal. Since the [[Australian legislative election, 1996|1996 election]], the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]] led by the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], has been in power in Canberra. In the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]], the Coalition won control of the Senate, the first time that a party (or coalition of governing parties) has done so while in government in more than 20 years. The Labor Party is in power in every state and territory.  [[Compulsory voting|Voting is compulsory]] in each state and territory and at the federal level.

== States and territories==
{{main|States and territories of Australia}}
[[Image:Map of Australia.png|thumb|240px|States and territories of Australia]]
Australia consists of six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]].
In most respects, the territories function similarly to the states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments. By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only with respect to certain areas as set out in [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|Section 51]] of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]]; all residual legislative powers are retained by the state parliaments, including powers over hospitals, education, police, the judiciary, roads, public transport and local government. 

Each state and territory has its own [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|legislature]] ([[Unicameralism|unicameral]] in the case of the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the remaining states). The [[lower house]] is known as the [[Legislative Assembly]] ([[House of Assembly]] in South Australia and Tasmania) and the [[upper house]] the [[Legislative Council]]. The [[head of government|heads of the governments]] in each state and territory are called [[Premiers of the Australian states|premiers]] and [[Chief Minister|chief ministers]], respectively. The Queen is represented in each state by a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]]; an [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]] in the Northern Territory, and the Governor-General in the ACT, have analogous roles.

Australia also has several minor territories; the federal government administers a separate area within New South Wales, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], as a naval base and sea port for the national capital. In addition Australia has the following, inhabited, external territories: [[Norfolk Island]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and several largely uninhabited external territories: [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]].

==Foreign relations and military==
{{main articles|[[Foreign relations of Australia]] and [[Australian Defence Force]]}}

Over recent decades, [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's foreign relations]] have been driven by a close association with the [[United States]], through the [[ANZUS|ANZUS pact]] and by a desire to develop relationships with [[Asia]] and the Pacific, particularly through [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the [[East Asia Summit]] following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Australia is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], in which the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] meetings provide the main forum for co-operation. Much of Australia's diplomatic energy is focused on international trade liberalisation. Australia led the formation of the [[Cairns Group]] and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and is a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and the [[WTO]]. Australia has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement|Australia-US Free Trade Agreement]]. Australia is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 2005‚Äì06 budget provides A$2.5&amp;nbsp;bn for development assistance;{{ref|AGov2005}} as a percentage of GDP, this contribution is less than that of the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. 

Australia's armed forces ‚Äî the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) ‚Äî comprise the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), the [[Australian Army]], and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). All branches of the ADF have been involved in UN and regional peacekeeping (most recently in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and [[Sudan]]), disaster relief, and armed conflict, including the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. The government appoints the chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services; the current chief is Air Chief Marshal [[Angus Houston]]. In 2005‚Äì06, the defence budget is A$17.5&amp;nbsp;bn.{{ref_label|AGov2005|8|a}}

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Australia}}
[[Image:Australia-climate-map_MJC01.png|thumb|250px|Climate map of Australia]]
Australia's 7,686,850 [[square kilometre]]s (2,967,909 [[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) landmass is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. Surrounded by the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans, Australia is separated from Asia by the [[Arafura Sea|Arafura]] and [[Timor Sea|Timor]] seas. Australia has a total 25,760 [[kilometre]]s (16,007&amp;nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of coastline and claims an extensive [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,057&amp;nbsp;sq.&amp;nbsp;mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]. 

The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000 kilometres (1,250&amp;nbsp;mi). The world's two largest monoliths are located in Australia, Mount Augustus in Western Australia is the largest and Uluru in central Australia is the second largest. At 2,228 [[metre]]s (7,310 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), Mount Kosciuszko on the Great Dividing Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland, although Mawson Peak on the remote Australian territory of Heard Island is taller at 2,745 metres (9,006&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

==Climate==
The largest part of Australia is [[desert]] or [[semi-arid]] ‚Äì 40% of the landmass is covered by [[sand dune]]s. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate: part is tropical [[rainforest]]s, part grasslands, and very little desert. Australia receives [[snowfall]] in some cities, but mostly in towns and at higher evaluations. Climate is highly influenced by ocean currents, including the [[El Ni√±o]] southern oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia. Rainfall is highly variable, with frequent [[drought]]s. Rising levels of [[salinity]] and desertification in some areas. 

Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore has no active volcanism only extinct volcanos, although it may sometimes receive minor earthquakes. The terrain is mostly heavily weathered, low [[plateau]] with deserts, rangelands and a fertile plain in southeast.  Tasmania and the [[Australian Alps]] do not contain any permanent [[icefield]]s or [[glacier]]s, although they may have existed in the past. The [[Great Barrier Reef]], by far the world's largest [[coral]] [[reef]], lies a short distance off the north-east coast. [[Mount Augustus National Park|Mount Augustus]], in [[Western Australia]], is the largest [[monolith]] in the world.

== Flora and fauna ==
{{main articles|[[Flora of Australia]] and [[Fauna of Australia]]}}
[[Image:Koala climbing tree.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The [[Koala]] and the ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' make an iconic pair of Australian flora and fauna.]]
Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it covers a diverse range of habitats, from alpine heaths to tropical [[rainforest]]s. Because of the great age and consequent low levels of fertility of the continent, its extremely variable weather patterns and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is unique and [[biodiversity|diverse]]. About 85% of [[flowering plant]]s, 84% of [[mammal]]s, more than 45% of [[List of Australian birds|bird]]s, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]].{{ref|DEH}} Many of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and [[Invasive species in Australia|introduced plant and animal species]]. The federal ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' is a legal framework used for the protection of threatened species. Numerous [[Protected areas of Australia|protected areas]] have been created to protect and preserve Australia's unique ecosystems, 64 wetlands are registered under the [[Ramsar Convention]], and 16 [[World Heritage Site]]s have been established. Australia was ranked 13th in the World on the 2005 [[Environmental Sustainability Index]].

Most Australian plant species are evergreen and many are adapted to fire and drought, including the [[Eucalyptus|eucalyptus]] and [[acacia]]s. Australia has a rich variety of endemic [[legume]] species that thrive in nutrient-poor soils because of their symbiosis with [[Rhizobia]] bacteria and [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal]] fungi. Well-known Australian fauna include [[monotreme]]s (the [[platypus]] and [[echidna]]); a host of [[marsupial]]s, including the [[koala]], [[kangaroo]], [[wombat]]; and birds such as the [[emu]], [[cockatoo]], and [[kookaburra]]. The [[dingo]] was introduced by Austronesian people that traded with Indigenous Australians around 4000 [[Common Era|BCE]]. Many plant and animal species became extinct soon after human settlement, including the [[Australian megafauna]]; many more have become extinct since European settlement, among them the [[Thylacine]] (Tasmanian Tiger).

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Australia}}
[[Image:Melbourne yarra afternoon.jpg|240px|thumb|right| [[Melbourne]]'s population is approximately 3.7 million, the second largest in Australia]]
Australia has a prosperous, Western-style [[mixed economy]], with a per capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] slightly higher than those of the UK, [[Germany]] and [[France]]. The country was ranked third in the [[United Nations]]' 2005 [[Human Development Index]] and sixth in ''[[The Economist]]'' worldwide quality-of-life index 2005. In recent years, the Australian economy has been resilient in the face of global economic downturn. Rising output in the domestic economy has been offsetting the global slump, and business and consumer confidence remains robust. Australia's emphasis on economic reform is often claimed to be key factor behind the economy's strength. In the 1980s, the Labor Party, led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]], started the process of economic reform by [[Floating exchange rate|floating]] the [[Australian dollar]] in 1983, and deregulating the financial system.{{ref|Macfarlane1998}} Since 1996, the Howard government has continued the process of micro-economic reform, including the partial deregulation of the labour market and the privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the [[Communications in Australia|telecommunications]] industry.{{ref|Parham2002}} Substantial reform of the indirect tax system was implemented in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]], which has slightly reduced the heavy reliance on personal and company income tax that still characterises Australia's tax system.

The Australian economy has not suffered a [[recession]] since the early 1990s. As of January 2006, [[unemployment]] was 5.3% with 10,034,500 persons employed.{{ref|ABS6202}} The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, comprises 69% of GDP.{{ref|DFAT}} [[Agriculture in Australia|Agriculture]] and natural-resources represent only 3% and 5% of GDP, respectively, but contribute substantially to Australia's export performance. Australia's largest export markets include [[Japan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], the United States, [[South Korea]] and New Zealand.{{ref|ABS2005}} Areas of concern to some economists include the chronically high [[current account deficit]] and also high levels of net foreign debt.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Australia}}
[[Image:Sydney_opera_house_and_skyline.jpg|thumb|259px|right|Most Australians live in urban areas; [[Sydney]] is the most populous city in Australia.]]

Most of the estimated 20.4 million Australians are descended from 19th- and 20th-century immigrants, the majority from [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. Australia's population has quadrupled since the end of World War I {{ref|ABS}}, spurred by an ambitious [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] program. In 2001, the five largest groups of the 27.4% of Australians who were born overseas were from the United Kingdom, [[New Zealand]], [[Italy]], [[Vietnam]] and China.{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|a}} Following the abolition of the [[White Australia policy]] in [[1973]], numerous government initiatives have been established to encourage and promote racial harmony based on a policy of [[multiculturalism]]{{ref|DIMIA}}. Australia‚Äôs population has increased by about 60 times since European settlement.

The self-declared indigenous population ‚Äî including Torres Strait Islanders, who are of Melanesian descent ‚Äî was 410,003 (2.2% of the total population) in 2001, a significant increase from the 1977 census, which showed an indigenous population of 115,953.{{ref|ABS2001}} Indigenous Australians have higher rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are 17 years lower than those of other Australians.{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|b}} Perceived racial inequality is an ongoing political and [[human rights in Australia|human rights]] issue for Australians.

[[Image:Tanunda.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Fewer than 15% of Australians live in rural areas. This picture shows the [[Barossa Valley]] wine producing region of [[South Australia]].]]

In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. A large number of Australians (759,849 for the period 2002&amp;ndash;03{{ref|PoA2005}}) live outside their home country. Australia has maintained one of the most active [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] programs in the world to boost population growth. Most immigrants are skilled; the quota includes categories for family members and [[refugee]]s. 

[[English language|English]] is the [[official language]],{{ref|DIMIA2}} and is spoken and written in a distinct variety known as [[Australian English]]. According to the 2001 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (2.1%), [[Italian language|Italian]] (1.9%) and [[Greek language|Greek]] (1.4%). A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are [[Multilingual|bilingual]]. It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] at the time of first European contact.  Only about 70 of these languages have survived, and all but 20 of these are now [[endangered languages|endangered]]. An indigenous language remains the main language for about 50,000 (0.02%) people. Australia has a [[sign language]] known as [[Auslan]], which is the main language of about 6,500 [[deaf]] people.

Australia has no [[state religion]].  The 2001 census identified that 68% of Australians call themselves Christian: 27% identifying themselves as [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Roman Catholic]] and 21% as [[Anglican Church|Anglican]]. Australians that identify themselves as followers of non-Christian religions number 5%. A total of 16% were categorised as having &quot;No Religion&quot; (which includes non theistic beliefs such as [[secular humanism|Humanism]], [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[rationalism]]) and a further 12% declined to answer or did not give a response adequate for interpretation. As in many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is about 1.5 million, about 7.5% of the population.{{ref|NCLSattsurvey}}

School attendance is compulsory throughout Australia between the ages of 6&amp;ndash;15 years (16 years in South Australia and Tasmania), contributing to an adult literacy rate that is assumed to be 99%. Government grants have supported the establishment of Australia's 38 universities, and although several private universities have been established, the majority receive government funding. There is a state-based system of vocational training colleges, known as [[Technical and Further Education|TAFE Institutes]], and many trades conduct [[apprenticeship]]s for training new tradespeople. Approximately 58% of Australians between the ages of 25 and 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications.{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|c}}

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Australia}}
[[Image:Golden Summer Eaglemont Arthur Streeton.jpg|right|thumb|240px|''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' ([[Eaglemont, Victoria]]) by [[Arthur Streeton]] (1889) is an early example of the rich tradition of Australian [[landscape painting]].]]
The primary basis of Australian culture up until the mid-20th century was [[Anglo-Celtic]], although distinctive Australian features had been evolving from the environment and [[Australian Aborigine|indigenous]] culture. Over the past 50 years, Australian culture has been strongly influenced by American popular culture (particularly television and cinema), large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking countries, and Australia's Asian neighbours.  The vigour and originality of the arts in Australia‚Äîfilms, opera, music, painting, theater, dance, and crafts‚Äîare achieving international recognition.

Australia has a long history of visual arts, starting with the [[Cave painting|cave]] and bark paintings of its indigenous peoples. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in [[Art of Australia|Australian art]] has been the Australian landscape, seen in the works of [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Albert Namatjira]], among others. The traditions of indigenous Australians are largely transmitted orally and are closely tied to ceremony and the telling of the stories of the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. [[Australian Aboriginal music]], dance and [[Australian Aboriginal art|art]] have a palpable influence on contemporary Australian visual and performing arts. Australia has an active tradition of [[music]], [[ballet]] and [[theatre]]; many of its performing arts companies receive public funding through the federal government's [[The Australia Council|Australia Council]]. There is a [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] in each capital city, and a national [[opera]] company, [[Opera Australia]], first made prominent by the renowned diva [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]]; [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] includes classical, jazz, and many popular music genres.

[[Australian literature]] has also been influenced by the landscape; the works of writers such as [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] captured the experience of the Australian bush. The character of colonial Australia, as embodied in early literature, resonates with modern Australia and its perceived emphasis on [[egalitarianism]], mateship, and anti-authoritarianism. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the 20th century. [[Australian English]] is a major variety of the language; its grammar and spelling are largely based on those of British English, overlaid with a rich vernacular of unique lexical items and phrases, some of which have found their way into standard English.

Australia has two public broadcasters (the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]), three commercial [[television network]]s, three pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. [[Cinema of Australia|Australia's film industry]] has achieved critical and commercial successes. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''. According to [[Reporters Without Borders]] in 2005, Australia is in 31st position on a list of countries ranked by [[freedom of the press|press freedom]], behind [[New Zealand]] (9th)  and the [[United Kingdom]] (28th) but ahead of the [[United States]]. This ranking is primarily due to the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia. Most Australian [[Publishing|print media]] in particular is under the control of either [[News Corporation]] or [[John Fairfax Holdings]].
[[Image:Aussie rules wikipedia.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Australian rules football]] was developed in [[Melbourne]], Australia and is played at amateur and professional levels.]]

[[Sport in Australia|Sport]] is an important part of Australian culture, assisted by a climate that favours outdoor activities; 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|d}}. At an international level, Australia has particularly strong teams in [[cricket]], [[field hockey|hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]] and [[swimming]]. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] of the modern era, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] Summer Olympics, and has ranked among the top five medal-takers since 2000. In [[2004]], it collected 49 Olympic medals (17 gold, 16 silver and 16 bronze). Australia has also hosted the [[1938 British Empire Games|1938]], [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962]] and [[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982]] Commonwealth Games, and will host the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]]. [[Australian rules football]] is the most popular national sport; players gain some international prominence through [[International rules football|International Rules]] which is an annual meeting between the Australian code and Irish Gaelic Football. However, [[Rugby League]] is more popular than Australian Rules in New South Wales and Queensland. The [[Australian Open]] is one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, held in [[Melbourne]] each January. The F1 [[Australian Grand Prix]] is also held in Melbourne, usually towards the end of March each year. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and √©lite athletes is common in Australia. 

Televised sport is popular; some of the highest rating television programs include the summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.{{ref|AFC}}

'''American Samoa''' ([[Samoan language|Samoan]]: '''Amerika Samoa''') is an [[unorganized territory|unorganized]], [[incorporated territory|unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]] located in the South [[Pacific Ocean]] southeast of the sovereign state of [[Samoa]].  The main (largest and most populous) island is [[Tutuila]], with the {{Unicode|[[Manua|Manu'a]]}} Islands, [[Rose Atoll]], and [[Swains Island]] also included in the territory. American Samoa is part of the Samoan Islands chain, located west of the [[Cook Islands]], north of [[Tonga]], and some 300 [[mile]]s (500 km) south of [[Tokelau]]. To the west are the islands of the [[Wallis and Futuna]] group.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Samoa]], [[History of American Samoa]]''

Originally inhabited as early as [[1000 BC]], Samoa was not reached by [[Europe]]an explorers until the [[18th century]].

International rivalries in the latter half of the [[19th century]] were settled by an [[1899]] [[Treaty of Berlin, 1899|Treaty of Berlin]] in which [[Germany]] and the U.S. divided the Samoan [[archipelago]]. The U.S. formally occupied its portion‚Äîa smaller group of eastern islands with the noted harbor of [[Pago Pago, American Samoa|Pago Pago]]‚Äîthe following year. The western islands are now the independent state of [[Samoa]]. 

After the U.S. took possession of American Samoa, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] built a [[coal|coaling]] station on Pago Pago Bay for its Pacific Squadron and appointed a local Secretary. The navy secured a Deed of Cession of Tutuila in [[1900]] and a Deed of Cession of {{Unicode|[[Manua|Manu ªa]]}} in [[1904]]. The last sovereign of {{Unicode|Manu ªa}}, the {{Unicode|[[Tui Manua Elisala|Tui Manu ªa Elisala]]}}, was forced to sign a Deed of Cession of {{Unicode|Manu ªa}} following a series of US Naval trials, known as the &quot;Trial of the Ipu&quot;, in Pago Pago, {{Unicode|Ta ªu}}, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat.

During [[World War II]], U.S. Marines in American Samoa outnumbered the local population, having a huge cultural influence. After the war, Organic Act 4500, a U.S. [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]]-sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was defeated in Congress, primarily through the efforts of American Samoan chiefs, led by [[Tuiasosopo Mariota]].  These chiefs' efforts led to the creation of a local legislature, the American Samoa ''Fono,'' which meets in the village of [[Fagatogo]], the territory's ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' capital.  (See the Trivia section below for more information on Fagatogo.)

In time, the Navy-appointed governor was replaced by a locally elected one.  Although technically considered &quot;unorganized&quot; in that the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] has not passed an [[Organic Act]] for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a constitution that became effective on [[July 1]], [[1967]].  The U.S. Territory of American Samoa is on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], a listing which is disputed by territorial government officials.

==Administrative Divisions==
American Samoa is administratively divided into 3 [[district]]s and 2 &quot;unorganized&quot; islands. These districts are subdivided into 73 villages. 
Districts:
* Eastern 
* Western 
* Manu'a 

Unorganized Islands:
*[[Rose Atoll|Rose Island]]
*[[Swains Island|Swains Island]]

==Trivia==
* American Samoa is the location of [[Rose Atoll]], the southernmost point in the United States (if [[insular area]]s and territories are included); see [[Extreme Points of the United States|extreme points]] for more information).
* About 30 ethnic Samoans, many from American Samoa, currently play in the [[National Football League]]. A 2002 article from [http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2002/0527/1387626.html ESPN] estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the 50 United States) is 40 times more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American. A number have also ventured into professional wrestling (see especially [[:Category:Anoai wrestling family|Anoai wrestling family]]).
* Persons born in American Samoa are United States [[nationality|national]]s, but not United States [[citizen]]s. This is the only circumstance under which an individual would be one and not the other.
* The [[American Samoa national soccer team]] holds an unwanted world record in international [[football (soccer)|soccer]]‚Äîthe record defeat in an international match, a 31-0 crushing by [[Australia national football team|Australia]] on [[April 11]], [[2001]].
* Although many respected reference sources list the neighboring village of [[Pago Pago]] as the capital, [[Fagatogo]] is the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' (i.e., constitutionally designated; cf. Article 5, Section 9) seat of government.  Additionally, the governor's office is located in the village of Utulei, located on the opposite side of Fagatogo from Pago Pago.  The reason why many sources list Pago Pago is because the name Pago Pago, the most popular port of call in American Samoa, has become associated with the harbor itself; thus Pago Pago is now generally applied to the harbor area and the capital.  However, both the port itself and the legislature of American Samoa‚Äîknown as the Fono‚Äîare located in Fagatogo, a village that is adjacent to (and for all practical purposes indistinguishable from) Pago Pago.  (Cf. Wikipedia entry for [[Pago Pago]].)
*In March of 1889, a [[Germany|German]] naval force shelled a village in [[Samoa]], and by doing so destroyed some [[United States|American]] property. Three American warships then entered the [[Samoan]] harbor and were prepared to fire on the three German warships found there. Before guns were fired, a hurricane blew up and sank all the ships, American and German. A compulsory [[armistice]] was called because of the lack of warships.

Astronomy is generally thought to have begun in [[ancient history|ancient]] [[Babylon]] by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]] priests (the ''[[magi]]''). Recent studies of Babylonian records have shown them to be extremely accurate for the ancient night sky. Following the Babylonians, the [[Egypt]]ians also had an emphasis on observations of the sky.

Mixtures of religious interpretations of the sky and the development of complex models for applying these interpretations, led to a [[duality]] that we now identify as [[astrology]]. It is important to recognize that before about [[1750]], there was no distinction between [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]].

Astronomers, unlike most scientists, cannot interact with the objects that they study. They instead must resort to detailed [[observation]] in order to make discoveries. Generally, astronomers use [[telescope|telescopes]] or other imaging equipment to make such observations. The job itself is involved with travel to remote locations to study as well.

There is also a well-known painting by [[Johannes Vermeer]] titled ''The Astronomer'', which is often linked to Vermeer's ''The [[Geographer]]''. These paintings are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific inquiry in [[Europe]] at the time of their painting, [[1668]]-[[1669|69]].

'''Amoeboids''' are [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that move or feed by means of temporary projections, called [[pseudopod]]s (false feet).  They have appeared in a number of different groups.  Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance our [[white blood cell]]s, which consume pathogens.  Many [[protist]]s exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle.  The most famous such organism is ''[[Amoeba|Amoeba proteus]]''; the name amoebae is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

Amoeboids may be divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of the pseudopods.  Those where the pseudopods are supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s are called actinopods, and forms where they are not are called rhizopods, further divided into lobse, filose, and reticulose amoebae.  There is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the [[xenophyophore]]s, that do not fall into any of these categories.

* Lobose pseudopods are blunt, and there may be one or several on a cell, which is usually divided into a layer of clear ectoplasm surrounding more granular endoplasm.  Most, including ''Amoeba'' itself, move by the body mass flowing into an anterior pseudopod.  The vast majority form a monophyletic group called the [[Amoebozoa]], which also includes most [[slime mould]]s.  A second group, the [[Percolozoa]], includes protists that can transform between amoeboid and [[flagellate]] forms.

* Filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering.  The vast majority of filose amoebae, including all those that produce shells, are placed within the [[Cercozoa]] together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid forms.  The naked filose amoebae comprise two other groups, the [[vampyrellid]]s and [[nucleariid]]s.  The latter appear to be close relatives of [[animal]]s and [[fungus|fungi]].

* Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net.  They are found most notably among the [[Foraminifera]], a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells.  There are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids, notably the [[gymnophryid]]s, and their relationships are not certain.

* Actinopods are divided into the [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]].  The radiolaria are mostly marine protists with complex internal skeletons, including central capsules that divide the cells into granular endoplasm and frothy ectoplasm that keeps them buoyant.  The heliozoa include both freshwater and marine forms that use their axopods to capture small prey, and only have simple scales or spines for skeletal elements.  Both groups appear to be [[polyphyletic]].

Traditionally the amoeboid protozoa are grouped together as the Sarcodina, variously ranked from class to phylum, with each of the above categories as a formal subtaxon.  However, since they are all based on form rather than phylogeny, newer systems generally separate some out or abandon them entirely.  Most amoeboids are now included in two major supergroups - the [[Amoebozoa]], including most lobose amoebae and slime moulds, and the [[Rhizaria]], including the Cercozoa, Foraminifera, radiolarian classes and certain heliozoa.  However, amoeboids have appeared separately in many other groups, including various different lines of algae not listed above.

[[Image:ascii_full.png|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]]
'''ASCII''' ('''''A'''merican '''S'''tandard '''C'''ode for '''I'''nformation '''I'''nterchange''), generally [[IPA for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[&amp;#712;√¶ski]}}, is a [[character encoding]] based on the [[English alphabet]]. ASCII codes represent [[character (computing)|text]] in [[computer]]s, [[telecommunications|communications]] equipment, and other devices that work with text. Most modern character encodings have a historical basis in ASCII.

ASCII was first published as a standard in 1967 and was last updated in 1986. It currently defines codes for 33 non-printing, mostly obsolete [[control character]]s that affect how text is processed, plus the following 95 printable characters (starting with the space character):

&lt;pre&gt;
 !&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Asteroid [[3568 ASCII]] is named after the character encoding.

==Overview==
Like other character representation computer [[code]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and the symbols/[[glyph]]s of a written language, thus allowing [[digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information. The ASCII character encoding&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization ([[December 1]], [[1975]]). &quot;[http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/001.pdf The set of control characters for ISO 646]&quot;. ''Internet Assigned Numbers Authority Registry''. Alternate U.S. version: [http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/006.pdf]. Accessed [[August 7]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;‚Äî or a compatible extension (see below)&amp;nbsp;‚Äî is used on nearly all common computers, especially [[personal computer]]s and [[workstation]]s. The preferred [[MIME]] name for this encoding is &quot;US-ASCII&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ([[January 28]], [[2005]]). &quot;[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets Character Sets]&quot;. Accessed [[August 7]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCII is, strictly, a seven-[[bit]] code, meaning that it uses the bit patterns representable with seven binary digits (a range of 0 to 127 decimal) to represent character information. At the time ASCII was introduced, many computers dealt with eight-bit groups ([[byte]]s or, more specifically, [[octet (computing)|octet]]s) as the smallest unit of information; the eighth bit was commonly used as a [[parity bit]] for error checking on communication lines or other device-specific functions. Machines which did not use parity typically set the eighth bit to zero, though some systems such as [[Prime computer|Prime]] machines running [[PRIMOS]] set the eighth bit of ASCII characters to one.

ASCII only defines a relationship between specific characters and bit sequences; aside from reserving a few control codes for line-oriented formatting, it does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Such concepts are within the realm of other systems such as the [[markup language]]s.

==History==
ASCII developed from [[Telegraphy|telegraphic codes]] and first entered commercial use as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by [[AT&amp;T|Bell]] data services. The [[Bell System]] had previously planned to use a six-bit code, derived from [[Fieldata]], that added punctuation and lower-case letters to the earlier five-bit [[Baudot code|Baudot]] teleprinter code, but was persuaded instead to join the [[American National Standards Institute|ASA]] subcommittee that had started to develop ASCII. Baudot helped in the automation of sending and receiving telegraphic messages, and took many features from [[Morse code]]; however, unlike Morse code, Baudot used constant-length codes. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII both underwent re-ordering for more convenient sorting (especially alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the '[[escape sequence]]'.

The American Standards Association (ASA, later to become [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) first published ASCII as a standard in 1963. ASCII-1963 lacked the lowercase letters, and had an up-arrow (&amp;#8593;) instead of the caret (^) and a left-arrow (&amp;#8592;) instead of the underscore (_). The 1967 version added the lowercase letters, changed the names of a few control characters and moved the two controls ACK and ESC from the lowercase letters area into the control codes area.

ASCII was subsequently updated and published as ANSI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII. These encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, even though ASCII is strictly defined only by the ASA/ANSI standards:

* The [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]] published editions of its ASCII clone, ECMA-6, in 1965, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1983, and 1991. The 1991 edition is the same as ANSI X3.4-1986.&lt;ref&gt;ECMA International (December 1991). [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-006.pdf Standard ECMA-6: 7-bit Coded Character Set, 6th edition.] Accessed [[December 17]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[International Organization for Standardization]] published its version, ISO 646 (later [[ISO/IEC 646]]) in 1967, 1972, 1983, and 1991. ISO 646:1972, in particular, established a set of country-specific versions with punctuation characters replaced with non-English letters. ISO/IEC 646:1991 International Reference Version is the same as ANSI X3.4-1986.
* The [[International Telecommunication Union]] published its version of ANSI X3.4-1986, [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]] Recommendation T.50, in 1992. In the early 1970s, under the name CCITT, the same organization published a version as CCITT Recommendation V.3.
* [[DIN]] published a version of ASCII as DIN 66003 in 1974.
* The [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] published a version in 1969 as RFC 20, and established the Internet's standard version, based on ANSI X3.4-1986, with the publication of RFC 1345 in 1992.
* [[IBM]]'s version of ANSI X3.4-1986 is published in IBM technical literature as [[code page 367]].

ASCII has also become embedded in its probable replacement, [[Unicode]], as the 'lowest' 128 characters. Some observers consider ASCII the most &quot;successful&quot; software standard ever promulgated.

==ASCII control characters==
ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0‚Äì31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to carry printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII. For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 27 represents the &quot;escape&quot; key often found in the top left corner of common [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s.

Code 127 (all seven bits on), another special character, equates to &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;rubout&quot;. Though its function resembles that of other control characters, the designers of ASCII used this pattern so that it could &quot;erase&quot; a section of [[punched tape|paper tape]] (a popular storage medium until the 1980s) by punching all possible holes at a particular character position, thus effectively replacing any previous information. Since Code 0 (null,all bits off) was also ignored it was possible to leave gaps and then make corrections by blanking characters before or after the gap and then entering new characters in the gap.

Many of the ASCII control codes serve (or served) to mark data packets, or to control a data transmission protocol (e.g. ENQuiry [effectively, &quot;any stations out there?&quot;], ACKnowledge, Negative AcKnowledge, Start Of Header, Start of TeXt, End of TeXt, etc). ESCape and SUBstitute permit a communications protocol to, for instance, mark binary data so that if it contains codes with the same pattern as a protocol character, the recipient will process the code as data.

The designers of ASCII intended the separator characters (&quot;Record Separator&quot;, etc.) for use with magnetic tape systems.

Two of the device control characters, commonly interpreted as [[XON]] and [[XOFF]], generally function as [[flow control]] characters to throttle data flow to a slow device (such as a printer) from a fast device (such as a computer) - so data does not overrun and get lost.

Early users of ASCII adopted some of the control codes to represent &quot;meta information&quot; such as end-of-line, start/end of a data element, and so on. These assignments often conflict, so part of the effort in converting data from one format to another involves making the correct meta information transformations. For example, the character(s) representing end-of-line (&quot;[[newline]]&quot;) in text data files/streams vary from [[operating system]] to operating system. When moving files from one system to another, the conversion process must recognize these characters as end-of-line markers and handle them appropriately.

Today, ASCII users use the control characters less and less‚Äîwith the exception of &quot;carriage return&quot; and/or &quot;line feed&quot;.  Modern markup languages, modern communication protocols, the move from text-based to graphical devices, and the demise of teleprinters, punch-cards, and paper tapes have rendered most of the control characters obsolete.

# Printable Representation, the [[Unicode]] glyphs reserved for representing control characters when it is necessary to print or display them rather than have them perform their intended function.
# Control key Sequence, the traditional key sequences for inputting control characters.  The caret (^) represents the &quot;Control&quot; or &quot;Ctrl&quot; key that must be held down while pressing the second key in the sequence.  The caret-key representation is also used by some software to represent control characters.
# The Backspace character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot;, &quot;Bksp&quot;, or ‚Üê key on some systems.
# The Delete character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Del&quot; key.  It can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot;, &quot;Bksp&quot;, or ‚Üê key on some systems.
# The Escape character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Escape&quot; or &quot;Esc&quot; key on some systems.
# The Carriage Return character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Return&quot;, &quot;Ret&quot;, &quot;Enter&quot;, or ‚Üµ key on most systems.
# The ambiguity surrounding the Backspace key comes from systems that translated the DEL control character into a BS (backspace) before transmitting it.  Some software was unable to process the character and would display &quot;^H&quot; instead.  &quot;^H&quot; persists in messages today as a deliberate humorous device, e.g. [[there's a sucker born every minute|&quot;there's a sucker^H^H^H^H^H^Hpotential customer born every minute&quot;]].  A less common variant of this involves the use of &quot;^W&quot;, which in some [[text editor|text editors]] means &quot;delete previous word&quot;. The example sentence would therefore also work as &quot;there's a sucker^W potential customer born every minute&quot;.

==ASCII printable characters==
Code 32, the [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the large space-bar of a keyboard. Codes 33 to 126, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Seven-bit ASCII provided seven &quot;national&quot; characters and, if the combined hardware and software permit, can use overstrikes to simulate some additional international characters: in such a scenario a backspace can precede a [[grave accent]] (which the American and British standards, but only those standards, also call &quot;opening single quotation mark&quot;), a [[tilde]], or a breath mark (inverted [[vel]]).

==Structural features==
* The digits 0-9 are represented with their values in binary prefixed with 0011 (this means that [[Binary-coded decimal|bcd]]-ASCII is simply a matter of taking each bcd nibble separately and prefixing 0011 to it.
* Lowercase and uppercase letters only differ in bit pattern by a single bit simplifying case conversion to a range test (to avoid converting characters that are not letters) and a single [[bitwise operation]].

==Aliases for ASCII==
RFC 1345 (published in June 1992) and the [http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets IANA registry of character sets] (ongoing), both recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:

* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ASCII
* US-ASCII (preferred MIME name)
* us
* ISO646-US
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* iso-ir-6
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII

Of these, only the aliases &quot;US-ASCII&quot; and &quot;ASCII&quot; have achieved widespread use. One often finds them in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some [[MIME]] messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prolog of some [[XML]] documents.

==Variants of ASCII==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII in order to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;ASCII [[Extended ASCII|extensions]]&quot;, although some mis-apply that term to cover all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.

[[ISO 646]] (1972), the first attempt to remedy the pro-English-language bias, created compatibility problems, since it remained a 7-bit character-set. It made no additional codes available, so it reassigned some in language-specific variants. It thus became impossible to know what character a code represented without knowing which variant to work with, and text-processing systems could generally cope with only one variant anyway.

Eventually, improved technology brought out-of-band means to represent the information formerly encoded in the eighth bit of each byte, freeing this bit to add another 128 additional character-codes for new assignments. For example, [[IBM]] developed 8-bit [[code page]]s, such as [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[smiley]] faces, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 bytes. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware.

Eight-bit standards such as [[ISO 8859|ISO/IEC 8859]] and [[Mac OS Roman]] developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact and just adding additional values above the 7-bit range. This enabled the representation of a broader range of languages, but these standards continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations. Still, [[ISO-8859-1]] its variant [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1) and original 7-bit ASCII remain the most common character encodings in use today.

[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII basically uses 7-bit codes, Unicode and the UCS use relatively abstract &quot;code points&quot;: non-negative integer numbers that map, using different encoding forms and schemes, to sequences of one or more 8-bit bytes. To permit backward compatibility, Unicode and the UCS assign the first 128 code points to the same characters as ASCII. One can therefore think of ASCII as a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode and of the UCS. The popular [[UTF-8]] encoding-form prescribes the use of one to four 8-bit code values for each code point character, and equates exactly to ASCII for the code values below 128. Other encoding forms such as [[UTF-16]] resemble ASCII in how they represent the first 128 characters of Unicode, but tend to use 16 or 32 bits per character, so they require conversion for compatibility.

The [[blend (linguistics)|blend]] word ''ASCIIbetical'' has evolved to describe the [[collation]] of data in ASCII-code order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;Jargon File. [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ASCIIbetical-order.html ASCIIbetical]. Accessed [[December 17]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation ASCIIZ or ASCIZ refers to a [[Character string (computer science)|null-terminated ASCII string]].

[[Image:Africa satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|280px|A satellite composite image of Africa]] 

'''Africa''' is the world's second-largest and second most populous [[continent]], after [[Asia]].  At about 30,370,000 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (11,730,000 [[square mile|sq mi]]) including its adjacent islands, it covers 5.9% of the [[Earth]]'s total surface area, and 20.3% of the total land area. With over 840,000,000 people (as of 2005) in 61 territories, it accounts for more than 12% of the world's [[human population]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:LocationAfrica.png|thumb|250px|World map showing Africa (geographically)]]
The name '''Africa''' came into Western use through the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who used the name ''Africa terra'' ‚Äî &quot;land of the Afri&quot; (plural, or &quot;Afer&quot; singular) ‚Äî for the northern part of the continent, as the [[Africa (province)|province of Africa]] with its capital [[Carthage]], corresponding to modern-day [[Tunisia]].

The Afri were a tribe ‚Äî possibly [[Berber]] ‚Äî who dwelt in [[North Africa]] in the Carthage area.  The origin of ''Afer'' may be connected with [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] ''`afar'', [[dust]] (also found in most other [[Semitic languages]]); some other etymologies that have been postulated for the ancient name 'Africa' that are much more debatable include:

:*the [[Latin]] word ''aprica'', meaning &quot;sunny&quot;; 

:*the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''aphrike'', meaning &quot;without cold&quot; (see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). The historian [[Leo Africanus]] ([[1495]]-[[1554]]) attributed the origin to the Greek word ''phrike'' (œÜœÅŒØŒ∫Œ∑, meaning &quot;cold and horror&quot;), combined with the negating prefix a-, so meaning a land free of cold and horror. However, the change of sound from ''ph'' to ''f'' in Greek is datable to about the [[first century]], so this is unlikely to be the origin.

Ancient Africa extended into what is now known as Asia.  There was no line drawn between the two continents until the geographer [[Ptolemy]] ([[85]] - [[165]] AD), accepted [[Alexandria]] as [[Prime Meridian]] and made the [[Suez Canal|isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between [[Asia]] and Africa. As [[Europe]]ans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of ''Africa'' expanded with their knowledge.

==Geography==
''Main article: [[Geography of Africa]]''

[[Image:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|250px|Africa in the [[Blue marble]] picture, with [[Antarctica]] to the south, and the [[Sahara]] and [[Arabian peninsula]] at the top of the globe]]

Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the main mass of the Earth's surface. It includes within its remarkably regular outline an area, of c. 30,360,288 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (11,722,173 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]), including the islands.

Separated from [[Europe]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the [[Suez Canal|Isthmus of Suez]] (transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km (80 miles) wide. ([[Geopolitical]]ly, [[Egypt]]'s [[Sinai Peninsula]] east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.) From the most northerly point,  [[Cape Blanc]] (Ra‚Äôs al Abyad) in [[Tunisia]] (37&amp;deg;21&amp;prime; N), to the most southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in [[South Africa]] (34&amp;deg;51&amp;prime;15&amp;Prime; S), is a distance approximately of 8,000 km (5,000 miles); from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]], 17&amp;deg;33&amp;prime;22&amp;Prime; W, the westernmost point, to [[Ras Hafun]] in [[Somalia]], 51&amp;deg;27&amp;prime;52&amp;Prime; E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of 7,400 km (4,600 miles). The length of coast-line is 26,000 km (16,100 miles) and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is shown by the fact that Europe, which covers only [[1 E12 m¬≤|9,700,000 km&amp;sup2;]] (3,760,000 square miles), has a coast-line of 32,000 km (19,800 miles).

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. Africa is thus composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, the southern from north to south, the subordinate lines corresponding in the main to these two directions.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Africa]]''
[[Image:Afryka 1890.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Map of Africa 1890]]

Africa is home to the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on earth, with the [[human]] race [[mitochondrial Eve|originating]] from this continent. During the mid 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago. Fossil remains of several species of early ape-like humans thought to have [[evolve]]d into modern day man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[radiometrically dated]] to 3.9-3.0 million years [[Before_Christ|BC]]), ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'' (2.3-1.4 million BC) and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (c. 600,000-1.9 million BC) has been discovered.

The [[Ishango Bone]], dated to c. 25,000 years ago, shows [[tally stick|tallies]] in [[mathematical notation]]. Throughout humanity's [[prehistory]], Africa (like all other continents) had no [[nation state]]s, and was instead inhabited by groups of [[hunter-gatherers]] such as the [[Khoi]] and [[San]] (formerly known as [[bushmen]]).
 
Around 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Africa with the rise of literacy in [[Egypt]], which continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until 343 BC. Other prominent [[civilization]]s include [[Ethiopia]], the [[Nubia]]n kingdom, [[Carthage]], the kingdoms of the [[Sahelian kingdom|Sahel]] ([[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]], and [[Songhai empire|Songhai]]) and [[Great Zimbabwe]].

In 1482, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] established the first of many trading stations along the Guinea coast at [[Elmina]]. The chief commodities dealt in were slaves, gold, ivory and spices. The European discovery of America in 1492 was followed by a great development of the [[slave trade]], which, before the Portuguese era, had been an overland trade almost exclusively, and never confined to any one continent.

But at the same time that slavery was ending in Europe, in the early 19th century the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers staged a massive &quot;[[scramble for Africa]]&quot; and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: [[Liberia]], the Black American colony, and [[Ethiopia]]. This occupation continued until after the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.

Today, Africa is home to over 50 independent countries, all but 2 of which still have the [[border]]s drawn up during the era of European [[colonialism]].

==Politics==
[[Image:ColonialAfrica.png|frame|''Map showing European claimants to the African continent at the beginning of [[World War I]]'']]
===Precolonial Africa===
{{sect-stub}}
===Colonial Africa===
[[Colonialism]] had a destabilizing effect on what had been a number of ethnic groups that is still being felt in African politics. Prior to European influence, national borders were not much of a concern, with Africans generally following the practice of other areas of the world, such as the Arabian peninsula, where a group's territory was congruent with its military or trade influence. The European insistence of drawing borders around territories to isolate them from those of other colonial powers often had the effect of separating otherwise contiguous political groups, or forcing traditional enemies to live side by side with no buffer between them. For example, the [[Congo River]], although it appears to be a natural geographic boundary, had groups that otherwise shared a [[language]], [[culture]] or other similarity who resided on both sides. The division of the land between [[Belgium]] and [[France]] along the river isolated these groups from each other. Those who lived in Saharan or [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and traded across the continent for centuries often found themselves crossing &quot;borders&quot; that existed only on European maps.

In nations that had substantial European populations, for example [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]], systems of second-class citizenship were often set up in order to give Europeans [[political power]] far in excess of their numbers. However, the lines were not often drawn strictly across racial lines. In [[Liberia]], the citizens who were descendants of American slaves managed to have a political system for over 100 years that gave ex-slaves and natives to the area roughly equal [[legislative power]] despite the fact the ex-slaves were outnumbered ten to one in the general population. The inspiration for this system was the [[United States Senate]], which had balanced the power of free and slave states despite the much larger population of the former.

Europeans often changed the balance of power, created ethnic divides where they did not previously exist, and introduced a cultural dichotomy detrimental to the native inhabitants in the areas they controlled. For example, in what is now [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], two ethnic groups [[Hutus]] and [[Tutsis]] had merged into one culture by the time Belgian colonists had taken control of the region in the 19th century. No longer divided by ethnicity as intermingling, inter-marriage, and merging of cultural practices over the centuries had long since erased visible signs of a culture divide, the Belgians instituted a policy of racial categorization, upon taking control of the region, as racial based categorization and philosophies was a fixture of the European culture of that time. The term [[Hutu]] originally referred to the agricultural-based Bantu speaking tribes that moved into present day Rwandan and Burundi from the West, and the term [[Tutsi]] referred to North Eastern cattle-based tribes that migrated into the region later. The terms to the indigenous peoples eventually came to describe a person's economic class. Those individuals who owned roughly 10 or more cattle were considered Tutsi, and those with fewer were considered Hutu, regardless of ancestral history. This was not a strict line but a general rule of thumb, and one could move from Hutu to Tutsi and vice versa.

The Belgians introduced a racialised system. Those individuals who had characteristics the Europeans admired - fairer skin, ample height, narrow noses, etc. - were given power amongst the colonized peoples. The Belgians determined these features were more ideally [[Hamitic]], Hamitic in turn being more ideally European and belonged to those people closest to Tutsi in ancestry. They instituted a policy of issuing identity cards based on this philosophy. Those closest to this ideal were proclaimed Tutsi and those not were proclaimed Hutu.

===Post-colonial Africa===
Since independence, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African nations are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. Few nations in Africa have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments, instead cycling through a series of brutal [[Coup d'√©tat|coup]]s and [[military dictatorship]]s.

A number of Africa's post-colonial political leaders were poorly educated and ignorant on matters of governance; great instability, however, was mainly the result of marginalization of other ethnic groups and graft under these leaders. 

As well, many used the positions of power to ignite ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated, or even created, under colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed force|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and ruled most nations in Africa during the [[1970s|70s]] and early [[1980s|80s]].

During the period from the early [[1960s]] to the late 1980s Africa had over 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s.

[[Cold War]] conflicts between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] also played a role in the instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the [[United States]] and/or [[France]]. The 1970s saw an escalation as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the [[Soviet Union]] and the West and [[South Africa]] sought to contain Soviet influence.

Border and territorial disputes have also been common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts. 

Failed government policies and political corruption have also resulted in many widespread [[famine]]s, and significant portions of Africa remain with distribution systems unable to disseminate enough food or water for the population to survive. The spread of [[disease]] is also rampant, especially the spread of the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and the associated [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS), which has become a deadly [[epidemic]] on the continent.

Despite numerous hardships, there have been some signs the continent has hope for the future. [[Democracy|Democratic government]]s seem to be spreading, though are not yet the majority (National Geographic claims 13 African nations can be considered truly democratic). As well, many nations have at least nominally recognized basic [[human right]]s for all [[citizen]]s, though in practice these are not always recognized, and have created reasonably independent [[judiciary|judiciaries]].

There are clear signs of increased networking among African organisations and states. In the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, about half-a-dozen neighbouring African countries got involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). The death toll has been estimated by some to be 3.5 million since the conflict began in 1998. This might play a role similar to that of [[World War II]] for Europe, after which the people in the neighbouring countries decide to integrate their societies in such a way that war between them becomes as unthinkable as a war between, say, [[France]] and [[Germany]] would be today.

Political associations such as the [[African Union]] are also offering hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.

Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often times as a 'side-effect' of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], and [[C√¥te d'Ivoire]].

===Modern Africa===
Most western countries place limitations on aid to African nations, especially the United States. These limitations are often used to control the governments of these African nations; as a result, these nations are turning to non-traditional sources of financial aid. [[China]] has increasingly provided financial aid to Africa in order to secure contracts on [[Natural resource|natural resources]], such as [[petroleum|oil]], [[gold]], and [[diamonds]]. There usually is no political prescription. Countries the Chinese are investing in include:
Central African Republic (plantations), Nigeria ([[petroleum|oil]] &amp; [[gas]]), Sierra Leone ([[tourism]]), Gabon ([[petroleum|oil]]), Congo-Brazzaville ([[petroleum|oil]] &amp; wood-industry), Congo ([[copper]] &amp; [[cobalt]]), Angola ([[railroad]]-system), Libya ([[petroleum|oil]]), Sudan ([[petroleum|oil]]), Uganda ([[coffee]] &amp; [[fishing]]-industry), Kenya ([[Telecommunication|communications]]-network), Rwanda (public works), Burundi ([[Nickel]]), Zimbabwe (infrastructure), South Africa ([[coal]] &amp; [[gold]]).

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Africa]]''

Africa is the world's poorest inhabited continent: the [[United Nation]]s' [http://hdr.undp.org/ Human Development Report] [[2003]] (of 175 countries) found that positions 151 ([[Gambia]]) to 175 ([[Sierra Leone]]) were taken up entirely by African nations.

It has had (and in some ways is still having) a shaky and uncertain transition from [[colonialism]], with increases in [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[despotism]] being major contributing factors to its poor economic situation. While rapid growth in [[China]] and now [[India]], and moderate growth in [[Latin America]], has lifted millions beyond subsistence living, Africa has gone backwards in terms of foreign [[trade]], [[investment]], and [[per capita]] [[income]]. This [[poverty]] has widespread effects, including lower [[life expectancy]], [[violence]], and [[instability]] - factors intertwined with the continent's poverty. 

Major economic successes are [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]], which is developed to the extent that it has its own mature [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. This is partly due to its wealth of [[natural resource]]s, being the world's leading producer of both [[gold]] and [[diamond]]s, and partly due to its well-established legal system. South Africa also has access to financial capital, numerous markets and skilled labor. Other African countries are making comparable progress, such as [[Ghana]], and some, like Egypt, have a longer history of commercial and economic success.

[[Nigeria]] sits on one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world and has the highest population among nations in Africa, with one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. It is believed that with the country's rapidly expanding economy and increasing actions against corruption, Nigeria's status as Africa's economic powerhouse will soon be firmly established.

==Demographics==
Africans may be grouped according to whether they live north or south of the [[Sahara Desert]]; these groups are called [[North African]]s and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]ns, respectively. [[Afro-Asiatic]] speaking peoples predominate in North Africa, while Sub-Saharan Africa is dominated by a number of populations grouped according to their language --[[Niger-Congo]] predominantly in West Africa, [[Nilo-Saharan]] in the Eastern highlands and [[Khoisan]] in the south.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the Niger-Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and east Africa proper; but there are also several Nilotic groups in East Africa, and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ('[[San]]' or '[[Bushmen]]') and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon and southern Somalia. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also &quot;San&quot;, closely related to, but distinct from &quot;[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]&quot;) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. [[Pygmies]] are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.

The peoples of [[North Africa]] comprise two main groups; [[Berber]] and [[Arabic]]-speaking peoples in the west, and [[Demographics_of_Egypt#People|Egyptians]] in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century introduced the [[Arabic language]] and [[Islam]] to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns, and the European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] settled in North Africa as well. Berbers still make up the majority in [[Morocco]], while they are a significant minority within [[Algeria]]. They are also present in [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]. The [[Tuareg]] and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. [[Nubians]] are a [[Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking group (though many also speak Arabic), who developed an ancient civilization in Northeast Africa.

During the past century or so, small but economically important colonies of [[Demographics_of_Lebanon#The_Lebanese_Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.

Some [[Ethiopia]]n and Eritrean groups (like the [[Amhara]] and [[Tigray]]ans, collectively known as &quot;[[Habesha]]&quot;) have [[Semitic]] (Sabaean) ancestry. The Somalis as a people originated in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], but most Somali clans can trace some Arab ancestry as well. [[Sudan]] and [[Mauritania]] are divided between a mostly Arabized north and a native African south (although the &quot;Arabs&quot; of Sudan clearly have a predominantly native African ancestry themselves). Some areas of East Africa, particularly the island of [[Zanzibar]] and the Kenyan island of Lamu, received Arab Muslim and [[Southwest Asia]]n settlers and merchants throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and in antiquity.

Beginning in the [[16th century]], Europeans such as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] began to establish [[trading post]]s and [[Fortification|forts]] along the coasts of western and southern Africa. Eventually, a large number of Dutch, augmented by French [[Huguenots]] and [[German people|Germans]] settled in what is today [[South Africa]]. Their descendants, the [[Afrikaners]] and the [[Coloureds]], are the largest European-descended groups in Africa today. In the [[19th century]], a second phase of colonization brought a large number of French and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] settlers to Africa. The Portuguese settled mainly in Angola, but also in Mozambique. The French settled in large numbers in [[Algeria]] where they became known collectively as ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', and on a smaller scale in other areas of North and West Africa as well as in Madagascar. The British settled chiefly in South Africa as well as the colony of [[Rhodesia]], and in the highlands of what is now [[Kenya]]. Germans settled in what is now [[Tanzania]] and [[Namibia]], and there is still a population of German-speaking white Namibians. Smaller numbers of European soldiers, businessmen, and officials also established themselves in administrative centers such as [[Nairobi]] and [[Dakar]]. Decolonization during the 1960s often resulted in the mass emigration of European-descended settlers out of Africa &amp;mdash; especially from Algeria, Angola, Kenya and Rhodesia (now [[Zimbabwe]]). However, in South Africa and Namibia, the white minority remained politically dominant after independence from Europe, and a significant population of white Africans remained in these two countries even after [[liberal democracy|democracy]] was finally instituted at the end of the [[Cold War]]. South Africa has also become the preferred destination of white Anglo-Zimbabweans, and of migrants from all over southern Africa.

European colonization also brought sizeable groups of [[Asians]], particularly people from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Indian diaspora|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and east African countries. A fairly large Indian community in [[Uganda]] was expelled by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the [[Indian Ocean]] are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy]] people of [[Madagascar]] are a [[Malay people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents).

==Languages==
[[Image:African language families.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing the distribution of African language families and some major African languages. [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] extends from the [[Sahel]] to [[Southwest Asia]]. [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] is divided to show the size of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu sub-family]].]]

''Main article: [[African languages]]''

By most estimates Africa contains well over a thousand [[language]]s. There are four major [[language family|language families]] native to Africa.

* The [[Afro-Asiatic languages|''Afro-Asiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout North Africa, [[East Africa]], the Sahel, and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are mainly spoken in [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger-Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages. A substantial number of them are the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages spoken in much of sub-Saharan Africa. 
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about 50 and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120 000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa. 

With a few notable exceptions in [[East Africa]], nearly all African countries have adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent and spread through [[colonialism]] or [[human migration]]. For example, in numerous countries [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and [[Malagasy]] are other examples of originally non-African languages that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres.

==Culture==
Africa has a number of overlapping cultures. The most conventional distinction is that between sub-Saharan Africa and the northern countries from [[Egypt]] to [[Morocco]], who largely associate themselves with [[Arab]]ic culture. In this comparison, the nations to the south of the [[Sahara]] are considered to consist of many cultural areas, in particular that of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] linguistic group.

Divisions may also be made between [[Francophone Africa]] and the rest of Africa, in particular the former British colonies of [[southern Africa|southern]] and [[East Africa]]. Another cultural fault-line is that between those Africans living traditional lifestyles and those who are essentially modern. The traditionalists are sometimes subdivided into [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] and [[agriculture|agriculturalists]].

[[African art]] reflects the diversity of African cultures. The oldest existing art from Africa are 6000-year old carvings found in [[Niger]], while the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the world's tallest architectural accomplishment for four thousand years until the creation of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The Ethiopian complex of [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], of which the [[Church of St. George]] is representative, is regarded as another marvel of engineering.

The [[music of Africa]] is one of its most dynamic art forms. Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular west Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[rap music|rap]], and [[rock and roll]]. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. A recent development of the 21st century is the emergence of [[African hip hop]], in particular a form from [[Senegal]] is blended with traditional [[mbalax]]. Recently in South Africa, a form of music related to [[house music]] known under the name [[Kwaito]] has developed, although the country has been home to its own form of [[South African jazz]] for some time, while [[Afrikaans]] music is completely distinct and comprised mostly of traditional [[Boere musiek]], and forms of [[Folk music|Folk]] and [[Rock and roll|Rock]].

* [[Afrology]]

==Religion==
Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widespread. Approximately 40% of all Africans are Christians and another 40% Muslims. Roughly 20% of Africans primarily follow indigenous [[African religions]]. A small number of Africans also have beliefs [[African Jew|from the Judaic tradition]], such as the [[Beta Israel]] and [[Lemba]] tribes.

The indigenous African religions tend to revolve around [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]]. A common thread in traditional belief systems was the division of the [[spiritual world]] into &quot;helpful&quot; and &quot;harmful&quot;. Helpful [[Spiritual being|spirits]] are usually deemed to include ancestor spirits that help their descendants, and powerful spirits that protected entire communities from natural disaster or attacks from enemies; whereas harmful spirits include the [[soul]]s of murdered victims who were buried without the proper [[Funeral|funeral rites]], and spirits used by hostile spirit [[Medium (spirituality)|mediums]] to cause illness among their enemies. While the effect of these early forms of worship continues to have a profound influence, belief systems have evolved as they interact with other religions.

The formation of the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Egypt]] in the [[third millennium BCE]] marked the first known complex religious system on the continent. Around the [[ninth century BCE]], [[Carthage]] (in present-day [[Tunisia]]) was founded by the Phoenicians, and went on to become a major cosmopolitan center where [[deity|deities]] from neighboring Egypt, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan city-states]] were worshipped.

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] officially dates from the [[fourth century]], and is thus one of the first established [[Christianity|Christian]] churches anywhere. At first Christian Orthodoxy made gains in modern-day Sudan and other neighbouring regions; however following the spread of Islam, growth was slow and restricted to the highlands.

Islam entered Africa as Muslims conquered North Africa between 640 and 710, beginning with Egypt. They established Mogadishu, Melinde, Mombasa, Kilwa, and Sofala, following the sea trade down the coast of [[East Africa]], and diffusing through the Sahara desert into the interior of Africa -- following in particular the paths of Muslim traders. Muslims were also among the Asian peoples who later settled in British-ruled Africa.

Many Africans were converted to [[Western Christianity|West European forms of Christianity]] during the colonial period. In the last decades of the twentieth century, various sects of [[charismatic movement|Charismatic Christianity]] rapidly grew. A number of Roman Catholic African bishops were even mentioned as possible [[Pope|papal]] candidates in 2005. African Christians appear to be more socially conservative than their co-religionists in much of the industrialized world, which has quite recently led to tensions within [[Religious denomination|denominations]] such as the [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] and [[Methodism|Methodist Churches]].

[[Image:Animexample.gif]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''This animation moves at 10 frames per second.''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Animexample2.gif]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''This animation moves at 2 frames per second. At this rate, the individual frames should be discernible.''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Animhorse.gif|200px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''12 frames per second is the typical rate for an [[animated cartoon]].''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

'''Animation''' is the illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of images of static elements. In film and video production, this refers to techniques by which each frame of a [[film]] or [[Film|movie]] is produced individually. These frames may be generated by computers, or by photographing a drawn or painted image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed, there is an illusion of continuous movement due to the phenomenon known as [[persistence of vision]]. Generating such a film tends to be very labour intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process.

[[Graphics file format]]s like [[GIF]], [[MNG]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]](SWF) allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the Internet.

[[Image:Animexample3.png|frame|none|''The animations shown before consist of these 6 frames.'']]
__TOC__

== Animation techniques ==
[[Traditional animation]] began with each frame being painted and then filmed. [[Traditional animation|Cel animation]], developed by [[Bray Productions|Bray]] and Hurd in the 1910s, sped up the process by using transparent overlays so that characters could be moved without the need to repaint the background for every frame. More recently, styles of animation based on painting and drawing have evolved, such as the minimalist [[Simpsons]] cartoons, or the roughly sketched [[The Snowman]].

[[Computer animation]] has advanced rapidly, and is now approaching the point where movies can be created with characters so lifelike as to be hard to distinguish from real actors. This involved a move from 2D to 3D, the difference being that in 2D animation the effect of perspective is created artistically, but in 3D objects are modeled in an internal 3D representation within the computer, and are then 'lit' and 'shot' from chosen angles, just as in real life, before being 'rendered' to a 2D bitmapped frame. Predictions that famous dead actors might even be 'brought back to life' to play in new movies before long have led to speculation about the moral and copyright issues involved. The use of computer animation as a way of achieving the otherwise impossible in conventionally shot movies has led to the term &quot;[[computer generated imagery]]&quot; being used, though the term has become hard to distinguish from computer animation as it is now used in referring to 3D movies that are entirely animated.

Computer animation involves modelling, motion generation, followed by the addition of surfaces and then [[rendering]]. Surfaces are programmed to stretch and bend automatically in response to movements of a '[[wire frame model]]', and the final rendering converts such movements to a [[Raster graphics|bitmap image]]. It is the recent developments in rendering complex surfaces like fur and clothing textures that have enabled stunningly life-like character models, including surfaces that even ripple, fold and blow in the wind, with every fibre or hair individually calculated for rendering.  However, that actually has little to do with the animation itself.  Animation is the process of bringing a lifeless puppet to life through the use of motion.  Many people confuse fancy effects and high-res textures with animation, but in fact life-like motion can be created using the simplest of models.  Pixar's work is a testament to this.  The goal of an animator is not simply to &quot;copy&quot; the real world, but to enhance and to take the essence of the motion that is there, and this is how animation can be elevated to the level of art.

There is a large misconception in the public mind that computers create animation today.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  A computer is nothing more (though also nothing less) than a very expensive fancy pencil, and has to be treated as such for any quality work to be acheived.  The choices a computer makes when interpolating motion are almost always the wrong ones, because the computer does not know what you are trying to create.  Even if a complex physics system were created complete enough to exactly mimic the real world, the end result would not be the desirable one, because a large part of animation concerns the choices an animator makes.  When a computer tries to make the choices for you, disaster is the general result.

==History==
{{see|Animated cartoon|History of animation}}

The major use of animation has always been for entertainment. However, there is growing use of [[instructional animation]] and [[educational animation]] to support explanation and learning.

The &quot;classic&quot; form of animation, the &quot;[[animated cartoon]]&quot;, as developed in the early 1900s and refined by [[Ub Iwerks]], [[Walt Disney]] and others, requires up to 24 distinct drawings for one second of animation. This technique is described in detail in the article [[Traditional animation]].

Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and movies comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the [[1950s]], with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.  [[Bill Plympton]] is one of the most well known independent animators today.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using &quot;short cuts&quot; in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized (some say exploited) by [[Hanna-Barbera]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].

==Animation studios==
Animation Studios, like [[Movie studio|Movie Studios]] may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[Anime]] they have things in common with [[Studio|artists studios]] where a Master or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision.

[[Image: Statue of Apollo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Statue of Apollo at the [[British Museum]].]]

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], '''Apollo''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: &amp;#913;&amp;#960;&amp;#972;&amp;#955;&amp;#955;&amp;#969;&amp;#957;, '''''Ap√≥ll&amp;#333;n'''''; or &amp;Alpha;&amp;pi;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;, ''Apell&amp;#333;n'') was a god of light, healing and poetry. Apollo was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. As the prophetic deity of the [[Delphic Sibyl|Delphic Oracle]], Apollo was one of the most important and many-sided of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]]. In [[Etruscan mythology]], he was known as [[Aplu]].

In later times, Apollo became partly confused or equated with [[Helios]], [[solar deity|god of the sun]], and his sister similarly equated with [[Selene]], [[lunar deity|god of the moon]], particularly in religious contexts. However, Apollo and Helios remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts.

==Domains and symbols==
[[Image:Apollo II (Greek Mythology).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Apollo, the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Leto]].]]

Apollo was considered to have dominion over disease, beauty, light, healing, [[colony|colonists]], [[medicine]], [[archery]], [[poetry]], [[prophecy]], [[dance]], [[reason]], [[intellectualism]], and [[shaman]]s, and was the patron defender of herds and flocks.

Apollo's most common attributes were the lyre and the bow. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]) and [[plectrum]]. Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[laurel tree|laurel]] bay plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games. The palm-tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins and roe, swans and grasshoppers (symbolizing music and song), hawks, ravens, crows and snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice, and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle-lion hybrids of Eastern origin.

As god of colonization, Apollo gave guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, [[750 BC|750&amp;ndash;550 BC]].  According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists find the city of Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of ''Wilusa'', which is now regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Illios]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo‚Äôs title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

Apollo popularly (e.g., in [[literary criticism]]) represents harmony, order, and reasons&amp;mdash;characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who popularly represents emotion and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives ''[[Apollonian]]'' and ''[[Dionysian]]''. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphi Oracle to Dionysus.

==Worship==
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in [[Delphi]], and other notable ones in [[Clarus]] and [[Branchidae]]. Apollo is known as the leader of the [[Muse]]s ('''''musagetes''''') and director of their choir. Hymns sung to Apollo were called [[Paean]]s.

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. There is a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. In [[430]], a temple was dedicated to Apollo on the occasion of a pestilence. During the [[Second Punic War]] in [[212]], the Ludi Apollinares were instituted in his honor. In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, His worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome. After the [[battle of Actium]], Augustus enlarged his old temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour. He also erected a new temple on the Palatine hill and transferred the secular games, for which Horace composed his ''Carmen Saeculare'', to Apollo and [[Diana]].

The chief festivals held in honour of Apollo were the [[Carneia]], [[Daphnephoria]], [[Delia]], [[Hyacinthia]], [[Pyanepsia]], [[Pythia]] and [[Thargelia]]. The [[Ludi Apollinares]] were solemn games held to honor him.

The worship of Apollo has returned with the rise of [[revivalism|revivalist]] [[Hellenic polytheism]], and the contemporary Pagan movement. One example of this revival is the group [http://winterscapes.com/kyklosapollon Kyklos Apollon]. Also, together with Athena, Apollo (under the name Phevos) was controversially designated as a mascot of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

==Etymology==
The name ''Apollo'' might have been derived from a Pre-Hellenic compound ''Apo-ollon'',{{fact}} likely related to an archaic verb ''Apo-ell-'' and literally meaning &quot;he who elbows off&quot;, that is &quot;the Dispelling One.&quot; Indeed, he seems to have personified dispelling power, which would relate to his association with the darkness-dispelling power of the morning sun and  the conceived power of reason and prophecy to dispel doubt and ignorance. 
In addition:

* The apparent expelling character of city walls and doorways as bulwarks against trespassers
* The people-dispelling nature of disembarkations and [[expatriation]]s to colonies
* The disease-dispelling character of healing
* The predator-dispelling character of a shepherd tending his flocks
* The pest-dispelling nature of a farmer growing crops
* The power of music and the arts to dispel discord and [[barbary]]
* The highly important power of fit and skilled young men to dispel intruders and invading armies
* The ability of foresight into the future

An explanation given by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' is that Apollon signified a [[unity]], since ''pollon'' meant &quot;many,&quot; and the [[prefix]] ''a-'' was a negative. Thus, Apollon could be read as meaning &quot;deprived of multitude.&quot; Apollo was consequently associated with the [[monad]].

[[Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric &amp;alpha;&amp;pi;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;alpha;, which means assembly, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation &amp;sigma;&amp;eta;&amp;kappa;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (&quot;fold&quot;), in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.

== Apollo in art ==
In art, Apollo is usually depicted as a handsome beardless young man and often with a lyre or bow in hand. In the late 2nd century floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman Thysdrus, (''illustration, right''), he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent halo, though now even a god's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire. Anther haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse [http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html].The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980).  Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ will be beardless and haloed.

== Appellations ==
[[Epithet]]s applied to Apollo include:
*'''Phoebus''' (&quot;shining one&quot;), for Apollo in the context of the god of light
*'''Smintheus''' (&quot;mouse-catcher&quot;) and '''Parnopius''' (&quot;grasshopper&quot;), as god of the plague and defender against rats and locusts.
*'''Delphinios''' (&quot;delphinian&quot;), meaning &quot;of the womb&quot;, associating Apollo with ''Delphoi'' ([[Delphi]]). An [[aitiology]] in the [[Homeric hymns]] connects the epitheton to [[dolphin]]s.
*'''Archegetes''', (&quot;director of the foundation&quot;) for colonies.
*'''Musagetes''' (&quot;leader of the [[muses]]&quot;).

== Birth ==

When [[Hera]] discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Hera's husband, Zeus, was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on &quot;terra-firma&quot;, or the mainland, or any island at sea.  In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of [[Delos]], which was neither mainland nor a real island, and gave birth there.  The island was surrounded by swans.  Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.  Alternatively, Hera kidnapped [[Ilithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor.  The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards long, of amber.  Either way, Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo.  Another version states that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the 7th day (&amp;eta;&amp;#788;&amp;beta;&amp;delta;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;eta;&amp;sigmaf;) of the month Thargelion according to Delian tradition or of the month Bysios according to Delphian tradition. The 7th and 20th, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.

== Youth ==
In his youth, Apollo killed the vicious dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived in [[Delphi]] beside the [[Castalian Spring]], according to some because Python had attempted to rape Leto while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis.This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the [[Oracle]] at Delphi to give her prophesies.  Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

== Apollo and Admetus ==
When Zeus struck down Apollo's son, [[Asclepius]], with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead (and thus stealing [[Hades]]'s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclops]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] forever, but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labour as punishment, thanks to the intercession of his mother, [[Leto]]. During this time he served as shepherd for [[Admetus|King Admetus]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]]. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.

Apollo helped Admetus win [[Alcestis]], the daughtor of [[Pelias|King Pelias]] and later convinced the [[Moirae|Fates]] to let Admetus live past his time if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his elderly parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but [[Heracles]] managed to &quot;persuade&quot; [[Thanatos]], the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.

== Apollo during the [[Trojan War]] ==

Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the [[Trojan War]] in rage because the Greeks had kidnapped Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest. He demanded her return, and the Greeks eventually complied.

When [[Diomedes]] injured [[Aeneas]] during the [[Trojan War]], Apollo rescued him.  First, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well.  Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], who took him to [[Pergamos (troy)|Pergamos]], a sacred spot in [[Troy]]. [[Artemis]] healed Aeneas there.

Apollo had aided Paris in the killing of [[Achilles]], if Paris did not accomplish the task himself.

== Niobe ==

A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.  Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life, and Artemis her daughters.  Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared ([[Chloris]], usually).  Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.  A devastated Niobe fled to [[Mt. Siplyon]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept.  Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]].  Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

== Apollo's romantic life and children ==

===Female lovers===
Apollo chased the nymph [[Daphne]], daughter of [[Peneus]], who had scorned him. His infatuation was caused by an arrow from [[Eros (god)|Eros]], who was jealous because Apollo had made fun of his archery skills.  Eros also claimed to be irritated by Apollo's singing. Simultaneously, however, Eros had shot a hate arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prayed to Mother earth (alternatively, her father- a river god) to help her and he changed her into a Laurel tree, which became sacred to Apollo.

Apollo had an affair with a mortal princess named [[Leucothea]], daughter of [[Orchamus]] and sister of [[Clytia]]. Leucothea loved Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea's mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well.  [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved.  She fled from him and dived into the spring at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire poets.

By [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], Apollo had a son named [[Aristaeus]], who became the patron god of cattle, [[fruit trees]], hunting, husbandry and [[bee-keeping]]. He was also a [[culture-hero]] and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting, as well as how to cultivate olives.

With [[Hecuba]], wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], Apollo had a son named [[Troilius]].  An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilius reached the age of twenty alive.  He and his sister, [[Polyxena]] were ambushed and killed by [[Achilles]].

Apollo also fell in love with [[Cassandra]], daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilius' half-sister.  He promised Cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards.  Enraged, Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future, with a curse that no one would ever believe her.

[[Coronis]], daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]], was another of Apollo's liaisons.  Pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]].  A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for speading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise. Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo then killed him for what he did.

===Male lovers===	
[[Image:Hyacinthus.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Apollo and Hyacinthus'''&lt;br&gt;Jacopo Caraglio; 16th c. Italian engraving]]

Apollo, the eternal beardless [[kouros]] himself, had the most male lovers of all the [[Greek gods]]. That was to be expected from a god who was god of the [[palaestra]], the athletic gathering place for youth who all competed [[Nudity in sport|in the nude]], a god said to represent the ideal educator and therefore the ideal [[erastes]], or lover of a boy (Sergent, p.102). All his lovers were younger than him, in the style of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek pederastic relationships]] of the time. Many of Apollo's young beloveds died &quot;accidentally&quot;, a reflection on the function of these myths as part of [[rite of passage|rites of passage]], in which the youth died in order to be reborn as an adult.	 

[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] was one of his male lovers. Hyacinthus was a [[Sparta|Spartan]] prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair were practicing throwing the [[discus]] when Hyacinthus was struck in the head by a discus blown off course by [[Zephyrus]], who was jealous of Apollo and loved Hyacinthus as well. When Hyacinthus died, Apollo is said in some accounts to have been so filled with grief that he cursed his own immortality, wishing to join his lover in mortal death. Out of the blood of his slain lover Apollo created the [[hyacinth (flower)|hyacinth flower]] as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with ''Œ¨ŒØ'' ''Œ¨ŒØ'', meaning alas. The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.

One of his other liaisons was with [[Acantha]], the spirit of the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] tree. Upon his death, he was transformed into a sun-loving herb by Apollo, and his bereaved sister, Acanthis, was turned into a thistle finch by the other gods.

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave the boy a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo turned the sad boy into a [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] tree, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

== Apollo and the Birth of [[Hermes]] ==

Hermes was born on [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia. The story is told in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Hermes]]. His mother, [[Maia]], had been secretly impregnated by [[Zeus]], in a secret affair. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep. Hermes ran to [[Thessaly]], where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first [[lyre]]. Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo became a master of the lyre and Hermes invented a kind of pipes-instrument called a [[syrinx]].

Later, Apollo exchanged a [[caduceus]] for a [[syrinx]] from Hermes.

== Other stories ==

=== Musical contests ===

==== [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] ====

Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the [[lyre]], to a trial of skill.  [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire.  Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present.  Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre.  Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment.  He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

==== [[Marsyas]] ====
[[Image:The Flaying of Marsyas.jpg|thumb|230px|''The Flaying of Marsyas'' by [[Titian]], c.1570-76.]]
Marsyas was a [[satyr]] who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Marsyas lost and was [[flaying|flayed]] alive in a cave near [[Calaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. His blood turned into the river Marsyas.

Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the flute), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive. [taken from ''MAN MYTH &amp; MAGIC'' by Richard Cavendish]

=== Miscellaneous ===

When Zeus killed [[Asclepius]] for raising the dead and violating the natural order of things, Apollo killed the [[Cyclopes]] in response.  They had fashioned Zeus' thunderbolts, which he used to kill Apollo's son, Asclepius. As punishment, he was condemned by Zeus to year's servitude to King Admetus.

Apollo gave the order, through the Oracle at Delphi, for [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] to kill his mother, [[Clytemnestra]], and her lover, [[Aegisthus]].  Orestes was punished fiercely by the [[Erinyes]] for this crime.

In the [[Odyssey]], [[Odysseus]] and his surviving crew landed on an island sacred to Helios the sun god, where he kept sacred cattle. Though Odysseus warned his men not to (as [[Tiresias]] and [[kirke]] had told him), they killed and ate some of the cattle and Helios had [[Zeus]] destroy the ship and all the men save [[Odysseus]].

Apollo also had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

Apollo killed the [[Aloadae]] when they attempted to storm [[Mt. Olympus]].

It was also said that Apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperboreans]] during the winter months, a swan that he also lent to his beloved Hyacinthus to ride.

Apollo turned [[Cephissus]] into a [[sea monster]].

==Apollo in popular culture==
In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;[[Who Mourns for Adonis?]]&quot; a man claiming to be Apollo is seen on a [[Greek]]-themed planet that [[Captain Kirk]], [[Pavel Chekov]], [[Mr. Spock]], and [[Dr. McCoy]] arrive on.

In the ''[[Battlestar_Galactica|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series, one of the main characters is given the call-sign of Apollo.

The song &quot;[[Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres]]&quot; by [[Rush (band)|Rush]] is about the struggle between the champions of the two Hemispheres, Apollo, the God of Reason, and [[Dionysus]], the God of Love. The song appears of the [[1978]] album ''[[Hemispheres (1978 album)|Hemispheres]]''.

In the sixties, [[NASA]] named its [[Apollo program|Apollo Lunar program]] because Apollo was considered the god of all wisdom. Many people mistakenly believe that the rockets that carried astronauts to the Moon were called Apollo rockets; they were [[Saturn V]] rockets.

'''Andre Kirk Agassi''', (born [[April 29]] [[1970]], in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]) is a [[professional]] [[male]] former '''[[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]]''' [[tennis]] player from the [[United States]]. He has won eight [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, and is one of only five players to have won all four Grand Slam events. He is considered among the all-time great tennis players. 

Agassi was married to the actress [[Brooke Shields]] from 1997 to 1999. Since 2001, he has been married to the former World No. 1 woman tennis player [[Steffi Graf]] and had two children.

==Early life==
Agassi's father, (an Armenian from Iran) Emmanuel &quot;Mike&quot; Agassian (who represented [[Iran]] in [[boxing]] at the 1948 and 1952 [[Olympic Games]] before emigrating to the [[United States]]), was intent on having a child win all four tennis Grand Slams. He called Agassi's two older siblings &quot;guinea pigs&quot; in the development of his coaching techniques. He honed Andre's eye-coordination when he was an infant by hanging tennis balls above his crib. He gave Agassi paddles and balloons when he was still in a high chair. When Agassi started playing tennis, his ball collection filled 60 garbage cans with 300 balls per can, and Agassi would hit 3,000-5,000 balls every day. When Andre was five years old, he was already practicing with pros such as [[Jimmy Connors]] and [[Roscoe Tanner]].

Mike Agassi learned tennis by watching tapes of champions. Mike Agassi took a very systematic approach to the physics and psychology of tennis, and still remains active in the sport. (More information can be found in Mike Agassi's book, ''The Agassi Story''.)

At age of 14, Andre was shipped off to teaching guru [[Nick Bollettieri]]'s Tennis Academy in [[Florida]]. He turned professional when he was 16.

==Tennis career==
===1986-1997===
Agassi turned professional in 1986, and won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at [[Itaparica]]. He won six further tournaments in 1988, and by December that year he had surpassed US$2 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments ‚Äì the quickest player in history to do so.

As a young up-and-coming player, Agassi embraced a rebel image. He grew his hair to rock-star length, sported an ear-ring, and wore colorful shirts that pushed tennis' still-strict sartorial boundaries. He boasted of a cheeseburger-heavy diet and endorsed the Canon Rebel camera. &quot;Image is everything&quot; was the ad's tag line, and it became Andre's as well.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. But he began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the [[French Open]], where he lost in four sets to the seasoned veteran player [[Andr√©s G√≥mez]]. Later that year he lost in the final of the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] to another up-and-coming teenaged star, [[Pete Sampras]]. The rivalry between these two American players was to become the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest the of the decade. In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final where he faced his former Bollettieri Academy-mate [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a dramatic rain-interrupted five-set final. 

Agassi chose not to play at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] from 1988-90, and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly-white&quot; dress code which players at the event are required to conform to. Many observers at the time speculated that Agassi's real motivation was that his strong baseline game would not be well suited to Wimbledon's [[grass court]] surface. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about what he would wear ‚Äì he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He reached the quarter-finals on that occasion. 

To the surprise of many, Agassi's Grand Slam breakthrough came at Wimbledon in 1992, when he beat [[Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá]] in a tight five-set final. 

Following wrist surgery in 1993, Agassi came back strongly in 1994 and captured the US Open, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final. He then captured his first [[Australian Open]] title in 1995, beating Sampras in a four-set final. He won a career-high seven titles that year and he reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time that April. He held it for 30 weeks on that occasion through to November. He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer [[hardcourt]] circuit, which ended when he lost in the US Open final to Sampras. 

In 1995, Agassi won seven singles titles, the biggest being the [[Australian Open]], the [[Cincinnati Masters]], the [[Miami Masters]], and the [[Canada Masters]]. In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year (72/10) (includes Davis Cup). This is slightly short of  Sampras's best season, 1994, in which he (Sampras) won 77 matches and lost 12. 
In 1996, Agassi won the men's singles Gold Medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of [[Spain]] in straight sets in the final. He also repeated at the [[Cincinnati Masters]] and the [[Miami Masters]].

1997 was a poor year for Agassi. He won no top-level titles and his ranking sank to World No. 141 in November. His form was perhaps affected by the intense publicity surrounding his high-profile and turbulent relationship and marriage to actress Brooke Shields.

===1998-2004===
In 1998, Agassi rededicated himself to tennis. He shaved his balding head, began a rigorous conditioning program, and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments (a circuit for professional players ranked outside the world's top 50). Perhaps most remarkably, the one-time rebel emerged as a gracious and thoughtful athlete, looked up to by younger players. After winning matches, he took to bowing and blowing a two-handed kisses to spectators on each side of the court, a gesture seen as a rather humble acknowledgment of their support for him and for tennis.

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from No. 122 on the rankings at the start of the year, to No. 6 at the end of it, making it the highest jump into the Top 10 made by any player in tennis. He won five titles in ten finals, and finished runner-up at the [[Miami Masters]]. 

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he beat [[Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set French Open final to become only the fifth male player to have won all four Grand Slam singles titles (a feat last achieved in the 1960s by [[Roy Emerson]]). He followed this up by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras. He then won the US Open, beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets in the final, and finished the year ranked the World No. 1.

Agassi began 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final. He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969. 2000 also saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to [[Patrick Rafter]] in a very high quality battle considered by many to be one of the best matches ever played at Wimbledon [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm]. At the inaugural [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in [[Lisbon]], Agassi made it all the way to the final after defeating [[Marat Safin]] 6-3, 6-3 in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest World No. 1 in the history of tennis.  Agassi eventually lost to [[Gustavo Kuerten]] 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. This loss allowed Kuerten to be crowned year end World No. 1. 2000 is considered by many of his fans to be a disappointing season for Agassi, as he managed to win only one tournament (2000 Australian Open).

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over [[Arnaud Clement]]. At Wimbledon, he battled Rafter again in the semi-finals and lost 8-6 in the fifth set. At the US Open he lost in the quarter-finals to Sampras in what is considered to be one of tournament's all-time greatest matches. Sampras won 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-6 in a match with no breaks of serve. 

Agassi and Sampras' last duel came in the final of the US Open in 2002. The battle between the two veterans saw Sampras emerge victorious in four sets, and left Sampras with a 20-14 edge in their 34 career meetings. (The match in fact proved to be the last of Sampras' career. He did not play in an event on the professional tour again, and officially announced his retirement in 2003.) Agassi's US Open finish, along with his victories at the Miami Masters, [[Rome Masters]], and [[Madrid Masters]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Sch√ºttler]] in straight sets in the final. In May that year, he recaptured the World No.1 ranking to become the oldest No. 1 ranked male tennis player in history at 33 years and 13 days. He held the No. 1 ranking on that occasion for 13 weeks. At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, he lost in the final to [[Roger Federer]] and finished the year ranked World No. 4.

In 2004, the 34-year-old Agassi won the [[Cincinnati Masters]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles. He became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati's storied history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]] who won the title in 1970 at age 35.  

Agassi has also won one doubles title (at the [[Cincinnati Masters]] in 1993, partnering [[Petr Korda]]). He is one of only five male players to have won all the Grand Slams ‚Äì along with legends [[Don Budge]], [[Roy Emerson]], [[Rod Laver]] and [[Fred Perry]]. He is in fact the first male tennis player to win the four Grand Slams on four different surfaces. The previous players won the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open on grass courts and the French Open on [[clay court]]s; whereas Agassi won the Australian Open on [[Rebound Ace]], the French Open on clay, Wimbledon on grass, and the US Open on hardcourts. After winning [[French Open]] in 1999, Agassi became the first male tennis player to win the [[Career Golden Slam]]. Agassi also helped the United States win the [[Davis Cup]] in 1990 and 1992. He was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi has earned more than US$30 million in prize-money throughout his career, second only to Sampras. In addition to this, he also earns over US$25 million a year through endorsements, the most by any tennis player and fourth in all sports (first place is [[Tiger Woods]] at US$70 million a year).

===2005===
Agassi started off 2005 with strong runs, most of which were cut short by [[Roger Federer]]. He lost to Federer in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the semifinals at Dubai. He reached the quarterfinals at Indian Wells after a dominant victory over Guillermo Coria, but withdrew from his match with Lleyton Hewitt with a swollen big toe. Agassi lost in the semifinals at Miami to Federer in a tight match. Although the claycourt season is the toughest on the body, Agassi played in Rome and reached the semifinals which he lost to Coria in a tough battle. At the 2005 French Open, Agassi lost to [[Jarkko Nieminem]], in their first-round match after enduring back pain related to a pinched [[sciatic nerve]]. He lost in five sets with 6-0 in the fifth. After much media speculation about retirement, the 35-year-old Agassi won in Los Angeles and made the final at Montreal before falling to world No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]] in three long sets that he might have won if a few points had gone differently. His coach Darren Cahill and close friend and personal trainer [[Gil Reyes]] worked with Agassi throughout the summer to prepare for the [[2005 US Open]]. Agassi made a spectacular run at the Open, beating Razvan Sabau 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, [[Ivo Karlovic]] in the second round 7-6(7-4), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-4); [[Tom√°≈° Berdych]] 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(7-2); and [[Xavier Malisse]] 6-3, 6-4, 6-7(5-7), 4-6, 6-2. His quarterfinal match against fellow American [[James Blake]] has been called one of the best matches in US Open history. After dropping the first two sets, 3-6, 3-6, Agassi took the next two, 6-3, 6-3. In the fifth set, Blake served for the match at 5-4, but Agassi broke his serve, then won the tiebreak 8-6 to secure the victory at 1:15 a.m. He defeated [[Robby Ginepri]], another rising, talented American with a consistent baseline game, in his third consecutive five-set match to earn a spot in the final against World No. 1 [[Roger Federer]]. After losing the first set 6-3, Agassi broke Federer twice to win the second, 6-2. He broke Federer again and at this point looked to be the better player. Agassi had a 30-love lead but with a few costly errors was broken to force a tiebreak, which Federer took, 7-1. Andre ran out of gas which allowed Federer to reel off five straight games.  Being down 5-0 in the fourth set, Agassi held to make it 5-1 before Federer closed it out to win the championship. After the match, Agassi thanked New York for the 20 years of memories, hinting at potential retirement. However, Agassi has made clear that he will only retire on his terms, when he feels that he cannot perform at his best on the court. He will likely continue for another year, as he has qualified for the 2005 Masters Cup (which is limited to the eight best players in the world) and is scheduled to play the lead-in tournament to the 2006 Australian Open.

Coming into the 2005 Masters Cup, Agassi is 29-5 on hard courts (with his only losses coming to [[Roger Federer]] and [[Rafael Nadal]]), and is 5-4 on clay (wins over Gasquet, Ljubicic, and Hrbaty, losses to Coria and Lopez).

In 2005, Agassi left [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with [[Adidas]]. [http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2116135]

Hampered by a third degree ankle injury caused by several torn ligaments, Agassi lost his opening match against Nikolay Davydenko in the Masters Cup and was forced to withdraw. The withdrawal list also included Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, and Marat Safin.

===2006===

Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of an ankle injury. Once he withdrew, he immediately requested a wildcard to enter the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, where he eventually finished as a quarterfinalist losing to [[Guillermo Garcia Lopez]] 4-6, 2-6. 
He was then forced to retire from SAP Open because of a lower back injury causing him severe pain in his lower back and down his legs. 
He then played in the Dubai Open where he won in straight sets over [[Greg Rusedski]] in the first round before losing in straights to German [[Bjorn Phau]] in second round.
Health permitting, Agassi is scheduled to play tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami to close out the winter hardcourt season. Agassi has officially said that he is skipping the entire clay season, since it burdens his body. He will do his best to be ready for Wimbledon. However, Agassi's top priority in 2006 will once again be making yet another run at the US Open in August. Expect all scheduling decisons to be made with that goal in mind.

==Playing style==
Agassi employs a baseline style of play, but unlike most such players, he typically makes contact with the ball ''inside'' the baseline -- exceptionally difficult even for professionals. This is possible because of his short backswing, which also helps him return fast serves. He is also blessed with the best hand and eye coordination, rivaled only by [[Roger Federer]].  [[John McEnroe]] and others have called Agassi the best service returner ever to play professional tennis.

After Agassi's rededication to tennis in 1998, he has focused more on physical conditioning than in the past and is now one of the fittest players on the tour. His upper-body strength allows him to [[bench press]] 350 lbs. He has remarkable endurance and rarely appears tired on court. As long as he is not injured, he handles long, grueling matches arguably better than any other player on the tour (even Roger Federer has been known to tire by the fifth set). Indeed, Agassi is often ready to start the next point when his opponent is catching his breath. One of his strategies is to wear down his opponents, continually putting pressure on them by returning the ball early and deep at angles. Agassi will try to stand in nearly one spot and hit the corners to make his opponent scramble. He will often pass up the winner and hit a slightly less aggressive shot to make his opponent run a little more to retrieve a few more shots. His penchant for running players around point after point has earned him the nickname &quot;The Punisher&quot;. 

Agassi's biggest weakness currently is his lack of consistent speed, and players who are able to consistently hit at sharp angles with pace give him trouble. Agassi used to be one of the fastest players on tour; however, his recent injuries have forced him to consistently run his fastest selectively, usually in Grand Slams and Tennis Masters Series events.  To make up for this recently-adopted weakness, Agassi generally keeps his opponent on the defense. (Federer is the only player with a long winning streak against Agassi; even Sampras lost to Agassi many times).

==Personal and family life==
After a four-year courtship, Agassi married actress Brooke Shields in a lavish ceremony on [[April 19]] 1997. That February, they had filed suit against ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' claiming it printed &quot;false and fabricated&quot; statements: Brooke was undergoing counseling, binge-eating and taking pills; Agassi &quot;lashed into&quot; Brooke and he and Brooke's mother &quot;tangled like wildcats&quot; when she demanded a [[prenuptial agreement|prenup]]; the case was dismissed. Agassi filed for divorce, which was granted on [[April 9]], 1999. 

By the time the divorce was final, Agassi was dating the German tennis legend Steffi Graf.  With only their mothers as witnesses, they were married at his home on [[October 22]], 2001. Their son, [[Jaden Gil Agassi|Jaden Gil]], was born 6 weeks prematurely on [[October 26]] that year. Their daughter, [[Jaz Elle Agassi|Jaz Elle]], was born on [[October 3]] [[2003]].

Agassi's older sister Rita married the former tennis legend [[Pancho Gonzales]]. In 1995, when Gonzales died in Las Vegas, Andre paid for his brother-in-law's funeral.

Andre has participated in many charity organizations, and founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association, which assists the youth of Las Vegas. In 1995, he has won 1995's ATP Arthur Ashe's Humanitarian award in recognition of his efforts helping disadvantaged youth in LA. 

The Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation has always and will continue to fund organizations which offer programs that consistently carry out the mission of the Foundation. The Foundation's mission is to provide educational and recreational institutions and activities for abandoned, abused, and at-risk kids. The following organizations are fine examples:

===The Andre Agassi Boys &amp; Girls Club===
In 1997, Agassi opened the Boys &amp; Girls Club, a 25,000-square-foot facility that features an indoor basketball court, outdoor tennis courts, a computer lab, library and teen centre. It sees as many as 400 children a day in the summer and well over 2,000 during the year. 

Its junior tennis team, Team Agassi, includes mostly players with no previous tennis experience. As of January 2006, the team boasted four nationally ranked players as well as a number of regionally ranked players. Coached by Tim Blenkiron, the group practices regularly, attends study sessions, and often travels to play in various tournaments. The program also encourages members to respect each other and appreciate the challenges of winning and losing.

A basketball program, the Agassi Stars, began in 2000. Headed by Coach Jermone Riley, the Stars are required to attend study hall sessions, write to universities they might be interested in attending, and balance athletics and education.

The Foundation hopes to make these programs a college recruiting ground for kids with academic as well as athletic potential. In a community where drugs and gangs are prevalent forces, the Agassi Club promotes learning and gives kids a safe place to go after school.

== Ethnicity question ==
Agassi's ethnicity, beyond being an American citizen, has been a subject of discussion by fans around the world. His father Mike Agassi is of [[Armenian people|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] ethnicity from the state of Iran, and there have been attempts to &quot;claim&quot; Agassi by both the Armenian and Iranian communities in the United States and abroad. Agassi has often seemed somewhat ambivalent, for example, joking after his &quot;All-Armenian&quot; match against [[Sargis Sargsian]] at the US Open in 2004, &quot;Well, I'm only half-Armenian&quot; [http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/tennis/articles/2004/09/07/armenian_supremacy_for_agassi?mode=PF], though he agreed to appear in a [[PBS]] documentary about [http://www.wliw.org/productions/armenian.html Armenian-Americans]. His father has written in his book, ''The Agassi Story'', about his experience of being an outsider in Muslim Iran, but Andre has also shown interest in the Iranian aspect of his heritage, in February 2005 expressing a desire to visit Iran, which holds &quot;a special place&quot; in his heart.[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/feb/1171.html]

==Quotes==
About Pete Sampras' retirement: &quot;You grow up with a guy, you compete against him for so long, he's such a big part of your career, something that's pretty special, so you do have that sense of personal regret that he's not around any more. You miss having that around.&quot;

During the 2005 US Open: &quot;I've been motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me. There still is plenty out there to get motivated by.&quot;

(from [[Mats Wilander]], asked to name the top 5 tennis players of all time; he placed Agassi, Sampras, Federer, and Borg in the top 4 (in no order) and tied McEnroe, Lendl, and Connors for fifth place): ON AGASSI: ‚ÄúHe has some limitations, like he can‚Äôt serve and volley, yet he has won all four Slams. He has a very high energy level, quite like Borg. He is on fifth gear from the very first point. There is some abnormality in his eyes, otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have had such a phenomenal return. He sees the ball like none else and just guides it wherever he wants to. He‚Äôs just played a Grand Slam final at 35, that tells me he wasted the first five years of his career, otherwise he couldn‚Äôt have lasted this long. No one has done more to tennis than Agassi and Borg.‚Äù

* US Open 2001 quarter-final: lost to Pete Sampras 6-7(9), 7-6(2), 7-6(2), 7-6(5). Match featured no breaks of serve. Many consider this the best Agassi-Sampras match played.
* US Open 2002 final: lost to Pete Sampras 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Sampras' final competitive match.
* French Open 2003 2nd round: defeated [[Mario Ancic]] 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5. Rallied back from two sets to love against the young and powerful Ancic to win the match. One of only six matches Agassi has won after being down two sets to love. Three of them have been at the [[French Open]].
* French Open 2004 1st round: lost to [[Jerome Haehnel]] 4-6, 6-7(4), 3-6. Shock first round loss to lowly French career journeyman. Arguably the greatest upset in French Open history.
* US Open 2004 quarter-final: lost to Roger Federer 3-6, 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, 3-6. 5th set marred by record-breaking winds. By far Roger Federer's most difficult match en route to the title.
* Australian Open 2005 4th round: defeated [[Joachim Johansson]] 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-6(3), 6-4. Won despite Johansson's world-record 51 aces.
* French Open 2005 1st round: lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] 5-7, 6-4, 7-6, 1-6, 0-6.  Possibly Agassi's last match at the French Open.  He led two sets to one heading into the fourth set, but a pinched sciatic nerve hampered Agasi's movement very noticeably. Agassi limped off the court with tears in his eyes after the match. The match was a major indicator to many that Agassi's career might be coming to a close soon.
* US Open 2005 quarter-final: defeated [[James Blake]] 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6(6). Agassi had never come back from two sets down in the US Open. This was called the best match of the 2005 Open and one of the best in US Open history.
* US Open 2005 semi-final: defeated [[Robby Ginepri]] in his third consecutive five-set thriller: 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. At 35 years old, he played his best tennis in the fifth set.
* US Open 2005, final: lost to Roger Federer in his sixth US Open final. In the finale of Agassi's magic run at the Open which included 3 five-set matches in a row, Agassi met Federer and appeared to have the upper hand, being up a break in the third set with the match tied at one set each.  However, Federer withstood the pressure and rallied to beat Agassi 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(1), 6-1.
* Tennis Masters Cup 2005, Round Robin: lost to [[Nikolay Davydenko]] 6-4, 6-2. Agassi was suffering from a sprained ankle injured while he was playing racquetball three weeks before. Although the match itself was unremarkable, the afterward was, when one of the tournament organizers absurdly accused Agassi of faking injury and losing on purpose because he (Agassi) was playing in Shanghai. It turned out that the same injury would cause Agassi to withdraw the 2006 Australian Open.

The '''Austro-Asiatic languages''' are a large [[language family]] of [[Southeast Asia]] and [[India]]. The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for [[South Asia]]. Among these languages, only [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups. 

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. It is widely believed that the Austroasiatic languages are the [[autochthonous]] languages of Southeast Asia and eastern India, and that the other languages of the region, including the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], and [[Sino-Tibetan]] languages, are the result of later [[human migration|migrations of people]]. (There are, for example, Austroasiatic words in the Tibeto-Burman languages of eastern Nepal.) Some linguists have attempted to prove that Austroasiatic languages are related to [[Austronesian languages]], thus forming the [[Austric languages|Austric]] superfamily.

Linguists traditionally recognize two major divisions of Austroasiatic, the [[Mon-Khmer]] languages of Southeast Asia and the [[Munda languages]] of east-central and central India. [[Ethnologue]] identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages, of which 147 are [[Mon-Khmer]] languages and 21 are [[Munda languages]]. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published, and it remains speculative. 

Each of the subdivisions of the classification below that is written in boldface type is accepted as a valid family. However, the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated. It should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review. The classification used here is that of Diffloth (in press), which does not accept traditional Mon-Khmer as a valid unit. 

* [[Munda languages]] ([[India]])
:* '''Koraput''' (7 languages)
:*Core Munda languages
::* '''Kharian-Juang''' (2 languages)
::*North Munda languages
::: '''[[Korku language|Korku]]''' (1 language)

::* Vieto-Katuic languages

::: '''Monic''' (2 languages) includes the [[Mon language]] of [[Myanmar]] and the Nyahkur language of [[Thailand]].

There are in addition several unclassified languages of southern China.

[[Image:Afro-Asiatic.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing the distribution of Afro-Asiatic languages]]
The '''Afro-Asiatic languages''' constitute a [[language family]] of about 240 languages and over 307 million people widespread throughout [[North Africa]], [[East Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].  Other names sometimes given to this family include &quot;Afrasian&quot;, &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; (deprecated), &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972), &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966).

The following language subfamilies are included:

* [[Berber languages]]
* [[Chadic languages]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian languages]]
* [[Semitic languages]]
* [[Cushitic languages]]
* [[Beja language]] (subclassification controversial; widely classified as part of Cushitic)
* [[Omotic languages]] (controversial; sometimes argued to be outside Afro-Asiatic)

The [[Ongota]] language is often considered Afro-Asiatic, but its classification within the family remains controversial, partly for lack of data. [[Harold Fleming]] tentatively suggests that it is an independent branch of non-Omotic Afro-Asiatic.

It is not generally agreed on where [[Proto-Afro-Asiatic]] was spoken; [[Africa]] (e.g., [[Igor Diakonoff]], [[Lionel Bender]]) has often been suggested, particularly [[Ethiopia]], because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afro-Asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin. The western [[Red Sea]] coast and the [[Sahara]] have also been put forward (e.g., [[Christopher Ehret]]).  [[Alexander Militarev]] suggests that their homeland was in the [[Levant]] (specifically, he identifies them with the [[Natufian culture]]).

The Semitic languages are the only Afro-Asiatic subfamily based outside of Africa; however, in historical or near-historical times, some Semitic speakers crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia, so some modern Ethiopian languages (such as [[Amharic]]) are Semitic rather than belonging to the substrate Cushitic or Omotic groups.  (A minority of academics, e.g. A. Murtonen (1967), dispute this view, suggesting that Semitic may have originated in Ethiopia.)

[[Tonal language]]s are found in the Omotic, Chadic, and South &amp; East Cushitic branches of Afro-Asiatic, according to Ehret (1996). The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches are not tonal. 

==Common features and cognates==

Common features of the Afro-Asiatic languages include:
*a two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the /t/ sound,
*[[Verb Subject Object|VSO]] [[linguistic_typology|typology]] with [[Subject Verb Object|SVO]] tendencies,
*a set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive, and
*a templatic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in which words inflect by internal changes as well as prefixes and suffixes.


Some cognates are:
*''b-n-'' &quot;build&quot; (Ehret: *''b&amp;#301;n''), attested in Chadic, Semitic (''*bny''), Cushitic (*''m&amp;#301;n''/*''m&amp;#259;n'' &quot;house&quot;) and Omotic (Dime ''bin-'' &quot;build, create&quot;);
*''m-t'' &quot;die&quot; (Ehret: *''maaw''), attested in Chadic (eg Hausa ''mutu''), Egyptian (''mwt'', ''mt'', Coptic ''mu''), Berber (''mmet'', pr. ''yemmut''), Semitic (*''mwt''), and Cushitic (Proto-Somali *''umaaw''/*''-am-w(t)-'' &quot;die&quot;), also similar to the Latin ''mortis'', indicating a possible vocabulary drift
*''s-n'' &quot;know&quot;, attested in Chadic, Berber, and Egyptian;
*''l-s'' &quot;tongue&quot; (Ehret: ''*lis' ''&quot;to lick&quot;), attested in Semitic (*''lasaan/lisaan''), Egyptian (''ns'', Coptic ''las''), Berber (''ils''), Chadic (eg Hausa ''harshe''), and possibly Omotic (Dime ''lits'-'' &quot;lick&quot;);
*''s-m'' &quot;name&quot; (Ehret: *''s&amp;#365;m'' / *''s&amp;#301;m''), attested in Semitic (*''sm''), Berber (''ism''), Chadic (eg Hausa ''suna''), Cushitic, and Omotic (though the Berber form, ''ism'', and the Omotic form, ''sunts'', are sometimes argued to be Semitic [[loanword]]s.)  The Egyptian ''smi'' &quot;report, announce&quot; may also be cognate.
* ''d-m'' &quot;blood&quot; (Ehret: *''d√Æm'' / *''d√¢m''), attested in Berber (''idammen''), Semitic (*''dam''), Chadic, and arguably Omotic.  Cushitic *''d√Æm''/*''d√¢m'', &quot;red&quot;, may be cognate.


In the verbal system, Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (including Beja) all provide evidence for a prefix conjugation:
{|
|-
| English || Arabic (Semitic) || Kabyle (Berber)
| Saho (Cushitic; verb is &quot;kill&quot;) || Beja (verb is &quot;arrive&quot;)
|-
| he dies || ''yamuutu'' || ''yemmut''
| ''yagdif√©'' || ''iktim''
|-
| she dies || ''tamuutu'' || ''temmut''
| ''yagdif√©'' || ''tiktim''
|-
| they (m.) die || ''yamuutuuna'' || ''mmuten''
| ''yagdif√≠n'' || ''iktimna''
|-
| you (m. sg.) die || ''tamuutu'' || ''temmuted&amp;#803;''
| ''tagdif√©'' || ''tiktima''
|-
| you (m. pl.) die || ''tamuutuuna'' || ''temmutem''
| ''tagdif√≠n'' || ''tiktimna''
|-
| I die || ''&amp;#704;amuutu'' || ''mmute&amp;#947;''
| ''agdif√©'' || ''aktim''
|-
| we die || ''namuutu'' || ''nemmut'' || ''nagdif√©'' || ''niktim''
|}

A causative affix ''s'' is widespread (found in all its subfamilies), but is also found in other groups, such as the [[Niger-Congo languages]].

The [[possessive pronoun]] suffixes are supported by Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic.

==Classification history==

Medieval scholars sometimes linked two or more branches of Afro-Asiatic together; already in the [[9th century]], the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]], [[Algeria]] perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic (the latter being known to him through Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.)

In the 1800's, Europeans began suggesting such relationships; thus in [[1844]] Th. Benfey suggested a language family containing Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;).  In the same year, T. N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.  The traditional &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; family was named by [[Friedrich M√ºller]] in [[1876]] in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'', and defined as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; the Chadic group was not included.  These classifications were partly based on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. (See also [[Hamitic hypothesis]].)

[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) proposed to link Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg; but his suggestion was largely ignored. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct &quot;Hamitic&quot; subgroup, and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.  [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen's rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot;, added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afro-Asiatic for the family; his classification of it came to be almost universally accepted.  In 1969, [[Harold Fleming]] proposed the recognition of [[Omotic]] as a fifth branch, rather than (as previously believed) a subgroup of Cushitic, and this has become generally accepted.  Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic, but this view has yet to gain general acceptance.

There is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned; however, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), [[Harold Fleming]] (1981), and [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1981) all agree that Omotic was the first branch to split from the rest. Otherwise, 
*Ehret groups Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic together in a North Afro-Asiatic subgroup; 
*[[Paul Newman (professor)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic; 
*Fleming (1981) divided non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian; he later added Semitic and Beja to the latter, and proposed [[Ongota language|Ongot√°]] as a tentative new third branch of Erythraean;  
*[[Lionel Bender]] (1997) advocates a &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot; consisting of Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic, while regarding Chadic and Omotic as the most remote branches;
*[[Vladimir Orel]] and [[Olga Stolbova]] (1995) group Berber with Semitic, Chadic with Egyptian, and split Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afro-Asiatic, seeing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a valid family;
*[[Alexander Militarev]] (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both, more distantly, with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.

The '''Principality of Andorra''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Principat d'Andorra'', [[French language|French]]: ''Principaut√© d'Andorre'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Principado de Andorra'') is a small, [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[principality]] in south-western [[Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Once isolated, it is currently a prosperous country mainly because of [[tourism]] and its status as a [[tax haven]].  Andorra is not to be confused with the [[Andora|Comune di Andora]].

== Origin and history of the name ==

The name &quot;Andorra&quot; probably originates from a [[Navarre|Navarrese]] word ''andurrial'', which translates as ''shrub-covered land''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Andorra}}

Tradition holds that [[Charlemagne]] granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the [[Moors]]. Overlordship of the territory passed to the local [[count of Urgell]] and eventually to the [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] of Urgell. In the [[11th century]] a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern French neighbour over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a [[parage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the French [[count of Foix]] (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], in  [[Catalonia]]. This gave the small [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years the title passed to the kings of [[Navarre]].  After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France, he issued an edict (1607) that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra.

In the period 1812‚Äì13, the French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerd√† (d√©partement of S√®gre).

In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On [[July 12]], [[1934]], an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgel. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on [[July 20]] and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco's Spain.
The Franco troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.

During the [[Second World War]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

In 1958 Andorra declared peace with [[Germany]], having been forgotten on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended the [[First World War]] and remaining legally at war.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving [[tourism|tourist]] industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993, the year in which it finally became a member of the United Nations.

== Politics ==
{{main articles|[[Politics of Andorra]] and [[Constitution of Andorra]]}}
{{seealso|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}

Until very recently, Andorra's political system had no clear division of powers into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches. Ratified and approved in 1993, the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co-princes as [[head of state|heads of state]], but the [[head of government]] retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts. They are represented in Andorra by a delegate.

The way in which the two [[prince]]s are chosen makes Andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth. One co-Prince is the man or woman who is currently serving as [[President of France]], currently [[Jacques Chirac]] (it has historically been any Head of State of France, including Kings and Emperors of France). The other is the current [[Catholic]] [[bishop]] of the [[Catalan]] city of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], currently [[Joan Enric Vives i Sicilia]]. As neither prince lives in Andorra their role is almost entirely ceremonial.

Andorra's main legislative body is the [[unicameral]] [[General Council of the Valleys]] (''Consell General de les Valls''), a [[parliament]] of 28 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote, 14 from a single national constituency and 14 to represent each of the 7 parishes, with members serving four-year terms. The Andorran government is formed by the General Council electing the [[Head of Government]] (''Cap de Govern''), who then appoints ministers to the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], the Executive Council (''Govern''). Currently, government is held by the [[Liberal Party of Andorra]], with [[Albert Pintat]] as [[Prime Minister]]. The [[Social Democratic Party (Andorra)|Social Democratic Party]] is in opposition.

Defense of the country is the responsibility of [[France]] and [[Spain]].

== Administrative divisions ==
[[Image:Andorra.geohive.gif|thumb|right|300px|Map of Andorra.]]
{{main|Parishes of Andorra}}

Andorra consists of seven communities, known as ''parr√≤quies'' (singular ''parr√≤quia'' ''[[English Language|Engl.]]:'' parish)
*[[Andorra la Vella]]
*[[Canillo]]
*[[Encamp]]
*[[Escaldes-Engordany]]
*[[La Massana]]
*[[Ordino]]
*[[Sant Juli√† de L√≤ria]]

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Andorra}}

Befitting its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains of an average height of 1,996 m with the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at 2,946 m. These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of 870 m).

Andorra's [[climate]] is similar to its neighbours' [[temperate climate]], but its higher altitude means there is on average more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}

[[Image:AndorraLaVella.jpg|left|190px|Andorra La Vella]]
[[Tourism]], the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter [[resort]]s. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining [[France]] and [[Spain]] have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

The [[banking]] sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy. [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] production is limited&amp;mdash;only 2% of the land is arable&amp;mdash;and most [[food]] has to be [[import]]ed. The principal livestock activity is [[domestic sheep]] raising. [[Manufacturing]] output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.

Andorra is not a full member of the [[European Union]], but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacks a [[currency]] of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations. Prior to 1999 these were the [[French franc]] and the Spanish [[peseta]], which have since been replaced by a single currency, the [[euro]]. Unlike other small European states that use the euro, Andorra does not yet mint its own [[euro coins]]; in October 2004, negotiations between Andorra and the [[European Union|EU]] began on an agreement which would allow Andorra to mint its own coins. Andorra‚Äôs [[natural resource]]s include [[hydropower]], [[mineral water]], [[timber]], [[iron ore]], and [[lead]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}
{{seealso|List of Andorrans}}

Andorrans constitute a minority in their own country; only 33% of inhabitants hold Andorran nationality. The largest group of foreign nationals is that of [[Spain|Spaniards]] (43%), with [[Portugal|Portuguese]] (11%) and [[France|French]] (7%) nationals the other main groups. The remaining 6% belong to several other nationalities.

The only official language is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the language of the nearby Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous region]] of [[Catalonia]], with which Andorra shares many cultural traits, though [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] are also commonly spoken. The predominant religion is [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{seealso|Music of Andorra}}

Andorra's long [[history]] has provided it with a rich [[mythology]] and an abundance of [[Fable|folk tales]], with roots originating in as far as [[Andalusia]] in the south and [[Netherlands]] in the north.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic [[mean]]''' of a set of numbers is the sum of all the members of the set divided by the number of items in the set (cardinality). (The word ''set'' is used perhaps somewhat loosely; for example, the number 3.8 could occur more than once in such a &quot;set&quot;.) If one particular number occurs more times than others in the set, it is called a mode. The arithmetic mean is what pupils are taught very early to call the &quot;[[average]].&quot; If the set is a [[statistical population]], then we speak of the '''population mean'''. If the set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]], we call the resulting [[statistic]] a '''sample mean'''.

When the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median, the set of numbers, or [[frequency distribution]], is said to be [[skewness|skewed]].

The symbol &amp;mu; (Greek: mu) is used to denote the arithmetic mean of a population.

If we denote a set of data by ''X'' = { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then the sample mean is typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable (''xÃÖ'', generally enunciated &quot;''x'' bar&quot;).

In practice, the difference between &amp;mu; and ''xÃÖ'' is that &amp;mu; is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population, and if the sample is drawn randomly, then one may treat ''xÃÖ'', but not &amp;mu;, as a [[random variable]], attributing a [[probability distribution]] to it.

Both are computed in the same way:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mean} = \bar{x} = (x_1+\cdots+x_n)/n.&lt;/math&gt;

The arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s. For instance, reporting the &quot;average&quot; [[net worth]] in [[Redmond, Washington]] as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of [[Bill Gates]]. These distortions occur when the mean is different from the median, and the median is a superior alternative when that happens.

In certain situations, the arithmetic mean is the wrong concept of &quot;average&quot; altogether. For example, if a stock rose 10% in the first year, 30% in the second year and fell 10% in the third year, then it would be incorrect to report its &quot;average&quot; increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean (10% + 30% + (&amp;minus;10%))/3 = 10%; the correct average in this case is the [[geometric mean]] which yields an average increase per year of only 8.8%.

If ''X'' is a [[random variable]], then the [[expected value]] of ''X'' can be seen as the long-term arithmetic mean that occurs on repeated measurements of ''X''. This is the content of the [[law of large numbers]]. As a result, the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values.

Note that several other &quot;means&quot; have been defined, including the [[generalized mean]], the [[generalised f-mean|generalized f-mean]], the [[harmonic mean]], the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], and the [[weighted mean]].

==Alternate notations==
The arithmetic mean may also be expressed using the sum notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AmericanFootballConference.png|right|American Football Conference]]
The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two conferences of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The AFC was created after the league [[AFL-NFL Merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in early 1970. The NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] agreed to join the new AFC along with the 10 former AFL teams. All of the other NFL teams formed the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). Initially, this alignment proved to be very unpopular with fans in these cities.

The AFC logo, shown to the right, is a variation of the old AFL logo [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AmericanFootballLeague.jpg as seen here]. Introduced in 1970 alongside the beginning of the new AFC, the logo has basically remained unchanged since its introduction, though the &quot;A&quot; wasn't as bold when it was first introduced.

The AFC currently consists of 16 teams, organized into four divisions (North, South, East, and West) of four teams each. Each team plays the other teams in their division twice (home and away) during the regular season in addition to 10 other games/teams assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May.  Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team's final record in the previous season.  The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions.  This assignment shifts each year.  For instance, in the [[2006 NFL season|2006 regular season]], each team in the [[AFC East]] will play a game apiece against each team in both the [[AFC South]] and the [[NFC North]].  In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team's prior season record. The NFC operates according to the same system.

At the end of each football [[season (sport)|season]], there are [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non-division-champion teams (&quot;[[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]&quot;) by record). The last two teams remaining play in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC champion plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

'''Albert Arnold Gore, Jr.''' (born [[March 31]], [[1948]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and businessman, who served as the 45th [[Vice President of the United States]] from [[1993]] to [[2001]].  

He [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|ran for President in 2000]] following [[Bill Clinton]]'s two four-year terms. He was defeated in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] vote by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate [[George W. Bush]] on a vote of 271-266 with a Gore committed Elector from [[Washington, DC]] abstaining. However, Gore did receive more individual votes than Bush. The election was bitterly contested, including multiple recounts and a [[Bush v. Gore|5-4 Supreme Court]] decision that effectively secured the election for President [[George W. Bush]]. 

Gore currently serves as President of the American television channel [[Current TV|Current]] and Chairman of [[Generation Investment Management]], sits on the board of directors of [[Apple Computer]], and serves as an unofficial advisor to [[Google]]'s senior management.
Although speculation about a possible [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|presidential run in 2008]] still continues, he has stated that he does not currently plan to return to politics, but doesn't rule this possibility out in the future.

==Early life==
He attended the [[Sheridan school|Sheridan School]], and later the elite [[St. Albans School]]. In 1965, Gore enrolled at [[Harvard College]], where he majored in government. His roommates (in [[Dunster House]]) were actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and former Columbia University women's basketball star Katie Day's father, Bart Day. Gore graduated from Harvard in June 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. 

:For more information on Gore's academic records, see [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;amp;contentId=A37397-2000Mar18]

==Family==
Al Gore was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Albert Gore, Sr.|Albert A. Gore, Sr.]], a politician, and [[Pauline LaFon Gore]], one of the first female lawyers to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.  Since his [[father]] was a veteran Democratic senator from Tennessee, Al Gore, Jr. divided his childhood between Washington, D.C., and [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]], [[Tennessee]].  
During the school year, the younger Gore lived in a [[hotel]] in Washington, during summer vacations, he lived in Carthage, where he worked on the Gore family farm.

In 1970, Gore married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson ([[Tipper Gore]]), whom he had first met many years before at his high school senior [[prom]] (St. Albans School in Washington, D.C.). They have four children: [[Karenna Gore|Karenna]] (born [[August 6]], [[1973]]), married to [[Drew Schiff]]; [[Kristin Gore|Kristin]] (born [[June 5]], [[1977]]); [[Sarah Gore|Sarah]] (born [[January 7]], [[1979]]); and [[Al Gore III|Al III]] (born [[October 19]], [[1982]]). The Gores also have two grandchildren: Wyatt (born [[July 4]], [[1999]]) and Anna Schiff.   

The Gores now reside in [[Nashville]], Tennessee, USA, and own a small farm near Carthage, Tennessee.  The family attends New Salem Missionary [[Baptist Church]] in Carthage. The Gores in late 2005 bought a condo at San Francisco's swanky St. Regis.

==Soldier and journalist==
[[Image:AlGoreVietnam.gif|right|thumb|200px|Gore served as a field reporter in Vietnam for four months.]]

Although opposed to the Vietnam War, on [[August 7]], [[1969]], Gore enlisted in the [[United States Army|army]] to participate in the [[Vietnam War]] effort.  After completing training as a military journalist, Gore shipped to [[Vietnam]] in early 1971, serving for four months before being given an honorable discharge.  The chronology of Gore's military service is as follows:
* '''August 1969''': Enlisted at the [[Newark, New Jersey]] recruiting office.  
* '''August to October 1969''': 8 weeks of basic training at [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]]
* '''Late October 1969 to December 1970''': [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]], on-the-job occupational training at the [[Army Flier]] newspaper.
* '''January 1971 to May 1971''': field reporter in [[Vietnam]], part of the 20th Engineer Brigade, stationed primarily at [[Bien Hoa]] Air Base near [[Saigon]].
* '''[[May 24]], [[1971]]''': Given an honorable discharge, after his early discharge request was granted.

Gore stated many times that he opposed the Vietnam War, but chose to enlist anyway.  Some observers have noted that Gore could have avoided Vietnam in a number of ways.  Gore considered all these options, but said that his sense of civic duty compelled him to serve. [[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]] suggest in ''[[Al Gore: A User's Manual]]'' that Gore joined the military for political gain.

Because Gore served as a journalist, he was never exposed to front-line combat. Although some allege that his famous father's influence helped him to obtain this position, most military analysts agree that any man who enlisted with a Harvard degree had a good chance of being assigned a support specialty rather than an infantry position (even at the war's height, 88% of all servicemen were assigned to noncombatant specialties). However, Gore's decision to enlist for a two year term did mean that he would not be able to select his assignment, a choice which was available to three year enlistees. According to [[Newsweek]] journalist [[Bill Turque]]'s [[biography]] ''[[Inventing Al Gore]]'' (which does not shy away from criticism and scandals, such as charging Gore with smoking [[marijuana]] far more frequently than he admits), 
:''Dess Stokes, staff sergeant at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station on the day he walked in, doesn't remember any communication from superiors about Gore. A kid with Gore's background (a 134 [[IQ]] and a Harvard degree), he said, didn't need to be a senator's son with high-level contacts to get the military job he wanted''. 

Gore's father, [[Al Gore Sr.]], lost the [[U.S. Senate election, 1970|1970 election]], and was no longer a Senator by the time Gore arrived in Vietnam, but was a Senator until January 1971 which included the time his son would have received his assignment. Some critics charge that his father's stature led Gore's superiors to give him less dangerous assignments than they might otherwise have given him. According to combat photographer [[H. Alan Leo]], Gore was protected from dangerous situations at the request of Brigadier General [[Kenneth B. Cooper]], the 20th Engineer Brigades Commander.  Leo stated that Gore's trips into the field were safe, and that Gore &quot;could have worn a tuxedo.&quot;  These remarks seem to contradict Gore's many public statements; 

:&quot;I carried an M-16. I pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass and I was fired upon.&quot;(''[[Baltimore Sun]]'')
:&quot;I took my turn regularly on the perimeter in these little firebases out in the boonies. Something would move, we'd fire first and ask questions later.&quot; (''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'')
:&quot;I was shot at. I spent most of my time in the field.&quot; (''[[Washington Post]]'')
:&quot;I used to fly these things (combat helicopters) with the doors open, sitting on the ledge with our feet hanging down. If you flew low and fast, they wouldn't have as much time to shoot you.&quot;(''[[Weekly Standard]]'') 

For his part, Gore has stated that he knew Leo but rarely traveled with him in Vietnam, and that he never felt that he was being given special protection.  On the other hand, Leo's testimony is that Cooper gave the orders before Gore arrived, so Gore would not know about them.  The question of whether Leo frequently traveled with Gore or not still has not been conclusively answered.

Turque's book, however, states that 
:''[Cooper] said that he has no recollection of even meeting Leo, much less discussing Gore's safety with him. ...''
:''The evidence indicates that if there was an official effort to guarantee Gore's safety, it was uneven at best. His clippings from the Castle Courier, the newspaper of the U.S. Army Engineering Command, and other publications suggest that he pulled his weight, which in his case meant choppering around to report features about the good works of the 20th Engineers... When Smith said he was scheduled to leave for R&amp;amp;R in Hawaii, the sergeant called for volunteers. Gore stepped up and spent a cold night in a foxhole. &quot;Al did what everybody else did,&quot; said Mike O'Hara, the photographer who shot the Khe Sanh assignment...''
:''Regulations allowed for early release of personnel to teach or attend school if their services were deemed &quot;not essential to the mission,&quot; and Gore certainly qualified. ''

Gore stated in 1988 that his experience in Vietnam
:''didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for''.

After returning from Vietnam, Gore spent five years as a [[Journalist|reporter]] for the ''Tennessean'', a newspaper headquartered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  During this time, Gore also attended [[Vanderbilt University| Vanderbilt]] Divinity School and Law School, although he did not complete a degree at either.

==Congress==
[[Image:GoreSenate.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Al Gore speaks during a [[congressional hearing]] in the 1980s.]]
In the spring of 1976, Gore quit law school to run for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]], in [[United States House of Representatives, Tennessee District 4|Tennessee's fourth district]].  Gore defeated [[Stanley Rogers]] in the Democratic primary, then ran unopposed and was elected to his first [[Congress of the United States|Congressional]] post.  He was re-elected three times, in [[U.S. House election, 1978|1978]], [[U.S. House election, 1980|1980]], and [[U.S. House election, 1982|1982]].  In [[U.S. Senate election, 1984|1984]] Gore did not run for the House; instead he successfully ran for a seat in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which had been vacated by Republican Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]].  Gore served as a Senator from Tennessee until 1993, when he became Vice President.

===House of Representatives===
On [[March 19]], [[1979]], Gore became the first person to appear on [[C-SPAN]], making a speech in the House chambers.

===Senate===

===1988 Presidential Run===
In 1988, Gore ran for President but failed to obtain the Democratic nomination, which went instead to [[Michael Dukakis]].

===Son's Accident and effect on 1992 Presidential run===
On [[April 3]], [[1989]], Gore's six-year-old son [[Al Gore III|Albert]] was nearly killed in an automobile accident while leaving the [[Baltimore Orioles]] opening game. Because of this and the resulting lengthy healing process, his father chose to stay near him during the recovery instead of laying the foundation for a presidential primary campaign against eventual nominee Bill Clinton. Gore started writing ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'', his book on environmental conservation, during his son's recovery.  ''Earth in the Balance'' became the first book written by a sitting senator to make ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-seller list since [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''[[Profiles in Courage]]''.

===Congressional Committees===
While in Congress, Gore was a member of the following committees: [[U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] (Defense Industry and Technology Projection Forces and Regional Defense; [[Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence]]); [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce, Science and Transportation]] (Communications; Consumer; Science, Technology and Space- chairman 1992; [[Surface Transportatio]]n; [[National Ocean Policy]] Study); [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Printing|Joint Committee on Printing]]; [[U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]; [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Rules and Administration]].

==Vice Presidency==
[[Image:ClintonGore2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Vice President talking with President Clinton as the two pass through the Colonnade at the White House.]]
[[Bill Clinton]] chose Gore to be his running mate on [[July 9]], [[1992]], to the surprise of many as the two were both young and were from the same region of the nation.  After winning the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], Al Gore was inaugurated as the 45th Vice President of the United States on [[January 20]], [[1993]]. Clinton and Gore were re-elected to a second term in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election]].

During his time as Vice President, Al Gore was mostly a behind the scenes player.  However, many experts consider him to be one of the most active and influential Vice Presidents in U.S. history. This was evident as Gore had weekly lunches with Clinton to keep each other abreast of current developments, although he later said that it was he who insisted on having those weekly lunches in the first place.

===Debate with Perot===
In 1993 Gore debated [[Ross Perot]] on [[CNN]]'s [[Larry King Live]] on the issue of [[free trade]]. Public opinion polls taken after the debate showed that a majority of Americans agreed with his point of view and supported [[NAFTA]]. Some claim that this performance may have been responsible for the passing of NAFTA in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where it passed 234-200. [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/reinventing_government.html]

===Initatives===
One of Gore's major accomplishments as Vice President was the ''National Performance Review'', which pointed out waste, fraud, and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the [[bureaucracy]] and the number of regulations.  His book later helped guide President Clinton when he down sized the [[federal government]]. [http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/speeches/interego.html]  

====Internet Education====
As Vice President, Gore instituted a federal program calling for all schools and libraries to be wired to the [[Internet]]. This was a culmination of work that he had started several years before. While serving in the Senate, Gore had introduced legislation which called for the creation of a new federal research center for educational computing to support an &quot;information systems highway&quot;. [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/technology.html]

====Environment====
During Gore's tenure as Vice President, he was a strong proponent for environmental protection. While a senator working on his book ''Earth in the Balance'', Gore had traveled around the world on numerous fact-finding  missions. On [[Earth Day]] 1994, Gore launched the worldwide [[GLOBE program]], an innovative hands-on, school-based education and science activity that made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment and contribute research data for scientists.

The opinions he developed on issues such as global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the destruction of rain forests is said to have played a major role in policy making for the Clinton administration. In the late nineties, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the [[Kyoto Treaty]], which called for reduction in green house emissions. [http://web.archive.org/web/20001207090900/www.algore.com/speeches/speeches_kyoto_120897.html], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/environment.html]

====Foreign Policy====
Because of President Clinton's inexperience and Gore's service in Vietnam and in the Senate, Clinton would often look to Gore for advice in the area of foreign policy.  Gore was one of the first to call for action to remove Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá]] from power in 1998.  Gore also supported [[Operation Desert Fox]], a three day bombing campaign against Iraq that attempted to &quot;degrade Saddam Hussein's ability to make and to use weapons of mass destruction.&quot; [http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/desert_fox/], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/foreign_policy.html]

[[Image:Algoreyasser.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Vice President Al Gore works along side President Clinton in trying to negotiate a Middle East peace plan with Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]].]]

====Other====
During the Clinton/Gore administration, Americans enjoyed eight years of relative peace along with the longest economic expansion in history.  Democrats attributed this prosperity to the policies of the Clinton/Gore administration, and especially to the passage of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], for which Gore cast the [[U.S. Vice President's tie-breaking votes|tie-breaking vote]].  During his 2000 campaign for the presidency, Gore attributed several positive economic results to his and Clinton's policies [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/economy.html]  more than 22 million new jobs, highest homeownership in American history, Lowest unemployment in 30 years, Paid off $360 billion of the national debt, lowest poverty rate in 20 years, higher incomes at all levels, converted the largest budget deficit, up to that time, in American history to the largest surplus, lowest government spending in three decades, lowest federal income tax burden in 35 years, and more families own stock than ever before.  However Gore later placed a large share of the blame for his election loss on the economic downturn and NASDAQ crash of March 2000 in an interview with [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Bob Edwards]]. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=848572]

==2000 presidential election==
{{main articles|[[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 2000]]}}
[[Image:Goreconvention.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Al Gore and running-mate Joe Lieberman at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]].]]
After two terms as Vice President, Gore ran for [[President of the United States|President]]. In the Democratic primaries, Gore faced an early challenge from [[Bill Bradley]]. Gore's nomination was never really in doubt and Bradley withdrew from the race in early March 2000 after failing to win any state primary or caucus. 

In August 2000, Gore surprised many when he selected United States Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] to be his vice-presidential running mate. Lieberman, who is a more conservative Democrat than Gore, had publicly blasted President Clinton for the [[Monica Lewinsky]] affair. Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandal-prone Clinton White House. Lieberman was also the first Jewish nominee on a major party's national ticket.

During the entire campaign, Gore was neck-and-neck in the polls with [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Governor of Texas]] [[George W. Bush]].  On Election Day, the results were so close that the outcome of the race took over a month to resolve, highlighted by the premature declaration of a winner on election night, and an extremely close result in the state of [[Florida]]. On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, then Fox News decided to call it for Bush and all of the other news stations followed their decision.

The race was ultimately decided by a razor thin margin of only 537 popular votes in Florida, a state favored to have gone to Bush (as his brother served as Governor).  The 537 number was an astonishingly close margin out of some 105 million votes cast nationwide. Florida's 25 electoral votes were awarded to George W. Bush only after numerous court challenges. Al Gore publicly conceded the election after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' voted 7 to 2 to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional because it feared that different standards would be used in different parts of the state, and 5 to 4 to ban recounts using other procedures.  [[Image:Gore_Debate.jpg|thumb|200px|Al Gore makes a point during a [[U.S. presidential debate|presidential debate]] during the 2000 election as George W. Bush looks on.]] Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but decided &quot;for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.&quot;  He had previously made a concession phone call to Bush the night of the election, but quickly retracted it after learning just how close the election was. Following the election, a subsequent recount conducted by various U.S. news media organizations indicated that Mr. Bush would have won using the partial recount method of 4 strongly Democratic areas advocated by Mr. Gore, but that Mr. Gore would have won given a full recount of the state. [http://www.bushwatch.com/gorebush.htm][http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/florida.ballots/stories/main.html].

The states that ultimately voted for Gore over Bush in the 2000 elections were New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota and Hawaii giving Gore 267 electoral votes to Bush's 271. One of Gore's electors cast a blank ballot, to protest what she called DC's &quot;colonial status&quot;, thus the candidate's final number of electoral votes was 266.

The Florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election. Critics have argued that the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush (Brother of George W. Bush) and the Secretary of State of Florida, Katherine Harris, did play a part in ensuring that the state was in the red column of the Republicans come election day. Several irregularities are thought to have favored Bush; others may have given Gore an edge. Irregularities favoring Bush included the notorious Palm Beach &quot;butterfly ballots&quot;, which were alleged to have produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]], and a purge of some 50,000 alleged felons from the Florida voting rolls that included some voters who were again eligible to vote under Florida law. Many Bush supporters, however, believed that an unfair advantage was given to Gore when all major news networks, early on, prematurely projected Gore as the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes at 7:52 PM Eastern Time.  This happened before the polls closed in 10 Florida counties in the heavily Republican western panhandle which are in the Central Time Zone, and thus closed at 7 PM Central Time (8 PM Eastern).  Some have thought that this depressed the pro-Bush vote in that area. [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/02/02/cnn.report/cnn.pdf] During the numerous recounts (which made the phrase &quot;hanging chads&quot; infamous in the American vocabulary), there were also allegations of both pro-Bush and pro-Gore tampering by low-level operatives in the controversial counties. [http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2000/11/26/230955.shtml] It is unclear what effect, if any, this may have had.  And while the Gore camp fought (with some success) to keep overseas absentee votes out in counties thought to be pro-Bush, Bush operatives similarly (albeit while drawing less attention to their efforts) prevented the counting of overseas absentee votes in strong Democratic counties.  Both sides contended that the votes were cast after Election Day, and since many of the envelopes did not have cancelled stamps, it was not clear when the votes were cast.  Reports later surfaced that many overseas voters attempted to vote only after learning of the closeness of the Florida vote.

Some commentators still see such irregularities, and the legal maneuvering around the recounts as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the vote; as a matter of law, however, the issue was settled, albeit controversially again, when the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] accepted Florida's electoral delegation, only after a challenge to the Florida electors was presented in the congressional chambers on [[January 6]], [[2001]] by members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]. Member after member went up decrying the lack of a senator who would be willing to co-sponsor the challenge without any effect. They thus failed to bring the challenge to a debate.  

Concern about the possible disenfranchisement of voters in the Florida vote led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the United States, and ultimately to the passage of the [[Help America Vote Act]], which authorized the [[United States federal government]] to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with [[electronic voting]] equipment. However, this has led to new controversies, because of the security weaknesses of the computer systems, the lack of paper-based methods of secure verification, and the necessity to rely on the trustworthiness of the manufacturers whose employees also count those votes.
Although Gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, he lost the election by five electoral votes (with one D.C. elector, pledged to Gore, casting a blank ballot to protest the District's lack of representation in Congress).

Joe Lieberman later criticized Al Gore for adopting a populist theme during their 2000 campaign. Lieberman said he objected to Gore's &quot;people vs. the powerful&quot; message, believing it was not the best strategy for Democrats to use to recapture the White House.[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28519]

While running for president in 2000, Al Gore was used as a voice actor for the television show ''[[Futurama]]'' (for which his daughter, Kristin, was a writer). He played [[Recurring characters of Futurama#Al Gore|himself]] again in another episode after the campaign was over.

==Private citizen==
===Professor Gore===
[[Image:Goreharvard2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|left|Al Gore re-emerges in 2001 as a visiting professor with a [[beard]].]]
Following his election loss, Gore accepted visiting [[professor]]ships at [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism]], [[Middle Tennessee State University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], and [[Fisk University]]. In late 2001, Al Gore became a Senior Advisor to [[Google|Google]] and Vice Chairman of [[Los Angeles]]-based financial firm [[Metropolitan West Financial LLC]].

===Blasting Bush===
On [[September 23]], 2002, Gore spoke in [[San Francisco]] to The [[Commonwealth Club]] and made a controversial speech blasting Bush on the Iraq war [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002-09-23-gore_x.htm] Although he admitted Saddam was a potential danger saying: &quot;We know that [Saddam] has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power&quot;[http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html]  He also spoke against rushing to war with Iraq, advising caution and saying that Iraq was a diversion from fighting Al-Qaeda and terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere: &quot;I don't think that we should allow anything to diminish our focus on avenging the 3,000 Americans who were murdered and dismantling the network of terrorists who we know to be responsible for it. The fact that we don't know where they are should not cause us to focus instead on some other enemy whose location may be easier to identify.&quot;

Following the [[November 5]], [[2002]], midterm elections Gore re-emerged into the public eye with a 14-city book tour and a well-orchestrated &quot;full Gore&quot; media blitz which included a pair of policy speeches. On [[September 23]], Gore delivered a speech on the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|War with Iraq]] and the [[War on Terrorism]] that generated a fair amount of commentary. Less than two weeks later, on October 2, he made a speech on Bush's handling of the economy to the [[Brookings Institution]]. Also, during this time period Gore guest starred on several programs such as [[The Late Show with David Letterman]] and [[Saturday Night Live]] (with legendary rock band [[Phish]]), appearing much more relaxed and funnier as a private citizen than he did while holding public office.

[[Image:Goresnl.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Al Gore hosting ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' along side ''[[The West Wing (television)|West Wing]]'' stars [[Martin Sheen]] and [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]].]]
In 2003 Gore joined the board of directors of [[Apple Computer]].  On the political front, Gore kept his promise of staying involved in public debate when he offered his criticism and advice to the [[Bush Administration]] on key topics such as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq]], [[USA Patriot Act]], and [[natural environment|environmental]] issues, most notably [[global warming]].  Gore also continued to visit campuses across the nation lecturing on issues such as [[race]], [[media]], and [[democracy]].

On [[April 10]], [[2004]], Gore met with the [[9-11 Commission]] in private to give his testimony on what his administration did to prevent terror attacks. In a statement after the three-hour session, the commission said he was candid and forthcoming, and it thanked him for his &quot;continued cooperation.&quot;

In the summer of 2004, Gore teamed up with [[MoveOn.org]], to promote the new science fiction film, [[The Day After Tomorrow|''The Day After Tomorrow'']].  Although Gore said the movie was a far-fetched example of global warming, he said the movie would escalate public debate on the issue.

On [[April 27]], [[2005]], Gore gave an hour-long speech lambasting the GOP's effort to do away with the legislative [[filibuster]].  In response to Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]], who for weeks had repeated threats to impose the &quot;[[nuclear option]]&quot; if [[Senate]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] did not stop blocking judicial nominees via the filibuster, Gore said, &quot;Their grand design is an all-powerful executive using a weakened [[legislature]] to fashion a compliant judiciary in its own image. The Senate has confirmed 205 or over 95% of President Bush's nominees.  Democrats have held up only 10 nominees, less than 5%. Compare that with the 60 Clinton nominees who were blocked by Republican obstruction between 1995 and 2000.  What is involved here is a power grab,&quot; Gore said.  Gore also took aim at what he called &quot;religious zealots&quot; who claim special knowledge of [[god (monotheism)|God's]] will in [[American politics]].  He went on to say, &quot;They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith. How dare they!&quot;  This was Gore's first major policy speech of 2005 and also the first one since the defeat of Democratic hopeful John Kerry in late 2004.

In May 2005, Gore was awarded a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the Internet.  The [[Webby Awards]], which are widely hailed as the ''[[Oscars]]'' of the web, &quot;wanted to set the record straight&quot; about Al Gore and the Internet once and for all.   [[Tiffany Shlain]], the awards' founder and chairwoman said, &quot;It's just one of those instances someone did amazing work for three decades as congressman, senator and vice president and it got spun around into this political mess,&quot; Shlain said. [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-05-04-gore-webby_x.htm]

In September 2005, Gore chartered two aircraft to evacuate 270 evacuees from New Orleans in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-katrina-gore,1,535141.story?coll=sns-ap-nation-headlines&amp;amp;ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true] He was highly critical of the government and federal response in the days after the hurricane.

===Future===
Speaking at an economic forum in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], in October 2005, Gore again stated that he has no intention of ever running for president again in response to questions from reporters.  However, Gore said he could not rule the possibility out completely saying, &quot;I do not completely rule out some future interest, but I do not expect to have that.&quot; When asked how the United States would have been different if he had become president, Gore stated, &quot;We would not have invaded a country that didn't attack us,&quot; he said, referring to Iraq. &quot;We would not have taken money from the working families and given it to the most wealthy families.&quot; &quot;We would not be trying to control and intimidate the news media. We would not be routinely torturing people,&quot; Gore said. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/12/politics/main938098.shtml]

In the past few years, Gore has remained busy traveling the world speaking and participating in events mainly aimed towards global warming awareness and prevention.

On January 2006, Al Gore delivered a major speech criticising President Bush's use of domestic wiretaps. Gore stated that Bush broke the law and recommended an independent counsel investigate the matter further. Also in January 2006, Al Gore was the leading man in the Sundance global warming documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. 

Al Gore will be publishing a second book on global warming titled &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; in April 2006. 

On February 12, 2006: Former US vice-president Al Gore on Sunday said that the US government had committed ‚Äòterrible abuses‚Äô against Arabs living in America after 9/11 attacks, and that most Americans did not support such treatment.

‚ÄúThe thoughtless way in which visas are now handled, that is a mistake,‚Äù Mr Gore said at the Jeddah Economic Forum. ‚ÄúThe worst thing we can possibly do is to cut off the channels of friendship and mutual understanding between Saudi Arabia and the United States.‚Äù

The former US vice-president told this Saudi audience, many of them educated in US universities, that Arabs in the United States had been ‚Äúindiscriminately rounded up, often on minor charges of overstaying a visa or not having a green card in proper order, and held in conditions that were just unforgivable.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it‚Äôs wrong. I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country.‚Äù

Terrence Jeffrey of [[Human Events]] and [[Jack Kelly]] of [[RealClearPolitics.com]] however criticized Gore's comments, and pointed out that [[9/11 Commission]] (page 492) reported that [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who planned the attacks, told interrogators most of the hijackers he selected were Saudis because they had the easiest time getting visas. [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-2_17_06_JKE.html] [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004544.htm] [[Mohammad Atta]] himself was in the United States, having overstayed his visa.

====Television network====
{{main|Current TV}}
[[Image:Current.png|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore's ''Current'' official logo.]]
On [[May 4]], [[2004]], [[INdTV]] Holdings, a company co-founded by Gore and [[Joel Hyatt]], purchased cable news channel [[NewsWorld International]] from [[Vivendi Universal]].  The new network will not have political leanings, Gore said, but will serve as an &quot;independent voice&quot; for a target audience of people between 18 and 34 &quot;who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own.&quot; The network was relaunched under the name [[Current TV|Current]] on [[August 1]], [[2005]].

====Investment firm====
In late 2004, it was announced that Al Gore had launched and will chair an investment firm to seek out companies taking a responsible view on big global issues like [[climate change]].

Gore's group, [[Generation Investment Management]], was created to assist the growing demand for an investment style which can bring returns by blending traditional equity research with a focus on more intangible non-financial factors such as social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance.

==2004 presidential election==
===Endorsing Dean===
[[Image:AlGoreHowardDean.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore shocked many when he did not endorse his 2000 running mate Joe Lieberman, but the outsider candidate, Howard Dean, in 2003.]]
Initially, Al Gore was touted as a logical opponent of George W. Bush in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election]]. &lt;!-- &quot;Re-elect Gore!&quot; was a common slogan among many Democrats who felt the former Vice President had been unfairly cheated out of the presidency, on the grounds that he had won the popular vote and (in the opinion of many){{fact}} should have won the Electoral College vote. --&gt;  On [[December 16]], [[2002]] however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004, saying that it was time for &quot;fresh faces&quot; and &quot;new ideas&quot; to emerge from the Democrats. When he appeared on a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, Gore said that he felt if he had run, the focus of the election would be the rematch rather than the issues. Gore's former running mate, Joe Lieberman quickly announced his own candidacy for the presidency, which he had vowed he would not do if Gore ran.

Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to &quot;[[political draft|draft]]&quot; him into running.  However, that effort largely came to an end when Gore publicly endorsed [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont Governor]] [[Howard Dean]] (over his former running mate [[Joe Lieberman]]) weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. There was still some effort to encourage write-in votes for Gore in the primaries by a different group of Gore supporters who were separate from the draft movement. Although Gore did receive a small number of votes in New Hampshire and New Mexico, that effort was halted when [[John Kerry]] pulled into the lead for the nomination. Gore's endorsement of Dean was helpful to the latter in legitimizing him in the eyes of the establishment faction of the Democratic Party, but it also led the media to dub Dean as the clear front-runner, with the result that his opponents devoted more of their emphasis to opposing him.

===Campaigning against Bush===
On [[January 15]], [[2004]], Al Gore gave a major policy address in [[New York City]] on [[climate change]] and the Bush administration's approach to the environment.  Accompanied by slides and projector, Gore slammed the Bush administration's attitude towards global warming saying, &quot;There are many who still do not believe that global warming is a problem at all. And it's no wonder: because they are the targets of a massive and well-organized campaign of disinformation lavishly funded by polluters who are determined to prevent any action to reduce the [[greenhouse gas]] [[emissions]] that cause global warming, out of a fear that their profits might be affected if they had to stop dumping so much pollution into the atmosphere.&quot;

On [[February 9]], [[2004]], on the eve of the [[Tennessee]] primary, Gore gave what many consider his harshest criticism of the president yet when he accused [[George W. Bush]] of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. &quot;He betrayed this country!&quot; Mr. Gore shouted into the microphone.  &quot;He played on our fears! He took America on an ill-conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops, an adventure preordained and planned before 9/11 ever took place!&quot;  Gore also urged all Democrats to unite behind their eventual nominee proclaiming, &quot;Any one of these candidates is far better than George W. Bush.&quot;  In [[March 2004]] Gore, along with former Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], united behind Kerry as the presumptive Democratic nominee.

[[Image:AlGoreSpeaking2004.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore, who just four years prior accepted his party's nomination, speaks as a party elder at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.]]

On [[April 28]], [[2004]], Gore announced that he would be donating $6 million to various Democratic Party groups.  Drawing from his funds left over from his [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]], Gore pledged to donate $4 million to the [[Democratic National Committee]]. The party's Senate and House committees would each get $1 million, and the party from Gore's home state of [[Tennessee]] would receive $250,000. In addition, Gore announced that all of the surplus funds in his &quot;Recount Fund&quot; from the 2000 election controversy that resulted in the Supreme Court halting the counting of the ballots, a total of $240,000, will be donated to the [[Florida]] Democratic Party.

In his speech, Gore stressed the importance of voting and having every vote counted, a point that foreshadowed the [[2004 U.S. election voting controversies]].

On [[May 26]], [[2004]], Gore gave a highly critical speech on the Iraq crisis and the [[Bush Administration]].  In the speech, Gore demanded [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[George Tenet]], [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Undersecretary of Defense for Policy]] [[Douglas Feith]], and [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] [[Stephen Cambone]] all resign for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad.  During the fiery speech, which lasted more than an hour, Gore called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan &quot;incompetent&quot; and called George W. Bush the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]], who resigned the office of the presidency in 1974 following the [[Watergate]] scandal. 

Gore also decried the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq]], saying, &quot;What happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy.&quot;

====Convention====
As the first major speaker at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]], Gore held himself out as a living reminder that every vote counts.  &quot;Let's make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president, but also that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court,&quot; said Gore.  Gore directed remarks to supporters of third-party presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]], who abandoned the Democratic Party four years ago, asking them, &quot;Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?&quot;

====Post-Convention====
On [[October 18]], 2004, Al Gore delivered his final major policy speech of the 2004 political season.  In an hour long presentation, Gore concluded that, &quot;I'm convinced that most of the president's frequent departures from fact-based analysis have much more to do with right-wing political and economic [[ideology]] than with the [[Bible]].&quot;

==Views and controversies==
{{main|Al Gore controversies}}
Gore is a strong supporter of [[abortion]] rights, [[free trade]], and strong [[environmentalism|environmental]] policy. He was a vocal opponent of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] [http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html].
Gore has gradually moved politically further [[Left-wing politics | left]]; he was once a moderate-to-conservative lawmaker. While in Congress, Gore had a strong pro-life record on abortion and voted pro-life 27 times. When exactly Gore became pro-choice is unknown, but by 1988, when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination, he was on record as opposing the criminalization of abortion.

Critics have charged Gore with [[1996 U.S. campaign finance scandal|illegal fundraising]] at a Buddhist temple and illegal use of his government office and telephone for political fundraising in violation of the Hatch Act, although he was never indicted on such a charge.

===The Internet===
Gore is a frequent target of satire, based on his supposedly having claimed to have invented the Internet. In fact he never made such a claim [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp]. Rather, during an interview with [[Wolf Blitzer]] on [[CNN]]'s &quot;Late Edition&quot; on March 9, 1999, Gore stated:

: During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/03/09/president.2000/transcript.gore].

The phrase from the statement above which sparked the debate, &quot;I took the initiative in creating the Internet,&quot; referred to Gore's involvement with and  sponsorship of the ''High Performance Computing Act of 1991'' which advanced the growth and mainstreaming of the Internet during the [[1990s]] [http://www.mit.edu/afs/net.mit.edu/dev/mit/jis/OldFiles/nrenbill.txt]. 

This statement was later defended by Internet pioneers [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]] and [[Vinton Cerf]] [http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200009/msg00052.html]:

: ...as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the Internet work, we would like to acknowledge VP Gore's contributions as a Congressman, Senator and as Vice President.  No other elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time.

===Accusations of hypocrisy by McClellan and Gonzales===
On the 16th of January, 2006, Gore accused U.S. [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] of &quot;breaking the law repeatedly and insistently,&quot; and called for a special investigation of [[NSA]] spying on Americans because the spying was without a warrant from a special federal court that authorizes such requests to eavesdrop on Americans.

Bush press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] and Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] both responded to reporters that the Clinton-Gore administration had done illegal warrantless physical searches themselves of [[Aldrich Ames]] without permission from a judge. 

&quot;I think his hypocrisy knows no bounds,&quot; McClellan said of Gore. But the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] at the time did not cover physical searches. The law had changed in 1995. Gore claimed that because Gonzales made a &quot;political defense&quot; for Bush, he was no longer eligible to review charges against Bush and therefore must name a [[special counsel]]. 

&quot;His charges are factually wrong,&quot; said Gore, &quot;Both before and after the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] was amended in 1995; the Clinton-Gore administration complied fully and completely with the terms of the law.&quot; [http://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/01/17/ap2456266.html]

'''Animal Farm''' is a [[satire|satirical]] [[novel]] (which can also be understood as a modern [[fable]] or [[allegory]]) by [[George Orwell]], ostensibly about a group of animals who oust the humans from the [[farm]] they live on and run it themselves, only to have it corrupted into a brutal tyranny on its own. It was written during [[World War II]] and published in 1945, although it was not widely successful until the late [[1950s]].

''Animal Farm'' is a thinly veiled critique and satire of Soviet [[totalitarianism]]. Many events in the book are based on events from the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Stalin]] era.  Orwell, though a leftist ‚Äî he was for many years a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]] ‚Äî was a critic of Stalin, and suspicious of Moscow-directed communism after his experiences in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
When the farm's prize-winning pig, [[Old Major]], calls a meeting of all the animals of Manor Farm, he tells them that he has had a dream in which mankind is gone, and animals are free to live in peace and harmony. He compares the humans to parasites, and then proceeds to teach the animals a [[revolution]]ary song, &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot;. The other animals begin to hope and dream for the revolution of such a day. When Old Major dies, a mere three days later, three pigs -- [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] (who teaches the animals to read), [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], and [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] -- assume command, and turn his dream into a full-fledged philosophy. One night, the starved animals suddenly revolt and drive the farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]], his wife, and his pet raven off the farm and take control. The farm is renamed &quot;Animal Farm&quot; as the animals work towards a future [[utopia]]. The [[Seven Commandments]] of the new philosophy of [[Animalism]] are written on the wall of a barn for all to read, the seventh and most important of which is that &quot;all animals are equal&quot;. All animals work, but the [[horse|workhorse]] [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] does more than his fair share and adopts a [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] of his own ‚Äî &quot;I will work harder.&quot;

Animal Farm is off to a great start. Snowball teaches the other animals to [[reading (activity)|read]] and write (though few animals besides the pigs learn to read well), food is plentiful due to a good harvest, and the entire Farm is organized and running smoothly. Even when Mr. Jones tries his last-ditch effort to retake control of the farm, the animals easily defeat him at what they later call the &quot;[[Battle of the Cowshed]]&quot;. Soon, however, things begin to unravel as Napoleon and Snowball begin an epic power struggle over the farm. When Snowball announces his idea for a [[windmill]], Napoleon quickly opposes it. A meeting is held, and when Snowball makes his passionate and articulate speech in favour of the windmill, Napoleon only makes a brief retort and then makes a strange noise to call in nine attack dogs. They burst in and chase Snowball off of the farm. In his absence, Napoleon declares himself the leader of the farm and makes instant changes. He announces that meetings will no longer be held as before, and a committee of pigs alone will decide what happens with the farm.

Napoleon changes his mind about the windmill, claiming (through Squealer) that Snowball stole the idea from him, and the animals begin to work. After a violent [[storm]], the animals wake to find the fruit of their months of labour utterly annihilated. Though neighbouring [[farmer]]s scoff at the thin walls, Napoleon and Squealer convince everyone that Snowball destroyed it. Napoleon begins to purge the farm, killing many animals he accuses of consorting with Snowball. In the meantime, Boxer takes a second [[mantra]], &quot;Napoleon is always right.&quot; 

Napoleon begins to abuse his powers even more and life on the farm becomes harder and harder for the rest of the animals. The pigs impose more and more controls on them while reserving [[privilege]]s for themselves. History is rewritten to villainise Snowball and glorify Napoleon even further. Each step of this development is justified by the pig, Squealer, who on several occasions alters the Seven Commandments on the barn in the dead of night. The song &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned as inappropriate now that the dream of Animal Farm has been realised, and is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon who begins to live more and more like a human. The animals, though cold, starving, and overworked, remain convinced that they are still better off than when they were ruled by a man named Jones.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]], one of the two neighbouring farmers, swindles Napoleon by paying with forged banknotes, and then attacks the farm and uses [[dynamite]] to blow up the recently restored windmill. Though the animals of Animal Farm eventually win the battle, they do so at a great cost, as many of the animals, including Boxer, are wounded. However, Boxer continues to work harder and harder, until he finally collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to come and take Boxer to the veterinarian, but as Boxer is loaded up and the van drives away, the animals read what is written on the side of the van: &quot;Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler.&quot; Squealer quickly reports that the van with the old writing has been purchased by the hospital, and later that Boxer has died in the hospital, in spite of the best medical care. 

Many years pass, and the pigs learn to walk upright, carry [[whip]]s, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs, and the humans of the area (in the adjacent Foxwood Farm run by Mr. [[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Pilkington]]). He announces his alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both &quot;worlds&quot;.

The animals discover this when they overhear Napoleon's conversations and finally realize that a change has come over the ruling pigs. During a poker match, an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington when they both play an [[Ace of Spades]], and the animals realise how they cannot tell the difference between the pigs and the humans.

The pigs walked on two feet and they adopted many of Mr. Jones' customs and principles. The pigs have violated every one of the rules set out in the beginning which they set up. This is when we come to the theme of this book: power corrupts.

==Plot references to real events==
*The ousting of the Humans after the farmers forget to feed the animals ‚Äì [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] led to the removal of the Tsars after a series of famine and poverty.
*The refusal of the Humans to refer to Animal Farm by its new name (still calling it Manor Farm) may be indicative of the diplomatic limbo in which the Soviets existed following their early history. 
*Mr. Jones' last ditch effort to re-take the farm (The Battle of the Cowshed) ‚Äì [[Russian Civil War]] in which the western capitalist governments sent soldiers to try to remove the Bolsheviks from power.
*Napoleon's removal of Snowball ‚Äì [[Stalin]]‚Äôs removal of [[Leon Trotsky]] from power in 1927 and his subsequent expulsion.
*Napoleon stealing Snowball‚Äôs idea for a windmill ‚Äì Stalin later shifted away from &quot;[[World revolution|World Socialism]]&quot; to &quot;[[Socialism in one country]]&quot; which Trotsky had originally promoted. The windmill can also be considered a symbol of the Soviet [[Five-Year Plan|Five-Year Plans]], a concept developed by Trotsky and adopted by Stalin, who claimed them to be his idea.
*Moses the raven leaving the farm for a while and then returning ‚Äî Similar to the Russian Orthodox Church going underground and then being brought back to give the workers hope.
*Boxer's motto, &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot; is strikingly similar to &quot;Mussolini is always right&quot; a chant used to hail [[Benito Mussolini]] during his rule of [[Italy]] from 1922 to 1943.
*During the rise of Napoleon, he ordered the collection of all the hens' eggs. In an act of defiance, the Hens destroyed their eggs rather than give them to Napoleon ‚Äî During Stalin's [[collectivization]] period in the early 1930s, many Ukrainian peasants burned their crops and farms rather than handing them over to the government.
*Napoleon's mass executions, of which many were unfair for the alleged crimes ‚Äî [[Stalin]] executed his political enemies for various crimes after they were tortured and forced to falsely confess.
*The four pigs that go against Napoleon's will represent the [[White movement]].
*Napoleon's replacement of the farm anthem &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot; with an inane composition by the pig poet Minimus (&quot;Animal Farm, Animal Farm / Never through me / Will you come to harm&quot;) ‚Äì In 1943, Stalin replaced the old national anthem &quot;[[the Internationale]]&quot; with &quot;the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|Hymn of the Soviet Union]].&quot; The old internationale glorified the revolution and &quot;the people.&quot; The original version of the Hymn of the Soviet Union glorified Stalin so heavily that after his death in 1953, entire sections of the anthem had to be replaced or removed. Orwell could have also been referring to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s banning of the French national hymn, [[La Marseillaise]] in 1799.
*Napoleon's dealing with Mr. Frederick, who eventually betrays Animal Farm and destroys the windmill. Though Animal Farm repels the human attack, many animals are wounded and killed ‚Äî Stalin‚Äôs [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, which was later betrayed in 1941 when [[Operation Barbarossa|Hitler invaded the Soviet Union]]. Though the Soviet Union won the war, it came at a tremendous price of roughly 8.5-15 million Soviet soldiers (unconfirmed) and many civilians, coming to an incredible estimated 20 million dead, as well as the utter destruction of the Western Soviet Union and its prized collective farms which Stalin had created in the 1930s.
*Napoleon's later alliance with the humans ‚Äî Stalin‚Äôs non-aggression pact with Hitler in the early years of WWII.
*Napoleon's changing Animal Farm back to Manor ‚Äî The [[Red Army]]‚Äôs name was changed from the &quot;Workers' and Peasants' Red Army&quot; to the &quot;Soviet Army&quot; to appear as a more appealing and professional organization rather than an army of the common people. 
*After Old Major dies, his skull is placed on display on a tree stump. Similarly, [[Vladmir Lenin|Lenin's]] (whom Old Major is based on along with Karl Marx) embalmed body was put on display in [[Lenin's mausoleum|Lenin's Tomb]] in [[Red Square]] postmortem, where it still remains.
*Squealer, constantly changing the commandments, is said to be a reference to a perversion in Russian religious history, as observed by [[Leo Tolstoy]] when the essential precepts of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] were altered by [[Russian Orthodox]] Church. It may also refer to the revision of history texts to glorify Stalin during his regime.

== Characters ==
The events and characters in Animal Farm are all carefully drawn to represent the history of the Soviet Union; Orwell makes this explicit in the case of Napoleon, whom he directly connects to Stalin in a letter of [[17 March]] [[1945]] to the publisher. 

:..when the windmill is blown up, I wrote 'all the animals including Napoleon flung themselves on their faces'.  I would like to alter it to 'all the animals except Napoleon'.  If that has been printed it's not worth bothering about, but I just thought the alteration would be fair to JS [Joseph Stalin], as he did stay in Moscow during the German advance.

The other characters have their analogies in the real world, but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts.

===The pigs===
*[[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] ‚Äî The pig who becomes the leader of Animal Farm post-Rebellion. Created based on the actions of [[Joseph Stalin]], he uses his military (of nine attack dogs) to cement his power through fear. Napoleon craftily drives out his opponent, Snowball.
*[[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] ‚Äî The pig who fights Napoleon for control post-Rebellion. Inspired by [[Leon Trotsky]], Snowball is a passionate intellectual and is far more honest about his motives than Napoleon. Snowball easily wins the loyalty of most of the animals. Trotsky was driven into exile in Mexico where he was assassinated.
*[[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] ‚Äî The pig who serves as public speaker. Inspired by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the Russian paper [[Pravda]], Squealer twists and abuses the language to excuse, justify and extol Napoleon's actions, no matter how egregious. All his life, George Orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language. Squealer limits the debate by complicating it, and he confuses and disorients, making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly. To squeal is to betray, something Squealer does often to his fellow animals.
*Minimus ‚Äî A poet pig who writes a song about Napoleon, representing admirers of Stalin both inside and outside the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] such as [[Maxim Gorky]].
*[[Old Major (Animal Farm)|Old Major]] ‚Äî As a fellow socialist, Orwell agreed with some of [[Karl Marx]]'s politics, and even respected [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In fact, the satire in Animal Farm is not of Marxism, or Lenin's revolution, but of the corruption that occurred later. Major, who is based upon both Lenin and Marx, is the inspiration which fuels the rest of the book. Though it is a positive image, Orwell does slip some flaws in Old Major, such as how during his complaints about the abuse of animals he admits that he has been largely free from those terrors.
*Pinkeye ‚Äî A small piglet who tastes Napoleon's food for poisoning.
*Piglets ‚Äî While not truly noted in the novel, these piglets are hinted to be the children of Napoleon, and are the first generation of animals to actually be subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.

===The humans===
*[[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] ‚Äî The original owner of Manor Farm. He is probably based on [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]].
*[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]] ‚Äî The tough owner of Pinchfield, a well-kept neighbouring farm. He is probably based on [[Germany]] and/or [[Adolf Hitler]].
*[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]] ‚Äî The easy-going but crafty owner of Foxwood, a neighbouring farm. He represents [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and/or [[Winston Churchill]].
*Mr. Whymper ‚Äî A human whom Napoleon hires to represent Animal Farm in human society. He is loosely based on [[George Bernard Shaw]] who visited the USSR in 1931 and praised what he found.

===The other animals===
*[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] ‚Äî Possibly one of the more popular characters, Boxer is the tragic avatar of the working class, or [[proletariat]]: loyal, dedicated, and strong. His major flaw, however, is his blind trust of the leaders and his inability to see corruption. He is used and abused by the pigs as much or more than he was by Jones. His death serves to show just how far the pigs are willing to go. A strong and loyal [[draft horse]], Boxer played a huge part in keeping the Farm together prior to his death. Boxer could also represent a [[Stakhanovite]]. His name is a reference to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] 
*Clover ‚Äî Boxer's close friend, and also a draft horse. She blames herself for forgetting the original [[Seven Commandments]] when Squealer revises them. She represents the middle class educated people who acquiesce to the subversion of principles by the powerful.
*Mollie ‚Äî A horse who likes wearing ribbons (which represent luxury) and being pampered by humans. She represents upper-class people, the [[Bourgeoisie]] who fled from the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R]] after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].
*Benjamin ‚Äî A [[donkey]] who is cynical about the revolution. He is said to be inspired by Orwell himself. He represented the skeptical people in and out of Russia who believed that [[communism]] would not help the people of Russia
*Moses ‚Äî A tame [[raven]] who spreads stories of Sugarcandy Mountain, the &quot;animal heaven&quot;. These beliefs are denounced by the pigs. Moses represents religion (specifically the Russian Orthodox Church), which has always been in conflict with [[communism]]. It is interesting to note that, while Moses initially leaves the farm after the rebellion, he later returns and is supported by the pigs. This represents the cynical use of religion by the state to anaesthetise the minds of the masses.  
*Muriel ‚Äî A [[goat]] who reads the edited commandments. She may represent intelligent labour.
*Jessie and Bluebell ‚Äî Two dogs who give birth in Chapter III. Their puppies are nurtured by Napoleon to inspire fear, without doubt representing the formation of the [[NKVD]]/[[KGB]].
*The Hens ‚Äî Represent the [[Kulaks]], landed [[peasants]] persecuted by [[Stalin]]. 
*The Dogs ‚Äî Napoleon's secret police and bodyguards (inspired by Cheka, NKVD, OGPU, MVD)
*The Sheep ‚Äî The sheep show the dumb, animal following of the proletariats in the midst of the Russian Civil War (‚ÄúFour legs good, two legs bad!‚Äù).

== Significance==
The book is an [[allegory]] about the events following the revolution in the [[Soviet Union]], and in particular the rise of [[Stalinism]] and the betrayal of the revolution which basically replaced one dictatorship for another. 

Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]] which are described in another of his books, ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.  He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original [[socialism|socialist]] ideals, in which he believed and continued to believe after he saw a revolution betrayed, as in Spain.  For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, Orwell describes what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/ukrainian-af-pref.htm Preface to the Ukrainian Edition of Animal Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;.

:..I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge cart-horse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.

This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book.  It was printed to be distributed among the soviet citizens of Ukraine who were just some of the many millions of [[displaced persons]] throughout Europe at the end of the Second World War.  The American occupation forces did not appreciate these illegal presses, printing propaganda, and confiscated 1,500 copies of ''Animal Farm'', handing them to the Soviet authorities.  The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that [[Ernest Bevin]] was &quot;terrified&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Letter to [[Herbert Read]], [[18 August]], [[1945]].&lt;/ref&gt; that it may cause embarrassment if published before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].

In recent years the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organization, only to become corrupt and oppressive themselves over time as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], whose succeeding African-born rulers were thought to be as corrupt as the European colonists they supplanted.

In schools Animal Farm is used in the [[Core Knowledge]] curriculum. Core knowledge is based on the interaction of different subjects in schools. The way Animal Farm comes into play is that if a student's Geography or History Class is learning about the former Soviet Union, the English class will be reading Animal Farm.

==Post-publication views of the book==
In the post-[[World War Two|War]] years it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Russian literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch ‚Äî including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. One publisher he sought to sell his book to rejected it on the grounds of government advice ‚Äî although it was later found that the civil servant who gave the order was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell: The Life'', D.J. Taylor, 2003, ISBN 0-8050-7473-2)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Orwell originally prepared a preface on freedom of the press for the book which noted &quot;The sinister fact about literary [[censorship]] in England is that it is largely voluntary. ... [Things are] kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that ‚Äòit wouldn‚Äôt do‚Äô to mention that particular fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go The Freedom of the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat [[irony|ironically]], the preface itself was censored and is not published with most copies of the book.

==Film versions==
The book was the basis of an animated feature [[film]] in 1955 (Britain's first full-length animated movie), directed by [[John Halas]] and [[Joy Batchelor]] and quietly commissioned by the American [[CIA]], which softened the theme of the story slightly by reducing the role of Moses, the character representing religion, and adding an epilogue, that occurs immediately after the novel's iconic concluding imagery is depicted, where the other animals successfully revolt against the pigs.

There was also a 1999 live action film directed by John Stephenson, with voices by [[Kelsey Grammer]] as Snowball, [[Patrick Stewart]] as Napoleon, and [[Ian Holm]] as Squealer. Despite a few differences (such as completely different songs and Jesse being the first to question the pigs), much of the plot is loyal to the book. The film diverges from the book with an additional epilogue in which Jesse and several animals escape and return years later to a post-Napoleon era Animal Farm. 

==Cultural references==
* [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[1977]] [[record album|album]] ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'' was partially inspired by Animal Farm. It categorises people as pigs, dogs, or sheep.
* In an episode of ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' (&quot;Aunt Katie's Farm&quot;), Johnny, while dressed in a pig costume, goes crazy and yells, &quot;Four legs good! Two legs bad!&quot; over and over.
* Radical socialist rappers [[Dead Prez]] released a song called &quot;Animal in Man&quot; off their debut LP, ''[[Let's Get Free]]'', re-telling the story.
* A song off canadian band [[Protest the Hero]]'s debut CD [[A Calculated Use of Sound]], called &quot;Red Stars Over the Battle of the Cowshed&quot; is presumably a reference to Animal Farm

'''Amphibians''' ([[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia''') are a [[taxon]] of [[animal]]s that include all [[tetrapod]]s (four-legged [[vertebrate]]s) that do not have [[amniotic sac|amniotic]] eggs. Amphibians (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Œ±ŒºœÜŒπœÇ'' &quot;both&quot; and ''Œ≤ŒπŒøœÇ'' &quot;life&quot;) generally spend part of their time on land, but they do not have the adaptations to an entirely terrestrial existence found in most other modern tetrapods ([[amniote]]s). There are about 5,950 described, living [[species]] of amphibians. The study of amphibians and [[reptile]]s is known as [[herpetology]]. 

== History of amphibians ==
[[Image:Salamandra salamandra CZ.JPG|thumb|226px|right|[[Fire Salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'')]]Amphibians developed with the characteristics of pharyngeal slits/[[gills]], a [[dorsal nerve cord]], a [[notochord]], and a post-anal tail at different stages of their life. They have persisted since the dawn of tetrapods 390 million years ago in the [[Devonian]] period, when they were the first four-legged animals to develop [[lung]]s. During the following [[Carboniferous]] period they also developed the ability to walk on land to avoid aquatic competition and [[predation]] while allowing them to travel from water source to water source. As a group they maintained the status of the dominant animal for nearly 75 million years. Throughout their history they have ranged in size from the 3 foot (90cm) long Devonian [[Ichthyostega]], to the slightly larger 5 foot (150cm) long [[Permian]] [[Eryops]], and down to the tiny ''[[Brachycephalus didactylus]]'' (Brazilian Gold Frog) and ''[[Eleutherodactylus iberia]]'' from [[Cuba]], with a total length of 9.6-9.8 millimeters (0.4 inches). Amphibians have mastered almost every climate on earth from the hottest deserts to the frozen arctic.

== Classification ==
[[Image:Caecilian.jpg|226px|thumb|right|[[Caecilian]] from the [[San Antonio]] zoo]]
Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all [[tetrapod]]s that are not [[amniote]]s.  Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the [[Lissamphibia]].  Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.

There are two [[ancient]], [[extinct]], [[Subclass (biology)|subclasses]]:

* Subclass [[Labyrinthodontia]] ([[paraphyletic]])
* Subclass [[Lepospondyli]]

Of the remaining modern subclass '''Lissamphibia''' there are three [[Order (biology)|order]]s:

* Order [[Anura]] ([[frog]]s and [[toad]]s) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species
* Order [[Caudata]] or [[Urodela]] ([[salamander]]s): 552 species
* Order [[Gymnophiona]] or [[Apoda]] ([[caecilian]]s): 171 species

Authorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single [[Triassic]] proto-frog species, ''[[Triadobatrachus massinoti]]''.  Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.

== Reproduction ==
For the purpose of [[reproduction]] most amphibians are bound to [[fresh water]]. A few tolerate [[brackish water]], but there are no true [[sea water]] amphibians. Several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations (e.g., [[Eleutherodactylus]], the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water whatsoever. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and [[evolution]]ary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[tropical rainforest]]s and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, bypassing the [[tadpole]] stage entirely. Several species have also adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, but most of them still need water to lay their eggs. [[Symbiosis]] with single celled [[algae]] that lives in the jelly-like layer of the eggs has evolved several times. The larvae (tadpoles or polliwogs) breathe with exterior [[gill]]s. After hatching, they start to transform gradually into the adult's appearance. This process is called [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. Typically, the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults, but there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction.

The most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land. But there are several other changes:
* The gills are replaced by other [[Respiratory system|respiratory organ]]s, i.e. [[lung]]s.
* The skin changes and develops [[gland]]s to avoid [[dehydration]]
* The eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water
* An [[eardrum]] is developed to lock the middle [[ear]]
* In frogs and toads, the [[tail]] disappears

{{main|decline in frog populations}}
[[Image:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Golden toad]] of [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]] was among the first casualties of amphibian declines. Formerly abundant, it was last seen in 1989.]]
Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted in the past two decades from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]]. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including [[habitat destruction]] and modification, over-exploitation, [[pollution]], [[introduced species]], [[climate change]], and disease.  However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and amphibian declines are currently a topic of much ongoing research.

'''Alaska''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[…ô 'l√¶ sk…ô]}}) is the 49th [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States]]. It was admitted on [[January 3]], [[1959]]. The population of the state is 626,932, [[as of 2000]], according to the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. census]]. Alaska is most likely ranked the fourth smallest state population wise in the U.S. with Wyoming, Vermont, and by now North Dakota smaller than Alaska. The name &quot;Alaska&quot; is most likely derived from the [[Aleut]] word ''Alyeska'', meaning ''greater land'' as opposed to the Aleut word ''Aleutia,'' meaning ''lesser land''. To the Aleuts, this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the ''mainland'' from an ''island''.

It is bordered by [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west, and the [[Beaufort Sea]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. Alaska is the largest state by area in the United States. It is larger in area than all but 18 of the world's nations.

==History==
{{main|History of Alaska}}

Alaska was first inhabited by humans who came across the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Eventually, Alaska became populated by the [[Inupiaq]], [[Inuit]] and [[Yupik]] [[Eskimo]]s, [[Aleut]]s, and a variety of [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] groups. Most, if not all, of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas probably took this route and continued further south and east.

The first written accounts indicate that [[Russian colonization of the Americas|the first Europeans to reach Alaska came from Russia]]. [[Vitus Bering]] sailed east and saw [[Mount Saint Elias|Mt. St. Elias]]. The [[Russian-American Company]] hunted [[sea otter]]s for their fur. The colony was never very profitable, because of the costs of transportation.

At the urging of [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], the [[United States Senate]] approved the [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from [[Russia]] for $7,200,000 (approximately $134,000,000 in 2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation[http://www.westegg.com/inflation/]) on [[9 April]] [[1867]], and the United States flag was raised on [[18 October]] of that same year (now called [[Alaska Day]]). Coincident with the ownership change, the de facto [[International Date Line]] was moved westward, and Alaska changed from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Therefore, for residents, Friday, [[October 6]], [[1867]] was followed by Friday, [[October 18]], [[1867]]; two Fridays in a row because of the date line shift.

The first American administrator of Alaska was [[Poles|Polish]] immigrant [[Wlodzimierz Krzyzanowski|W≈Çodzimierz Krzy≈ºanowski]]. The purchase was not popular in the contiguous United States, where Alaska became known as &quot;Seward's Folly&quot; or &quot;Seward's Icebox.&quot;  Alaska celebrates the purchase each year on the last Monday of [[March]], calling it [[Seward's Day]]. After the purchase of Alaska between 1867 and 1884 the name was changed to the Department of Alaska.  Between 1884 and 1912 it was called the district of Alaska.
{{lastfrontier}}
President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the [[Alaska Statehood Act]] into [[United States law]] on [[7 July]] [[1958]] which paved the way for Alaska's admission into the Union on [[January 3]] [[1959]].

Alaska suffered one of the worst [[earthquake]]s in recorded North American history on [[Good Friday]] 1964 (see [[Good Friday Earthquake]]).

In 1976, the people of Alaska amended the state's constitution, establishing the [[Alaska Permanent Fund]]. The fund invests a portion of the state's mineral revenue, including revenue from the [[Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System]], &quot;to benefit all generations of Alaskans.&quot; In March 2005, the fund's value was over $30 billion.

Prior to 1983, the state lay across four different [[time zone]]s&amp;mdash;Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8 hours) in the southeast panhandle, a small area of Yukon Standard Time (UTC -9 hours) around [[Yakutat]], Alaska&amp;ndash;Hawaii Standard Time (UTC -10 hours) in the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] vicinity, with the [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] area and most of the [[Aleutian Islands]] observing Bering Standard Time (UTC -11 hours).  In 1983 the number of time zones was reduced to two, with the entire mainland plus the inner Aleutian Islands going to UTC -9 hours (and this zone then being renamed Alaska Standard Time as the [[Yukon Territory]] had several years earlier (circa 1975) adopted a single time zone identical to Pacific Standard Time), and the remaining Aleutian Islands were slotted into the UTC &amp;minus;10 hours zone, which was then renamed Hawaii&amp;ndash;Aleutian Standard Time.

Over the years various [[vessel]]s have been named [[USS Alaska|USS ''Alaska'']], in honor of the state.

During [[World War II]] three of the outer Aleutian Islands&amp;mdash;[[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska]]&amp;mdash;were occupied by [[Japan|Japanese]] troops. It was the only territory within the current borders of the United States to have land occupied during the war.

==Politics==
Alaska is often characterized as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state with strong [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] tendencies. Local political communities often work on issues related to land use development, [[fishing]], [[tourism]], and [[individual rights]] as many residents are proud of their rough Alaskan heritage.

[[Alaska Native|Alaska Natives]], while organized in and around their communities, are often active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]] which have been given ownership over large tracts of land, and thus need to deliberate resource conservation and development issues.

In presidential elections, the state's Electoral College votes have been most often won by a Republican nominee. Only once has Alaska supported a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, when it supported [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the landslide year of 1964, although the 1960 and 1968 elections were close. No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. President [[George W. Bush]] won the state's electoral votes in 2004 by a margin of 25 percentage points with 61.1% of the vote.  Juneau stands out as an area that supports Democratic candidates.

When the [[United States Congress]], in 1957 and 1958, debated the wisdom of admitting it as the 49th state, much of the political debate centered on whether Alaska would become a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state. Conventional wisdom had it that, with its rugged individualism, penchant for new ideas, and dependence on the [[Federal Government]] largess for basic needs, it would become a Democratic stronghold, about which Republicans, and the, then, Republican Administration of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] had reservations. Given time, those fears proved roundly unfounded. After an early flirtatious period with liberal politics, the political climate of Alaska changed quickly once [[petroleum]] was discovered and the federal government came to be seen as 'meddling' in local affairs. Still, despite its libertarian leanings, the state regularly takes in more federal money than it gives out, a fact that can be attributed at least partially to its equal representation in the [[United States Senate]].     

In recent years, the [[Alaska Legislature]] is a 20-member Senate serving 4-year terms and 40-member House serving 2-year terms. It has been dominated by conservatives, generally Republicans. Likewise, recent state governors have been mostly conservatives, although not always elected under the official 'Party' banner. Republican [[Walter Joseph Hickel|Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after jumping the Republican ship and briefly joining the [[Alaskan Independence Party]] ticket just long enough to be reelected. He subsequently officially 'rejoined' the Republican fold in 1994. 

Alaska's members of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] are all Republican. U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]] was appointed to the position following the death of U.S. Senator [[Bob Bartlett]] in December of 1968, and has never lost a re-election campaign since. As the longest-serving Republican in the Senate (some political wits call him Senator-For-Life), Stevens has been a crucial force in gaining Federal money for his state.

Until his resignation from the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to run for Governor, Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other Senatorial position and, as Governor, was allowed to appoint his daughter, [[Lisa Murkowski]] as his successor. She won a full six-year term on her own in 2004.

Alaska's sole [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. House]] Representative, [[Don Young]] won re-election to his 17th-straight term, also in 2004. His seniority in House ranks him as one of the most influential Republican House members. His position on the House Transportation Committee allowed him to parlay some $450 million to two bridge projects in Alaska, named the ''[[Bridges to Nowhere]]'', for which he gained national notoriety following the devastation in the State of [[Louisiana]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and his insistence that the money not be returned to aid in rebuilding the Gulf Coast.

==Geography==
[[image:Looking back to Little Port Walter - NOAA.jpg|thumb|250px|Near [[Little Port Walter]]]]
Alaska is one of the two states that is not bordered by another US state, [[Hawaii]] being the other. It is the only state that is both in [[North America]] and is not part of the 48 contiguous states; about 500 miles (800 kilometers) of [[Canada|Canadian]] territory separate Alaska from Washington. Therefore, Alaska is an [[exclave]] of the United States that is part of the continental U.S. but is not part of the contiguous U.S. It is also the only mainland state whose [[capital city]] is accessible only via [[Water transportation|ship]] or [[aviation|air]]. There are no [[road]]s connecting Juneau to the rest of the state.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area, 570,374 square miles (1&amp;nbsp;477&amp;nbsp;261 km¬≤). If a map of Alaska were superimposed upon a map of the [[Continental United States]], Alaska would overlap [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]]. Alaska has the longest [[coastline]] of any state.

One scheme for describing the state's geography is by labeling the regions:
*[[South Central Alaska]] is the southern coastal region and is the population center for the state. The Municipality of Anchorage and many small but growing towns, such as [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]], and [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]], lie within this area. [[Petroleum]] industrial plants, transportation, [[tourism]], and two [[military base]]s form the core of the economy here.
*The [[Alaska Panhandle]], also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to Juneau, many small towns, tidewater [[glacier|glaciers]] and extensive forests. Tourism, fishing, forestry and state government anchor the economy.
*The [[Alaska Interior]] is home to [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. The geography is marked by large [[braided river]]s, such as the [[Yukon River]] and the [[Kuskokwim River]], as well as [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] lands and shorelines.
*The [[Alaskan Bush]] is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and, most famously, [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], the northernmost town in the United States.

The northeast corner of Alaska is covered by the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], which covers 19,049,236 acres (79,318 km¬≤).

With its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (54&amp;nbsp;700 km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] is called the [[Aleutian Islands]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians. For example, [[Unimak Island]] is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], a moderately active volcano that rises to 9,980 ft (3042&amp;nbsp;m) above [[sea level]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland.

North America's second largest [[tide]]s occur in [[Turnagain Arm]] just south of Anchorage, which often sees tidal differences of more than 35 feet (10.7&amp;nbsp;m).

Alaska is home to 3.5 million [[lake]]s of 20 acres (8&amp;nbsp;ha) or larger. [[Marshland]]s and wetland [[permafrost]] cover 188,320 square miles (487&amp;nbsp;747&amp;nbsp;km¬≤, mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands. Frozen water, in the form of [[glacier]] ice, covers  some 16,000 square miles (41&amp;nbsp;440&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) of land and 1200 square miles (3108&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) of tidal zone. The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with [[Yukon]], [[Canada]], covers 2250 square miles (5827&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) alone.

{{ussm|alaska.png|ak}}
The Aleutian Islands actually cross longitude 180¬∞, also making it the easternmost state, although the [[International Date Line]] doglegs around them to keep the whole state in the same day. It is part of the [[extreme points of the United States]].

According to the October 1998 report of the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[United States Federal Government|U.S. Federal Government]] as [[national forest]]s, [[national park]]s, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s. Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages 87 million acres (350&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km¬≤), or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]].

Of the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.

==Boroughs and census areas==
Alaska has no [[county (United States)|counties]] in the sense used in the rest of the country. Instead, the state is divided into [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|27 census areas and boroughs]]. The difference between [[borough]]s and census areas is that boroughs have an organized area-wide government, while census areas are artificial divisions defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]] for statistical purposes only. Areas of the state not in organized boroughs compose what the government of Alaska calls the [[unorganized borough]]. Borough-level government services in the unorganized borough are provided by the state itself.

==Economy==
[[Image:wiki_alaska.jpg|thumb|350px|Greetings from Alaska]]
The state's 2003 total gross state product was $31 billion. Its ''per-capita'' income for 2003 was $33,213, 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation. Alaska's main export is seafood. Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaska economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere. Employment is primarily in government and industries such as [[natural resource]] extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and [[tourism]] sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. This has changed for the most part in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], where the cost of living is actually less than some major cities in the Lower 48, thanks to lower housing and transportation costs. The introduction of big-box stores in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices. However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods, compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure. Many rural residents come in to these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]]. Some have embraced the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.

==Transportation==
[[image:Alaska Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|234px|Bridge on [[Alaska Highway]] between [[Watson Lake]] and [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]].]]
Alaska is arguably the least-connected state in terms of road transportation. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through [[Canada]]. The state capital, [[Juneau]], is not accessible by road, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system. One unique feature of the road system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], which links the [[Seward Highway]] south of Anchorage with the relatively isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]]. The tunnel held the title of the longest road tunnel in North America (at nearly 2.5 miles [4&amp;nbsp;km]) until completion of the 3.5 mile (5.6km) [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; project in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The Anderson Tunnel combines a one-lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing. Consequently, eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the [[Alaska Railroad]] must share the tunnel, resulting in waits of 20 minutes or more to enter.  As reflected on the Alaska Department of Transportation [http://www.dot.state.ak.us/creg/whittiertunnel/index.shtml Tunnel Website], it is now considered &quot;North America's longest railroad-highway tunnel.&quot;

The [[Alaska Railroad]] runs from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] through [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Denali]], and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] to [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]]. The railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving Alaska's natural resources, such as coal and gravel, to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward. The Alaska Railroad is the only remaining railroad in North America to use [[caboose]]s on its freight trains. A stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area.

Most cities and villages in the state are accessible only by sea or air. Alaska has a well-developed [[ferry]] system, known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]], which serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|Southeast]] and the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington]] up the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. Cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air, accounting for Alaska's extremely well-developed [[Alaskan Bush|Bush]] air services&amp;mdash;an Alaskan novelty.

Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are serviced by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (unofficial sources have estimated the numbers for 2004 at some four million tourists arriving in Alaska between May and September).

However, regular flights to most villages and towns within the state are commercially challenging to provide. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-200s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines like: [[Era Aviation]], [[Peninsula Airways|PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered Bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities. But perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the Bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and lots of items from stores and warehouse clubs.

Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times, dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod]], a 1,150-mile (1850&amp;nbsp;km) trail from Anchorage to Nome. The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash prizes and prestige.

As of 2005, Alaska has an estimated population of 663,661, which is an increase of 5,906, or 0.9%, from the prior year and an increase of 36,730, or 5.9%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 36,590 people derived from its 53,132 births of which 16,542 deaths is subtracted from, and an increase due to net migration of 1,181 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 5,800 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 4,619 people.

Alaska is the least densely populated state.

===Race and ancestry===
The racial breakdown of the state is:
*67.6% [[Whites|White]] (Non-Hispanic)
*15.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[Alaska Native]]
*4.1% [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]]
*4% [[Asian American|Asian]]
*3.5% [[Blacks|Black]]
*5.4% [[Mixed race]]

The largest ancestry groups in the state are: [[German-American|German]] (16.6%), Alaska Native or American Indian (15.6%), [[Ireland|Irish]] (10.8%), [[British American|English]] (9.6%), [[United States|American]] (5.7%), and [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian]] (4.2%). Alaska has the largest percentage of American Indians (16%) of any state.

The vast, sparsely populated bush regions of northern and western Alaska are primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives, and they also have a large presence in the southeast. Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other parts of south-central and southeast Alaska have many whites of northern and western European ancestry. The Wrangell-Petersburg area has many residents of Scandinavian ancestry and the Aleutians have many Filipinos. Most of the state's black population lives in Anchorage.

[[As of 2000]], 85.7% of Alaska residents age 5 and older speak [[English language|English]] at home and 5.2% speak [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers make up 2.9% of the population, followed by [[Tagalog]] speakers at 1.5% and [[Korean language|Korean]] at 0.8%.

===Religion===
*[[Christianity|Christian]] &amp;ndash; 81%
**[[Protestantism|Protestant]] &amp;ndash; 68%
***[[Baptist]] &amp;ndash; 11%
***[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] &amp;ndash; 8%
***[[Methodism|Methodist]] &amp;ndash; 6%
***[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] &amp;ndash; 2%
***[[Episcopal]] &amp;ndash; 1%
***[[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] &amp;ndash; 1%
**[[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] &amp;ndash; 8%
**[[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Catholic]] &amp;ndash; 7%
**[[Latter-day Saint]] &amp;ndash; 1%
*Other [[religion]]s &amp;ndash; 1%
*Not religious/[[agnosticism|agnostic]] &amp;ndash; 17%

Notable is Alaska's relatively large [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity|Christian]] population, a result of early [[Russia]]n colonization and [[missionary]] work among indigenous Alaskans.

==Social issues==
Alaska has long had a problem with alcohol use and abuse. Many rural communities in Alaska have outlawed its import. &quot;Dry&quot;, &quot;wet&quot;, and &quot;damp&quot; are terms describing a community's laws on liquor consumption. This problem directly relates to Alaska's high rate of [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]] (FAS) as well as contributing to the high rate of suicides. This is a controversial topic for many residents.

Alaska has also had a problem with &quot;[[brain drain]]&quot; as many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state upon graduating high school. While for many this functions as a sort of [[walkabout]], many do not return to the state. The [[University of Alaska]] has been successfully combating this by offering four-year scholarships to the top 10 percent of Alaska high school graduates, the Alaska Scholars Program.

[[Domestic abuse]] and other violent crimes are also at notoriously high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.

==Notable Alaskans==
The [[National Statuary Hall]] of the United States of America is part of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Each state has selected one or two distinguished citizens and provided statues. Alaska's are of its first two senators:
* [[Bob Bartlett|Edward Lewis &quot;Bob&quot; Bartlett]] (1904&amp;ndash;1968) was the territorial delegate to the US Congress from 1944 to 1958, and was elected as the first senior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] in 1958 and re-elected in 1964. There are streets, buildings, and even the first state ferry, named for him.
* [[Ernest Gruening]] (1886&amp;ndash;1974) was appointed Governor of the [[Alaska Territory|Territory of Alaska]] in 1939, and served in that position for fourteen years. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1958 and re-elected in 1962.
* [[Jay Hammond]] (1922&amp;ndash;2005) was Governor during the building of the [[Alaska Pipeline]] and established the [[Alaska Permanent Fund]], providing Alaskans with essentially free money. He is regarded as somewhat of a hero because of this. He was also governor during passage of the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] and effectively served to moderate associated issues within the state among disparate interest groups ranging from conservationists to natives to pro-development interests.
* [[Fran Ulmer]] was the first woman elected to statewide office&amp;mdash;she became Lieutenant Governor in 1994.
* [[George Sharrock]] (1910&amp;ndash;2005) moved to the territory before statehood, eventually elected as the mayor of Anchorage and served during the [[Good Friday Earthquake]] in March 1964. This was the most devastating earthquake to hit Alaska and it sunk beach property, damaged roads and destroyed buildings all over the south central area. Sharrock, sometimes called the &quot;earthquake mayor,&quot; led the city's rebuilding effort over six months.

==Important cities and towns==
Alaska's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home of 260,283 people, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. It ranks third in the [[List of U.S. cities by area]], behind two other Alaskan cities. Sitka ranks as America's largest city by area, followed closely by Juneau.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] of creating an actual, implied or apparent plan of any complex [[object]] or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the apparent architecture of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[Computer software|software]], [[computers]], [[enterprise]]s, and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the 'user' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or [[components]] of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements/components.

'''Architecture''' may refer to:

* [[Architecture|Architecture (built environment)]], the art and science of designing habitations, buildings, and building complexes; classical architecture.
*  [[Architectural history]] studies the evolution and history of (built) architectures across the world through a consideration of various influences- [[artistic]], [[cultural]], [[political]], [[economic]], and [[technological]].
* [[Architecture (other)]], a representation of an arbitrary abstract, natural, or man-made structure of two or more interacting parts (e.g., architecture of mathematics, architecture of language, cytoarchitecture, cellular architecture, naval architecture, skelletal architecture, battlefield architecture).  All [[systems]] can be said to have an architecture.
* [[Biological architectures]], the ''apparent'' architecture of biological structures. See [[cytoarchitecture]], [[structural biology]], [[cell (biology)|cell architecture]]
* [[Landscape architecture]], the design of man-made land constructs
* [[Systems architecture]], the representation of an engineered (or To Be Engineered) system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the design(s) for such a system. Such a system may consist of information and/or hardware and/or software.
* [[Computer architecture]], the systems architecture of a computer.
* [[Software architecture]], the systems architecture of a software system. 
* [[Enterprise architecture]], a systems architecture, or framework,  for aligning an organization's structure/ processes/ information/ operations/  projects with the organization's overall strategy 
* [[Information architecture]], a systems architecture for structuring a knowledge-based system
* [[Product design]], or product architecture, the systems design of a product or product family
* [[Vehicle architecture]], an automobile platform made from a set of components common to a number of different vehicles

'''Agriculture''' is the process of producing [[food]], [[feed]], [[fiber]] and many other desired products by the cultivation of certain [[plant]]s and the raising of domesticated [[animal]]s ([[livestock]]). The practice of agriculture is also known as &quot;[[farming]]&quot;, while scientists, inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture.

More [[Person|people]] in the [[world]] are involved in agriculture as their primary [[economics|economic activity]] than in any other, yet it only accounts for four percent of the world's [[gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;!--Source?--&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Agriculture---Rice.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Tea]] plantation in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]

Agriculture sometimes refers to  [[subsistence farming|subsistence agriculture]], the production of enough [[food]] to meet just the needs of the farmer/[[agriculturalist]] and his/her family. It may also refer to industrial agriculture, (often referred to as [[factory farming]]) long prevalent in developed nations and increasingly so elsewhere, which consists of obtaining financial income from the cultivation of land to yield [[produce]], the commercial raising of animals ([[animal husbandry]]), or both.

Agriculture is also short for the ''study'' of the practice of agriculture&amp;mdash;more formally known as [[agricultural science]]. Agricultural students are known (sometimes derisively) as &quot;Aggies&quot;.

Increasingly, in addition to food for humans and [[fodder|animal feeds]], agriculture produces goods such as cut [[flower]]s, ornamental and [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] plants, [[timber]] or lumber, [[fertilizer]]s, [[animal hides]], [[leather]], industrial chemicals ([[starch]], [[sugar]], [[ethanol]], [[alcohol]]s and [[plastic]]s), [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), fuels ([[methane]] from [[biomass]], [[biodiesel]]) and both legal and illegal drugs ([[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[tobacco]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]], [[cocaine]]). [[GMO|Genetically engineered]] plants and animals produce specialty drugs.

In the [[Western world]], the use of [[genetic modification|gene manipulation]], better management of soil nutrients, and improved [[weed control]] have greatly increased yields per unit area. At the same time, the use of mechanization has decreased labour requirements. The developing world generally produces lower yields, having less of the latest science, [[capital (economics)|capital]], and technology base.

Modern agriculture depends heavily on engineering and technology and on the biological and physical sciences. [[Irrigation]], [[drainage]], [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and sanitary engineering, each of which is important in successful farming, are some of the fields requiring the specialized knowledge of agricultural engineers.

Agricultural chemistry deals with other vital farming concerns, such as the application of fertilizer, insecticides (see [[Pest control]]), and fungicides, soil makeup, analysis of agricultural products, and nutritional needs of farm animals.[[Plant breeding]] and genetics contribute additionally to farm productivity. Advanced seed engineering has allowed strains of seed to become perfect in every farming situation. Seeds can now germinate faster and adapt to shorter growing seasons in different climates. Present-day seed can resist the spraying of pesticides that kill all green-leaf plants. [[Hydroponics]], a method of soilless gardening in which plants are grown in chemical nutrient solutions, may help meet the need for greater food production as the world's population increases.

The packing, processing, and marketing of agricultural products are closely related activities also influenced by science. Methods of quick-freezing and dehydration have increased the markets for farm products (see [[Food preservation]]; [[Meat packing industry]]).

Mechanization, the outstanding characteristic of late [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century]] agricultural evolution, has eased much of the backbreaking toil of the farmer. More significantly, mechanization has enormously increased farm efficiency and productivity (see [[Agricultural machinery]]). Animals, including horses, mules, oxen, camels, llamas, alpacas, and dogs; however, are still used to cultivate [[field (agriculture)|fields]], harvest [[crops]] and transport farm products to markets in many parts of the world.

Airplanes, helicopters, trucks and tractors are used in agriculture for seeding, spraying operations for insect and disease control, [[Aerial topdressing]], transporting perishable products, and fighting forest fires. Radio and television disseminate vital weather reports and other information such as market reports that concern farmers. Computers have become an essential tool for farm management.

[[Image:Farming-on-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Farming, ploughing rice paddy, in [[Indonesia]].]]

According to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the US, agricultural mechanization is one of the 20 greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. Early in the century, it took one American farmer to produce food for 2.5 people, where today, due to engineering technology (also, [[plant breeding]] and [[agrichemical]]s), a single farmer can feed over 130 people [http://www.greatachievements.org/greatachievements/ga_7_2.html]. This comes at a cost, however, of large amounts of energy input, from unsustainable, mostly [[fossil fuel]], sources.

Animal husbandry means breeding and raising animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis.

In recent years some aspects of industrial [[intensive agriculture]] have been the subject of increasing discussion. The widening [[sphere of influence]] held by large seed and chemical companies, meat packers and food processors has been a source of concern both within the farming community and for the general public. There has been increased activity of some people against some farming practices, raising chickens for food being one example. Another issue is the type of feed given to some animals that can cause [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy]] in cattle. There has also been concern because of the disastrous effect that intensive agriculture has on the environment. In the US, for example, fertilizer has been running off into the Mississippi for years and has caused a dead spot in the Gulf of Mexico, where the Mississippi empties. Intensive agriculture also depletes the fertility of the land over time and the end effect is that which happened in the Middle East, were some of the most fertile farmland in the world was turned into a desert by intensive agriculture.

The patent protection given to companies that develop new types of [[seed]] using [[genetic engineering]] has allowed seed to be licensed to farmers in much the same way that computer software is licensed to users. This has changed the balance of power in favor of the seed companies, allowing them to dictate terms and conditions previously unheard of. Some argue these companies are guilty of [[biopiracy]].

[[Soil]] [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[nutrient management]] have been important concerns since the [[1950s]], with the best farmers taking a [[stewardship]] role with the land they operate. However, increasing contamination of waterways and wetlands by nutrients like [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are of concern in many countries.

Increasing consumer awareness of agricultural issues has led to the rise of  [[community-supported agriculture]], [[local food movement]], [[Slow Food|slow food]], and commercial [[organic farming]], though these yet remain fledgling industries.

==History==
[[Image:Ancient egyptian farmer.gif|thumb|230px|Ancient Egyptian farmer]]

: ''Main article: [[History of agriculture]]''

[[Paleoethnobotany|Archaeobotanists]]/[[Paleoethnobotany|Paleoethnobotanists]] have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics, such as a semi-tough [[rachis]] and larger [[seeds]], to just after the [[Younger Dryas]] (about 9,500 BC) in the early [[Holocene]] in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Limited [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence both indicate a [[cereal|grain]]-[[grinding]] [[culture]] [[farming]] along the [[Nile]] in the [[10th millennium BC]] using the world's earliest known type of [[sickle]] [[blade]]s. There is even earlier evidence for conscious cultivation and seasonal harvest: grains of [[rye]] with domestic traits have been recovered from [[Epi-Palaeolithic]] (10,000+ BC) contexts at [[Abu Hureyra]] in [[Syria]], but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye, rather than a definitive step towards domestication. It is not until ca. 8,500 BC, in middle-Eastern cultures referred to as [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]]), where there is the first definite evidence for the emergence of a widespread subsistence economy that was dependent on domesticated plants and animals. In these contexts lie the origins of the eight so-called [[Neolithic founder crops|founder crops]] of agriculture: firstly [[emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], then hulled [[barley]], [[pea]], [[lentil]], [[bitter vetch]], [[chick pea]] and [[flax]]. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] sites in this region, although the consensus is that [[wheat]] was the first to be sown and harvested on a significant scale. There are many sites that date to between ca. 8,500 BC and 7,500 BC where the systematic farming of these crops contributed the major part of the inhabitants' diet. From the [[Fertile Crescent]] agriculture spread eastwards to [[Central Asia]] and westwards into [[Cyprus]], [[Anatolia]] and, by 7,000 BC, [[Greece]]. Farming, principally of emmer and einkorn, reached northwestern [[Europe]] via southeastern and central Europe by ca. 4,800 BC (see, among others, Price, D. [ed.] 2000. ''Europe's First Farmers''. Cambridge University Press; Harris, D. [ed.] 1996 ''The Origins and Spread of Agriculture in Eurasia''. UCL Press).
[[Image:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A [[tractor]] [[plough]]ing an [[alfalfa]] field]]

The reasons for the earliest introduction of farming may have included [[climate]] change, but possibly there were also social reasons (e.g. accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift-giving). Most certainly there was a gradual transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild. Although localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the [[Levant]], the fact that farming was 'invented' at least three times, possibly more, suggests that social reasons may have been instrumental. In addition to emergence of farming in the [[Fertile Crescent]], agriculture appeared by at least 6,800 BC in East Asia ([[rice]]) and, later, in [[Mesoamerica|Central]] and [[South America]] ([[maize]], [[squash (fruit)|squash]]). Small scale agriculture also likely arose independently in early Neolithic contexts in [[India]] (rice) and [[Southeast Asia]] (taro).&lt;!--Sources?--&gt;

[[Image:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Sumer]]ian Harvester's sickle, [[3000 BCE]]. Baked clay. [[Field Museum]].]]

Full dependency on domestic crops and animals (i.e. when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet) was not until the [[Bronze Age]]. If the operative definition of ''agriculture'' includes large scale intensive cultivation of land, [[mono-cropping]], organised [[irrigation]], and use of a specialized [[labour (economics)|labour]] force, the title &quot;inventors of agriculture&quot; would fall to the [[Sumer]]ians, starting ca. 5,500 BC. Intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies. The agriculturalism of the Sumerians allowed them to embark on an unprecedented territorial expansion, making them the first [[empire]] builders. Not long after, the Egyptians, powered by effective farming of the [[Nile|Nile valley]], achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the Sumerian empire in area.&lt;!--Sources?--&gt;

The invention of a [[three field system]] of crop rotation during the [[Middle Ages]] vastly improved agricultural efficiency.

After [[1492]] the world's agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;!--Is this just Crosby's term or is it more widely used?--&gt; Crops and animals that were previously only known in the Old World were now transplanted to the New and vice versa. Perhaps most notably, the [[tomato]] became a favorite in European cuisine, while certain wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native North, Central and South Americans.

By the early [[1800]]s agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before, especially in the largely virgin lands of North and South America. With the rapid rise of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]] in the 20th century, especially in the form of the [[tractor]], the demanding tasks of [[sowing]], [[harvesting]] and [[threshing]] could be performed with a speed and on a scale barely imaginable before. These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, Argentina, Israel, Germany and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit.

===Crop improvement===
[[Image:Cropscientist.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An agricultural scientist records corn growth]]
[[Image:Bird netting.jpg|thumb|250px|Netting protecting wine grapes from birds]]
*''See main article on'' [[Plant breeding]]

Domestication of plants is done in order to increase yield, improve disease resistance and drought tolerance, ease harvest and to improve the taste and [[nutrition]]al value and many other characteristics. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant breeders use greenhouses and other techniques to get as many as three generations of plants per year so that they can make improvements all the more quickly.

Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and '30s improved [[pasture]] (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive radiation mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the [[1950s]] produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn and barley.&lt;!--Source?--&gt;

For example, average yields of corn ([[maize]]) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (40 bushels per acre) in [[1900]] to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in [[2001]], primarily due to improvements in genetics. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in [[1900]] to more than 2.5 t/ha in [[1990]]. [[South America]]n average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, [[Africa]]n under 1 t/ha, [[Egypt]] and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as [[France]] is over 8 t/ha. Higher yields are due to improvements in genetics, as well as use of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical [[pest control]], growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;!--Sources?--&gt; [Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat = 60 pounds (lb) ‚âà 27.215 kg. 1 bushel of corn = 56 pounds ‚âà 25.401 kg]

In industrialized agriculture, crop &quot;improvement&quot; has often reduced nutritional and other qualities of food plants to serve the interests of producers.  After mechanical tomato-harvesters were developed in the early 1960s, agricultural scientists bred tomatoes that were harder and less nutritious (Friedland and Barton 1975).  In fact, a major longitudinal study of nutrient levels in numerous vegetables showed significant declines in the last 50 years; garden vegetables in the U.S. today contain on average 38 percent less vitamin B2 and 15 percent less vitamin C (Davis and Riordan 2004).

Very recently, [[genetic engineering]] has begun to be employed in some parts of the world to speed up the selection and breeding process. The most widely used modification is a herbicide resistance gene that allows plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate, which is used to control weeds in the crop. A less frequently used but more controversial modification causes the plant to produce a toxin to reduce damage from insects (c.f. [[Transgenic maize|Starlink]]).

There are specialty producers who raise less common types of livestock or plants.

[[Aquaculture]], the farming of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]], is closely associated with agriculture.

[[Beekeeping|Apiculture]], the culture of bees, traditionally for [[honey]]&amp;mdash;increasingly for crop [[pollination]].

==Environmental problems==
Agriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful by-products. Some of the negative effects are:

* [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] surplus in [[river]]s and [[lake]]s.
* Detrimental effects of [[herbicide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, and other [[biocide]]s.
* Conversion of natural [[ecosystem]]s of all types into [[arable land]].
* Consolidation of diverse [[biomass]] into a few species.
* [[Erosion]]
* Depletion of [[minerals]] in the [[soil]]
* [[Particulate matter]], including [[ammonia]] and [[ammonium]] off-gasing from animal waste contributing to [[air pollution]]
* [[Weed]]s - [[feral]] plants and animals
* Odor from agricultural [[waste]]
* [[Soil salination]] .

==Policy==
[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:
*[[Foodborne illness|Food safety]]: Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination.
*[[Food security]]: Ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs.
*[[Food quality]]: Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality.

* Conservation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' ([[July 26]], [[1894]] &amp;ndash; [[November 22]], [[1963]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[writer]] who emigrated to the [[United States]]. He was a member of the famous [[Huxley family]] who produced a number of brilliant scientific minds. Best known for his [[novel]]s and wide-ranging output of [[essay]]s, he also published [[short stories]], [[poetry]], [[travel writing]], and [[film]] stories and scripts. Through his novels and essays Huxley functioned as an examiner and sometimes critic of social mores, societal norms and ideals, and possible misapplications of science in [[human]] [[life]]. While his earlier concerns might be called &quot;[[humanist]],&quot; ultimately, he became quite interested in &quot;spiritual&quot; subjects like [[parapsychology]] and [[mysticism|mystically]] based [[philosophy]], which he also wrote about. By the end of his life, Huxley was considered, in certain circles, a 'leader of modern thought'.

==Biography==
 
===Early years===
[[Image:Huxley-Arnold family tree.png|thumb|right|Family tree]]
Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], [[England]]. He was the son of the [[writer]] [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] by his first wife, [[Julia Arnold]]; and grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], one of the most important naturalists of the 19th Century, a man known as &quot;Darwin's Bulldog.&quot; His brother [[Julian Huxley]] was a [[biology|biologist]] also noted for his [[evolution|evolutionary]] theories. Huxley understandably excelled in the areas he took up professionally, for on his father's side were a number of noted men of [[science]], while on his mother's were people of [[literature|literary]] accomplishment. 

Huxley was a lanky, delicately framed child who was gifted intellectually. His father was a professional [[herbalist]] as well as an author, so Aldous began his learning in his father's well-equipped [[botanical]] [[laboratory]], then continued in a school named Hillside, which his mother supervised for several years until she became terminally ill. From the age of nine, Aldous was then educated in the British [[boarding school]] system. He took readily to the handling of ideas. 

His mother Julia died in [[1908]], when Aldous was only fourteen, and his sister Roberta died of an unrelated incident in the same month. Three years later Aldous suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which seriously damaged his eyesight. His older brother Trev committed [[suicide]] in 1914. Aldous's near-[[blindness]] disqualified him from service in [[World War I]]. Once his eyesight recovered, he was able to read [[English literature]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]].

Maturing as a lean young man well over six feet in height, the cerebrotonic Huxley's initial interest in literature was primarily intellectual. While he was noted for his personal kindliness, only considerably later (some say under the influence of such friends as [[D.H. Lawrence]]) did he heartily embrace ''feelings'' as matters of importance in his evolving personal philosophy and literary expression.

Following his education at [[Balliol]], Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. For a short while in [[1918]], he was employed acquiring provisions at the [[Air Ministry]]. But never desiring a career in administration (or in business), Huxley's lack of inherited means propelled him into applied literary work.

Huxley had completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of seventeen and began writing seriously in his early twenties. He wrote great novels on dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes (e.g. ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''). Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

===Middle years===
Already a noted [[satire|satirist]] and social thinker, during [[World War I]], Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]], home of Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]]. Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' ([[1921]]) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. He married Maria Nys, whom he had met at Garsington. They had one child, Matthew, who grew up to be an [[epidemiologist]].

Huxley moved to [[Hollywood, California| Hollywood]], [[California]] in [[1937]] with his wife and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] and [[meditation|meditating]]. In Huxley's 1937 book ''Ends and Means'', most people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of 'liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love', though they haven't been able to agree on how to achieve it. His book goes on to explore why the confusion or disagreement is there and what might be done about it.

In [[1938]] Huxley befriended [[J. Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a [[Vedantist]] in the circle of [[Swami]] [[Swami Prabhavananda | Prabhavananda]], and he also introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''The Perennial Philosophy'', which discussed teachings of the world's great mystics.

For most of his life since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, his eyesight was poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). Around 1939 he heard of the [[Bates Method]] for [[Natural Vision Improvement]], and of a teacher (Margaret Corbett) who was able to teach him in the method. He claimed his sight improved dramatically as a result of using the method, then later wrote a book about it (The Art of Seeing) which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without [[glasses|spectacles]] and without strain. He was a [[screenwriter]] for the [[1940]] production of [[Pride and Prejudice]].

===Later years===
After World War II Huxley applied for [[United States]] citizenship, but was denied because he would not say he would take up arms to defend America. He became a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Thereafter, his works were strongly influenced by [[mysticism]] and his experiences with the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]] [[mescaline]], to which he was introduced by the psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]] in [[1953]]. His years on psychoactive drugs were described as a paradise, washed down with [[bourbon]], generally. He was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use in a search for enlightenment, famously taking 100 micrograms of [[LSD]] as he lay dying. Huxley's [[psychedelic]] [[Recreational drug use|drug]] experiences are described in the essays ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (the title deriving from some lines in the book ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[William Blake]]) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]''. The title of the former became the inspiration for the naming of the [[Rock (music)|rock]] band, [[The Doors]]. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early [[hippies]].

Huxley's main interest was not in just ''anything'' vague, mysterious, or subjective, but in what is sometimes termed &quot;higher mysticism&quot;; he liked the term &quot;[[perennial philosophy]]&quot; that he used as the title of his noted book on the topic. During the 1950s, Huxley's interest in the related field of [[psychical research]] grew keener.

Huxley's wife, Maria, died of [[breast cancer]] in [[1955]], and in [[1956]] he remarried, to [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]], who was herself an author and who wrote a [[biography]] of Aldous. In [[1960]], Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer|throat cancer]]. In the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the utopian novel ''[[Island (novel)|Island]]'', and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; at the [[Esalen]] institute. In [[1959]] Huxley, who remained a [[British Citizen]], turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold_MacMillan#Government|Macmillan government]].

His ideas were foundational to the forming of the [[Human Potential Movement]]. He was also invited to speak at several prestigious American universities. At a speech given in [[1961]] at the California Medical School in [[San Francisco]], Huxley warned: &quot;There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless [[concentration camp]] for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it,&quot; an idea not dissimilar to his contemporary writer [[J. B. Priestley]]'s idea in [[The Magicians]].

Huxley's views on the proper roles of science and technology (as he portrayed these, say, in ''Island'') are akin to some other noted English and American thinkers of the twentieth century, such as [[Lewis Mumford]] and Huxley's friend [[Gerald Heard]] (and, in some ways, [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]]). Clearly, these men found descendants in some significant movers of a younger generation, e.g., [[Stewart Brand]].

Via Gerald Heard, Huxley was introduced to the young [[Huston Smith]], who went on to become a prolific and famous scholar on the religions of man. The two friends acquianted Smith with Vedanta and meditative practice. Later, while Huxley was a guest professor at [[M.I.T.]], he made introductions between Smith and [[Timothy Leary]] that lead to epiphanies Smith covers in his later book, ''Cleansing of the Doors of Perception''.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591810086]&lt;/sup&gt;

Amongst humanists, Huxley was considered an intellectual's intellectual. Although his financial circumstances had forced him to churn out articles and books, his thinking and ''best'' writing earned him an exalted esteem. His books were frequently on the required reading lists of English and modern philosophy courses in American colleges and universities. He was one of the twentieth-century thinkers honoured in the Scribners Publishing's &quot;Leaders of Modern Thought&quot; series (a volume of biography and literary criticism by Philip Thody, ''Aldous Huxley'').

===Death and afterwards===
On his deathbed, unable to speak, he made a written request to his wife for &quot;[[LSD]], 100 [[microgram|¬µg]], [[Intramuscular injection|i.m.]]&quot; She obliged, and he died peacefully the following morning, [[November 22]], [[1963]]. Media coverage of his death was overshadowed by news of the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], which occurred on the same day, as did the death of the [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[C. S. Lewis]].

In all of Huxley's mature writings, one finds an awareness that seems to bridge the gap between &quot;[[The Two Cultures]]&quot; &amp;ndash; the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. This gulf posed a potentially enormous problem, one that was recognized by other thinkers during Huxley's lifetime, such as [[C.P. Snow]]. The interest among professors of humanities and [[liberal arts]] in Huxley's work, both during the writer's lifetime and afterwards, rests on this consciousness on the part of the author, and of course on the artful and often humorous way in which he expressed himself.

Huxley's [[satirical]], [[dystopia]]n, and [[utopia]]n novels seldom fail to stimulate thought. The same may be said for his essays and essay collections. Perhaps his main message is the tragedy that frequently follows from [[egocentrism]], self-centredness, and selfishness.

==Films==

Huxley wrote many [[screenplay]]s, and many of his novels were later adapted for film or [[television]]. 

Notable works include the original screenplay for [[The_Walt_Disney_Company|Disney]]'s animated ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', two productions of ''[[Brave New World]]'', one of ''[[Point Counter Point]]'', one of ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]'', and one of ''[[Ape and Essence]]''. He was one of the screenwriters for the 1940 version of ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 movie)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' and co-wrote the screenplay for the 1944 version of ''[[Jane Eyre (1944 movie)|Jane Eyre]]'' with [[John Houseman]].  Director [[Ken Russell]]'s [[1971]] film ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]], is adapted from Huxley's ''[[The Devils of Loudun]]'', and a 1990 made-for-television film adaptation of ''Brave New World'' was directed by [[Burt Brinckeroffer]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about an organism. See [[algae programming language]] for a [[programming language]] in [[computing]].''
[[Image:Laurencia.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A seaweed (''Laurencia'') up close: the &quot;branches&quot; are multicellular and only about 1 mm thick. Much smaller algae are seen growing attached to the structure extending upwards in the lower right quarter]]
'''Algae''' (singular ''alga'') encompass several different groups of living organisms that capture light energy through [[photosynthesis]], converting inorganic substances into simple sugars using the captured energy.  Algae have been traditionally regarded as simple [[plant]]s, and some are closely related to the [[embryophyte|higher plant]]s.  Others appear to represent different [[protist]] groups, alongside other organisms that are traditionally considered more animal-like (that is, [[protozoa]]).  Thus algae do not represent a single evolutionary direction or line, but a level of organization that may have developed several times in the early history of life on earth.

Algae range from single-celled organisms to multi-cellular organisms, some with fairly complex differentiated form and (if marine) called [[seaweed]]s. All lack [[leaf|leaves]], [[root]]s, [[flower]]s, and other organ structures that characterize higher plants.  They are distinguished from other [[protozoa]] in that they are [[autotrophic|photoautotrophic]], although this is not a hard and fast distinction as some groups contain members that are [[mixotrophic]], deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have reduced or lost their photosynthetic apparatus.

All algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the [[cyanobacteria]], and so produce [[oxygen]] as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike non-cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria.

Algae are usually found in damp places or bodies of water and thus are common in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments.  However, terrestrial algae are usually rather inconspicuous and far more common in moist, tropical regions than dry ones, because algae lack vascular tissues and other adaptions to live on land. Algae can endure dryness and other conditions in symbiosis with a fungus as [[lichen]]. 

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology.  Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column&amp;mdash;called '''[[phytoplankton]]'''&amp;mdash;provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities (so-called [[algal bloom]]s) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete or poison other life forms.  [[Seaweed]]s grow mostly in shallow marine waters. Some are used as human food or harvested for useful substances such as [[agar]] or fertilizer.  The study of algae is called [[phycology]] or algology.

== Relationships among algal groups ==
=== Prokaryotic algae ===
Traditionally the [[cyanobacteria]] have been included among the algae, referred to as the ''cyanophytes'' or ''Blue-green Algae'', (the term &quot;algae&quot; refers to any aquatic organisms capable of photosynthesis)[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanolh.html], though some recent treatises on algae specifically exclude them.  [[Cyanobacteria]] are some of the oldest organisms to appear in the [[fossil record]], dating back about 3.8 billion years ([[Precambrian]]). Ancient cyanobacteria likely produced much of the [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere.  

[[Cyanobacteria]] can be unicellular, colonial, or filamentous. They have a [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cell structure typical of bacteria and conduct photosynthesis directly within the [[cytoplasm]], rather than in specialized organelles. Some filamentous [[blue-green algae]] have specialized cells, termed heterocysts, in which [[nitrogen fixation]] occurs.
[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e42/42a.htm]

=== Eukaryotic algae ===
All other algae are [[eukaryote]]s and conduct photosynthesis within membrane-bound structures (organelles) called [[chloroplast]]s.  Chloroplasts contain DNA and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbionts]].  The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among the different lines of algae, reflecting different endosymbiotic events.  There are three groups ([[Archaeplastida]]) that have ''primary'' chloroplasts:

* [[Green alga]]e, together with [[embryophyte|higher plant]]s
* [[Red alga]]e
* [[Glaucophyte]]s

In these groups, the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiosis.  The chloroplasts of red algae have a more or less typical cyanobacterial pigmentation, while those of the green alga have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'', the latter found in some cyanobacteria and not most.  Higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them.

Two other groups of algae have green chloroplasts containing chlorophyll ''b'': 

* [[Euglenid]]s and 
* [[Chlorarachniophyte]]s.  

These are surrounded by three and four membranes, respectively, and were probably retained from an ingested green alga.  Those of the chlorarchniophytes contain a small nucleomorph, which is the remnant of the alga's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  It has been suggested that the euglenid chloroplasts only have three membranes because they were acquired through [[myzocytosis]] rather than [[phagocytosis]].

The remaining algae all have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c''.  The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with the red algae suggest a relationship there.  These groups include:

* [[Heterokont]]s (e.g., golden algae, diatoms, brown algae)
* [[Haptophyte]]s (e.g., coccolithophores)
* [[Cryptomonad]]s
* [[Dinoflagellate]]s

In the first three of these groups ([[Chromista]]), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor.  The typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes, but there is considerable diversity in chloroplasts among the group, as some members have acquired theirs from different sources.  The [[Apicomplexa]], a group of closely related parasites, also have [[plastid]]s though not actual chloroplasts, which appear to have a common origin with those of the dinoflagellates.

Note many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic.  Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost them entirely.

== Forms of algae ==
Most of the simpler algae are unicellular [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups.  Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, are:

* ''Colonial'' - small, regular groups of motile cells
* ''Capsoid'' - individual non-motile cells embedded in [[mucilage]]
* ''Coccoid'' - individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* ''Palmelloid'' - non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* ''Filamentous'' - a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* ''Parenchymatous'' - cells forming a [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] with partial differentiation of tissues

In three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached, leading to organisms with full tissue differentiation.  These are the [[brown alga]]e&amp;mdash;some of which may reach 70 m in length ([[kelp]]s)&amp;mdash;the [[red alga]]e, and the [[green alga]]e. The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see [[Charales]]), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants.  The point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other alga groups.

== Algae and symbioses==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the alga. Examples include:
* ''lichens'' - a fungus is the host, usually with a green alga or a cyanobacterium as its symbiont. Both fungal and algal species found in lichens are capable of living independently, although habitat requirements may be greatly different from those of the lichen pair. 
* ''corals'' - algae known as [[zooxanthella]]e are symbionts with [[coral]]s. Notable amongst these is the dinoflagellate ''Symbiodinium'', found in many hard corals. The loss of ''Symbiodinium'', or other zooxanthellae, from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]].
* ''sponges'' -

== Uses of algae ==
Algae are used by man in a great many ways. Because many species are aquatic and microscopic, they are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. [[Algae culture]] on a large scale is an important type of [[aquaculture]] in some places.  

===Energy source===
*Algae can be used to produce [[biodiesel]] (see [[algae culture#biodiesel production|algae culture]]), and by some estimates can produce vastly superior amounts of oil, compared to terrestrial crops grown for the same purpose.  Because algae grown to produce biodiesel does not need to meet the requirements of a food crop, it is much cheaper to produce.  Also it does not need fresh water or fertilizer (both of which are quite expensive).
*Algae can be grown to produce [[hydrogen]].  In 1939 a German researcher named [[Hans Gaffron]], while working at the University of Chicago, observed that the algae he was studying, [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]] (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.[http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html]  Gaffron never discovered the cause for this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts at its discovery.  In the late 1990's professor [[Anastasios Melis]] a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley discovered that if you deprive the algae of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen.  He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase will not cause this switch in the pressence of oxygen.  Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen. [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5]  [[Chlamydomonas moeweesi]] is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.
*Algae can be grown to produce [[biomass]], which can be burned to produce heat and electricity.

===Pollution control===
* Algae are used in wastewater treatment facilities, reducing the need for more dangerous chemicals. 
* Algae can be used to capture [[fertilizers]] in runoff from farms.  If this algae is then harvested, it itself can be used as fertilizer.
* Algae are used by some powerplants to reduce CO2 [[emissions]][http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-01-10-algae-powerplants_x.htm]. The CO2 is pumped into a pond, or some kind of tank, on which the algae feed.

===Nutritional value of algae===
*Algae is commercially cultivated as a nutritional supplement. One of the most popular [[microalgal]] species is [[Spirulina]] (Arthrospira platensis), which is a [[Cyanobacteria]] (known as blue-green algae), and has been hailed by some as a superfood. [http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm]Other algal species cultivated for their nutritional value include; [[Chlorella]] (a green algae), and [[Dunaliella]] (Dunaliella salina), which is high in [[beta-carotene]] and is used in vitamin C supplements.
*Algae is sometimes also used as a food, as in the Chinese &quot;vegetable&quot; known as ''[[fat choy (vegetable)|fat choy]]'' (which is actually a [[cyanobacterium]]).
*The oil from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids.  [[Arachidonic acid]](a polyunsaturated fatty acid), is very high in [[parietochloris incisa]], (a green algae) where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool (Bigogno C et al. Phytochemistry 2002, 60, 497).

The natural [[pigment]]s produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical [[dyes]] and coloring agents.  [http://www.bgu.ac.il/bgn/Microalgae.html]  Many of the paper products used today are not recyclable because of the chemical inks that they use, paper recyclers have found that inks made from algae are much easier to break down.  There is also much interest in the food industry into replacing the coloring agents that are currently used with coloring derived from algal pigments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[statistics]], '''analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s and their associated procedures which compare means by splitting the overall observed [[variance]] into different parts.  The initial techniques of the analysis of variance were pioneered by the [[statistician]] and [[geneticist]] [[Ronald Fisher]] in the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], and is sometimes known as '''Fisher's ANOVA''' or '''Fisher's analysis of variance'''.

==Overview==

There are three conceptual classes of such models:
*Fixed-effects model assumes that the data come from [[normal distribution|normal populations]] which differ in their means.
*Random-effects models assume that the data describe a hierarchy of different populations whose differences are constrained by the hierarchy.
*Mixed models describe situations where both fixed and random effects are present.

The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares into components related to the effects in the model used. For example, we show the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels. (If the treatment levels are quantitative and the effects are linear, a [[linear regression]] analysis may be appropriate.)

: &lt;math&gt;SS_{\hbox{Total}} = SS_{\hbox{Error}} + SS_{\hbox{Treatments}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The number of [[degrees of freedom]] (abbreviated ''df'') can be partitioned in a similar way and specifies the [[chi-square distribution]] which describes the associated sums of squares.

: &lt;math&gt;df_{\hbox{Total}} = df_{\hbox{Error}} + df_{\hbox{Treatments}}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Fixed-effects model ==

The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter has subjected his experimental material to several treatments, each of which affects only the mean of the underlying normal distribution of the &quot;response variable&quot;.

== Random-effects model ==

Random effects models are used to describe situations in which incomparable differences in experimental material occur. The simplest example is that of estimating the unknown mean of a population whose individuals differ from each other. In this case, the variation between individuals is ''confounded'' with that of the observing instrument.

== Degrees of freedom ==

Degrees of freedom indicates the effective number of observations which contribute to the sum of squares in an ANOVA, the total number of observations minus the number of linear constraints in the data.

== Tests of significance ==

Analyses of variance lead to tests of [[statistical significance]] using [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]]'s [[F-distribution]].

:''For [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]s containing one or more rings, see [[Cycloalkane]].''

An '''alkane''' in [[organic chemistry]] is a [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]] without cycles, that is, an acyclic [[hydrocarbon]] in which the [[molecule]] has the maximum possible number of [[hydrogen]] atoms and so has no [[double bond]]s. Alkanes are [[aliphatic]] compounds.

The general formula for alkanes is '''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;'''; the simplest possible alkane is therefore [[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The next simplest is [[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;; the series continues indefinitely.  Each carbon atom in an alkane has sp¬≥ [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridization]].

Alkanes are also known as [[Paraffin|paraffins]], or collectively as the ''paraffin series''. These terms also used for alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single, unbranched chain. Such branched-chain alkanes are called ''[[isoparaffins]]''.

==Isomerism==
The atoms in alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in multiple ways, forming different [[isomer]]s. &quot;Normal&quot; alkanes have a linear, unbranched configuration. The number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms; for  alkanes with 1 to 12 carbon atoms, the number of isomers equals 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 18, 35, 75, 159, and 355, respectively {{OEIS|id=A000602}}.

==Nomenclature of alkanes==
The names of all alkanes end with '''-ane'''.

===Alkanes with unbranched carbon chains===
The first four members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
:[[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:[[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
:[[propane]], C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
:[[butane]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
Alkanes with [[five]] or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] with elision of a terminal ''-a-'' from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; [[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;; [[heptane]], C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;; [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;; etc. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].

Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ''n-'' (for ''normal'') to distinguish them from branched-chain alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers: e.g. [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] is a [[neurotoxin]] while its branched-chain isomers are not.

===Alkanes with branched carbon chains===
Branched alkanes are named as follows:

* Identify the longest straight chain of carbon atoms.

* Number the atoms in this chain, starting from 1 at one end and counting upwards to the other end.

* Examine the groups attached to the chain in order and form their names.

* Form the name by looking at the different attached groups, and writing, for each group, the following:
** The number, or numbers, of the carbon atom, or atoms, where it is attached.
** The prefixes ''di-'', ''tri-'', ''tetra-'', etc. if the group is attached in 2, 3, 4, etc. places, or nothing if it is attached in only one place.
** The name of the attached group.

* The formation of the name is finished by writing down the name of the longest straight chain.

To carry out this algorithm, we must know how to name the substituent groups.  This is done by the same method, except that instead of the longest chain of carbon atoms, the longest chain starting from the attachment point is used; also, the numbering is done so that the carbon atom next to the attachment point has the number 1.

For example, the compound
[[image:isobutane.png]]
is the only 4-carbon alkane possible, apart from butane.  Its formal name is 2-methylpropane.

Pentane, however, has two branched isomers, in addition to its linear, normal form:

[[image:dimethylpropane.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
2,2-dimethylpropane

and

[[image:2-methylbutane.png]] &lt;br /&gt;
2-methylbutane.

===Trivial names===
The following nonsystematic names are retained in the IUPAC system:
:[[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane
:[[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane
:[[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane
The name ''isooctane'' is very widely used in the [[Petrochemistry|petrochemical industry]] to refer to [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]].

==Occurrence==
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|Methane and ethane make up a large proportion of Jupiter's atmosphere]]
Alkanes occur both on [[Earth]] and in the solar system, however only the first hundred or so, and even then mostly only in traces. The light hydrocarbons, especially [[methane]] and [[ethane]] for example, have been detected both in the tail of the comet [[Hyakutake]] and in some [[meteorite]]s such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s. They also form an important portion of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of the outer gas planets [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. On [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the satellite of Saturn, it is believed that there were once large oceans of these and longer chain alkanes: smaller seas of liquid ethane are thought still to exist there.

Traces of methane (about 0.0001% or 1 ppm) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by forms of [[Archaea]]. The content in the oceans is negligible due to the low solubility in water: however, at high pressures and low temperatures, methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane hydrate]]. Although they cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the calorific value of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together&amp;mdash;methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore a candidate for future fuels.

[[Image:Oil well3419.jpg|thumb|right|Extraction of alkanes in Ontario]]
Today, the most important commercial sources for alkanes are clearly [[natural gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]], which are the only [[organic compound]]s to occur as minerals in nature. Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some [[propane]] and [[butane]]: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons. Both were formed when dead marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment (ie lacking in oxygen) and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These hydrocarbons collected in porous rocks, trapped beneath an impermeable cap rock. In contrast to methane, which is constantly reformed in large quantities, higher alkanes rarely develop to a considerable extent in nature. The present deposits will not be reformed once they are exhausted.

Solid alkanes occur as [[evaporation]] residues from oil, known as [[tar]]. One of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in the [[asphalt]] lake known as the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

==Purification and use==
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:ShellMartinez.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez]], [[California]].]]
Alkanes are both important raw materials of the chemical industry and the most important fuels of the world economy.

The starting materials for the processing are always [[natural gas]] and [[crude oil]]. The latter is separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products, for example [[gasoline]]. The different &quot;fractions&quot; of crude oil have different boiling points and can be isolated and separated quite easily: within the individual fractions the boiling points lie closely together.

The domain of usage of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of  carbon atoms, although the following demarcation is idealized and not perfect. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main componants of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is however easier to transport them as liquids: this requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

[[Propane]] and [[butane]] can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as '''liquified petroleum gas (LPG)'''. Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner, butane in disposable cigarette lighters (where the pressure is a mere 2 [[bar (unit)|bar]]). The two alkanes are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.

From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the unifomity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred, as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]] than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100 and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are charaterised by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In latter function they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used for example in road surfacing. However the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[cracking]].

==Preparation==
Numerous ways exist to prepare alkanes in the laboratory. The most well known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s and [[hydrolysis]] of [[Grignard reagent]]s. Alkanes can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction]]. The [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols and the [[Clemmensen reduction]] removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes.

==Molecular geometry==
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ch4-hybridisation.png|thumb|right|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridisation in [[methane]].]]
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always [[Orbital hybidisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridised]], that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s-orbital and the three 2p-orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron, the angle of 109.47¬∞ between them.

===Bond lengths and bond angles===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
An alkane molecule has only C&amp;ndash;H and C&amp;ndash;C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of a sp¬≥-orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp¬≥-orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09√ó10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C&amp;ndash;H bond and 1.54√ó10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C&amp;ndash;C bond.
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp¬≥-orbitals&amp;mdash;they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47¬∞ between them. Structural formulae which represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

===Conformation===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degree of freedom]] for each carbon&amp;ndash;carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformation]].

====Ethane====
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C&amp;ndash;C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C&amp;ndash;C bond, then one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]: The circle represents the two carbon atoms, one behind the other, and the bonds to hydrogen are represented by the straight lines. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120¬∞ between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0¬∞ and 360¬∞. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon&amp;ndash;carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important:
[[Image:Newman_projection_ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]

* In the '''eclipsed conformation''', corresponding to a torsion angle of 0¬∞, 120¬∞ or 240¬∞, the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are directly in front of those attached to the rear carbon.
* In the '''staggered conformation''', corresponding to a torsion angle of 60¬∞, 180¬∞ or 300¬∞, the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are exactly in between those attached to the rear carbon.

The two conformations, also known as [[rotomer]]s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation. The explanation for this difference in energy has been the subject of debate, with two main theories predominating:
*in the eclipsed conformation, the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen bonds is maximised.
*in the staggered conformation, the [[hyperconjugation]] (a form of delocalisation) of the valence electrons is maximised.
These two explanations are not contradictory or exclusive; the latter is thought to be the more important for ethane itself.

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C&amp;ndash;C bond, albeit with short &quot;pauses&quot; at each staggered conformation. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group by 120¬∞ relative to the other, is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds.

====Higher alkanes====
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Newman_projection_butane.png|thumb|right|400px|The four conformations of butane. From left to right: fully eclipsed, inclined, partially eclipsed, antiperiplanar.]]
The situation with respect to the two C&amp;ndash;C bonds in [[propane]] is qualitatively similar to that of ethane: it is more complex, however, for [[butane]] and higher alkanes.

If one takes the central C&amp;ndash;C bond of butane as the reference axis, each of the two central carbon atoms is bound to two hydrogen atoms and a methyl group. Four different conformations can be defined by the torsion angle between the two methyl groups and, as in the case of ethane, each has its characteristic energy.

*The '''fully eclipsed''' or '''synperiplanar''' conformation has a torsion angle of 0¬∞. It is the configuration with the highest energy.

*The '''inclined''' conformation has a torsion angle of 60¬∞ (or 300¬∞). It is a local energy minimum.

*The '''partially eclipsed''' conformation has a torsion angle of 120¬∞ (or 240¬∞). It is a local energy maximum.

*The '''antiperiplanar''' conformation has a torsion angle of 180¬∞. The two methyl groups are as far from each other as is possible, and this configuration has the lowest energy.

The difference in energy between the fully eclipsed conformation and the antiperiplanar conformation is about 19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, and is therefore still relatively small at ambient temperature.

The case of higher alkanes is similar: the antiperiplanar conformation is always the most favoured around each carbon&amp;ndash;carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealised forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

The conformations of other organic molecules are based on those of alkanes, and are discussed in the relevant articles.

===Physical properties===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Alkanschmelzundsiedepunkt.png|right|thumb|300px|Melting (blue) and boiling (pink) points of the first 14 ''n''-alkanes in ¬∞C. ]]
The molecular structure, particularly the [[surface area]] of the molecule, determines the boiling point of the alkane: the smaller the surface, the lower the boiling point, as the [[van der Waals force]]s between the molecules are weaker. A reduction of the surface area can be achieved by chain-branching or by a circular structure. This means in practice that alkanes with higher number of carbon atoms usually have higher [[boiling point]]s than those with lower numbers of carbon atoms, and that branched-chain alkanes and [[cycloalkane]]s have lower boiling points than their straight-chain homologues. Under [[standard conditions]], from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes are gaseous; from C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; they are liquids; and after C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; they are solids. The boiling point increases between 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-group.

The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes also rise with the increase in the number of carbon atoms (with only one exception, [[propane]]). However the melting points rise more slowly than the boiling points, in particular for the higher alkanes. In addition, the melting points of alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms increase faster than the melting points of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms (see figure): the cause of this phenomenon is the higher [[packing density]] of the alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms. The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, depending on the efficiency of molecular packing: this is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of their normal analogues.

Alkanes do not conduct [[electricity]], nor are they substantially [[Polarization|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistance of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimised by minimising the contact between alkane and water: alkanes are said to be [[hydrophobic]] in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property which is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.

===Chemical properties===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Alkanes generally show a relatively low reactivity, because their C&amp;ndash;H and C&amp;ndash;C bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily broken. Unlike all other organic compounds, they possess no [[functional group]]s.

They react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances. The [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] values of all alkanes are above 60, and so they are practically inert to acids and bases. This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' ([[Latin]] ''para'' + ''affinis'', with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However [[redox reaction]]s of alkanes, in particular with [[oxygen]] and the [[halogen]]s, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of [[methane]], the lowest possible [[oxidation state]] for carbon (&amp;minus;4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen leads to [[combustion]]; with halogens, [[substitution]].  In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes.

Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as [[cracking]] and [[reformation]] where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly brached alkanes, the [[bond angle]]s may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5&amp;deg;) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hinderance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.

===Thermochemistry===
Alkanes are stable molecules relative to their constituent elements, which is manifested as a negative [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|heat of formation]]. For linear alkanes, each [[methylene]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) unit contributes -5 kcal/mol to the overal heat of formation. Branched alkanes are always a little bit more stable than their linear isomers; for example, 2-methylbutane is more stable than ''n''-pentane by 1.8 kcal/mol, and 2,2-methylpropane is more stable than ''n''-pentane by 5 kcal/mol.

See the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.

===Spectroscopic properties===
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon&amp;ndash;carbon and carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characreistic spectroscopic features.
====Infrared spectroscopy====
The carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the carbon&amp;ndash;carbon stretching mode absorbes between 800 and 1300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1375&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
====NMR spectroscopy====
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&amp;ndash;1. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 8&amp;ndash;30 (methyl), 15&amp;ndash;55 (methylene), 20&amp;ndash;60 (methyne). The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser enhancement]] and the long [[relaxation time]]: it can be missed in routine spectra.

====Mass spectrometry====
Alkanes have a high [[ionisation energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M&amp;minus;15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-groups.

==Reactions==
===Reactions with oxygen===
All alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasing difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:2C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + (3''n''+1)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2(''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2''n''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below for [[methane]]:
:2CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2CO + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; C + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Alkanes usually burn with a non-luminous flame with very little soot formation.

The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], &amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for alkanes increases by about 650&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of &amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

===Reactions with halogens===
Alkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called [[halogenation]] reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced, or [[Substitution|substituted]], by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species which participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.

The chain mechanism is as follows, using the chlorination of methane as a typical example:
:'''1.''' ''Initiation'': splitting of a chlorine molecule to form two chlorine atoms, initiated by [[ultraviolet radiation]]. A chlorine atom has an unpaired electron and acts as a free radical.
::Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2Cl&amp;middot;
:'''2.''' ''Propagation'' (two steps): a hydrogen atom is pulled off from methane then the methyl radical pulls a Cl&amp;middot; from Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
::CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + HCl
::CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + Cl&amp;middot;
:This results in the desired product plus another chlorine radical. This radical will then go on to take part in another propagation reaction causing a chain reaction. If there is sufficient chlorine, other products such as CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be formed.
:'''3.''' ''Termination'': recombination of two free radicals:
::Cl&amp;middot; + Cl&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; or
::CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + Cl&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl; or
::CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
:The last possibility in the termination step will result in an impurity in the final mixture; notably this results in an organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants.

In the case of methane or ethane, all the hydrogen atoms are equivalent and have an equal chance of being replaced. This leads to what is known as a ''statistical product distribution''. For propane and higher alkanes, the hydrogen atoms which form part of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or CH) groups are preferentially replaced.

The reactivity of the different halogens varies considerably: the relative rates are: [[fluorine]] (108) &gt; [[chlorine]] (1) &gt; [[bromine]] (7&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; [[iodine]] (2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;22&lt;/sup&gt;). Hence the reaction of alkanes with fluorine is difficult to control, that with chlorine is moderate to fast, that with bromine is slow and requires high levels of UV irradiation while the reaction with iodine is practically non-existent and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] unfavorable.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons.

===Cracking and reforming===
&quot;[[Cracking]]&quot; breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermic or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism, that is, bonds break symmetrically and thus pairs of [[free radical]]s are formed. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst|catalysts]] (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite|zeolites]]) which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of [[ion|ions]] of opposite charges, usually a carbo[[cation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[intramolecular|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride transfer]]. In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a
self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

Here is an example of cracking with butane CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

* 1st possibility (48%): breaking is done on the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond.

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;* / *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkane and an [[alkene]]:
CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

* 2nd possibility (38%): breaking is done on the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond.

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* / *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkane and an [[alkene]]
from different types: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

* 3rd possibility (14%): breaking of a C-H bond

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an [[alkene]] and hydrogen gas: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Other reactions===
&lt;!-- translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Alkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can by [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]],  [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chloride]]s.

==Hazards==
Methane is explosive in when mixed with air (1&amp;ndash;8% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and is a strong [[greenhouse gas]]: other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane, heptane and octane are classed as ''dangerous for the environment'' and ''harmful''. The straight chain isomer of hexane is a [[neurotoxin]], and therefore rarely used commercially.

==Alkanes in nature==
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Although alkanes occur in nature in various way, they do not rank biologically among the essential materials. Cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in [[musk]], extracted from [[deer]] of the family [[Moschidae]]. All further information refers to acyclic alkanes.

===Bacteria and archaea===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in the Earth's atmosphere.]]
Certain types of [[bacteria]] can metabolise alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.

On the other hand certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantites of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidised]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year&amp;mdash;the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release up to 150&amp;nbsp;litres per day, and of [[termite]]s, is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of [[human]]s. Methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of [[natural gas]] were formed in a similar way.

===Fungi and plants===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Fuji apple.jpg|thumb|right|Water forms droplets on a thin film of alkane wax on the skin of the apple.]]
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Some specialised yeasts, e.g. ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.

In plants it is the solid long-chain alkanes that are found; they form a firm layer of wax, the [[cuticle]], over areas of the plant exposed to the air. This protects the plant against water loss, while preventing the [[leaching]] of important minerals by the rain. It is also a protection against bacteria, fungi and harmful [[insect]]s&amp;mdash;the latter sink with their legs into the soft waxlike substance and have difficulty moving. The shining layer on fruits such as apples consists of long-chain alkanes. The carbon chains are usually between twenty and thirty carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants from [[fatty acid]]s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent, but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.

===Animals===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. On example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% [[pristane]] (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;). Their occurrence is more important in [[pheromone]]s, chemical messenger materials, on which above all insects are dependent for communication. With some kinds, as the support beetle ''[[Xylotrechus colonus]]'', primarily [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;), 3-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;), they are transferred by body contact. With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contians the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;), and
acts by smell over longer distances, a useful characteristic for [[pest control]].

===Ecological relations===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''Ophrys sphegodes'')]]
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[heptacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odour. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower  not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempte to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavour is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

An '''appeal''' is the act or fact of challenging a judicially cognizable and binding [[judgment]] to a higher judicial authority. In [[common law]] jurisdictions, most commonly, this means formally filing a [[notice of appeal]] with a lower court, indicating one's intention to take the matter to the next higher court with jurisdiction over the matter, and then actually filing the appeal with the appropriate [[Court of Appeals|appellate court]]. 

==United States==
The [[United States]] legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial ''de novo'' or an appeal on the record.

A [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by [[administrative agency|administrative agency]], referees, masters, commissioners and some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial ''de novo'' by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both [[appellant]] and [[respondent]] are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the [[jury]] on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.

In cases where a [[judge]] rather than a [[jury]] decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an ''abuse of discretion'' standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it was a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some rare cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case ''and'' that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

An appellate court is a [[court]] that hears cases in which a [[lower court]] -- either a [[trial court]] or a lower-level appellate court &amp;#8212; has already made a decision, but in which at least one party to the action wants to challenge this ruling based upon some legal grounds that are allowed to be appealed either by right or by leave of the appellate court.  These grounds typically include errors of [[law]], [[fact]], or [[due process]].

In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

==Who can appeal==
A party who files an appeal is called an ''appellant'', and a party on the other side is an ''appellee'' or ''respondent'' or, in some jurisdictions, the party who files is known as a ''petitioner'' and the party being sued is designated the ''respondent''.  Cross-appeals can also occur, when more than one party to a case is unhappy with the decision in some way, often when the winning party claims that more damages were deserved than were awarded.

An appeal ''as of right'' is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal ''by leave'' or ''permission'' requires the appellant to move for leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision.

In [[tort]], [[equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal ''as of right''.  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal ''as of right'' from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law ''by leave'' from the trial court and/or the appellate court.

==How an appeal is processed==
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the [[law]] that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).  

If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it.  It may in addition send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.  

In some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision ''de novo'' (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.  

Another situation is where appeal is by way of ''re-hearing''. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court. An example would be an appeal from a [[Magistrate's court]] to the [[Crown Court]] in [[England and Wales]].

Sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)  In [[England]] and many other jurisdictions, however, the phrase ''appeal dismissed'' is equivalent to the [[United States|U.S.]] term ''affirmed''; and the phrase ''appeal allowed'' is equivalent to the U.S. term ''reversed''.

Generally there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the [[record]] of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed &amp;#8212; unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in ''very'' rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].

In some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate [[lawyer]]s, if represented, or ''[[pro se]]'' if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

It is important to note that in an [[adversarial system]] appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against [[legal precedent]] that judgment will stand even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

In the [[United States]], a [[lawyer]] traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;

{{CivilProcedure}}

An '''answer''' (derived from ''and'', against, and the same root as ''swear'') was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to some one or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defence, a reply to a question or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.  In the [[common law]], an '''answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]]. 

The ''answer'' establishes which allegations ([[cause of action]] in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant's [[Defense (legal)|defense]]s, thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the [[court]].

In the case of a criminal case there is usually an [[arraignment]] or some other kind of appearance before the court by the defendant.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is either [[guilt|guilty]] or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or an [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentum'' (&quot;answers of the learned&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman lawyers, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.

In music an &quot;'''answer'''&quot; is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{CrimPro}}
'''Arraignment''' is a [[common law]] term for the formal reading of a [[crime|criminal]] [[complaint]], in the presence of the [[defendant]], to inform him of the charges against him. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar), which set out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. In addition, [[United States|US]] jurisdictions allow pleas of &quot;[[nolo contendere]]&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;[[Alford plea]]&quot; in some circumstances. 

In the [[UK]] arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. The defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each individual charge. 

==Guilty and Not Guilty pleas==
If the defendant pleads guilty an [[preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During that hearing the judge will assess the offense, [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character; and then pass [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. If the defendant pleads [[not guilty]], a date will be set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or [[Jury trial|trial]].

==What if the defendant enters no plea?==
In the past, a defendant who refused to plea (or, &quot;stood mute&quot;) would be subjected to [[Crushing|peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for &quot;strong and hard punishment&quot;). But today in all common law jurisdictions, defendants who refuse to enter a plea will have a plea of not guilty entered for them on their behalf.

==The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure==
The US ''[[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]'' state: &quot;...arraignment shall...[consist of an] open...reading [of] the [[indictment]]...to the defendant...and calling on him to plead thereto. He shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he is called upon to plead.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''America the Beautiful'''&quot; is an [[United States|American]] [[patriotic song]] which rivals &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, the [[national anthem]] of the United States, in popularity.  It is often found in [[Christian]] [[hymn]]als in a wide variety of churches in the United States, and may be sung as part of a Christian service of worship to [[The Trinity|God]].

==History==

The words are by [[Katharine Lee Bates]], an English teacher at [[Wellesley College]]. She had taken a train trip to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]] in [[1893]] to teach a short summer school session at [[Colorado College]], and several of the sights on her trip found their way into her poem:
*The [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the &quot;White City&quot; with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings.
*The wheat fields of [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on [[July 4]].
*The majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from atop [[Pike's Peak]].
On that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later in ''[[The Congregationalist]]'', to commemorate the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]]. It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.

Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. The [[hymn]] ''Materna'', composed in [[1882]] by [[Samuel A. Ward]], was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Ward had been similarly inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]] after a leisurely summer day, and he immediately wrote it down. Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain. Miss Bates was more fortunate, as the song's popularity was well-established by her death in 1929.

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Some prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; over &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. (Others prefer &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the same reason.) While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.

Popularity of the song soared following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem.

[[Ray Charles]] is credited with the song's most well known rendition in current times (although [[Elvis Presley]] had a good success with it in the 70¬¥s). His recording is very commonly played at major sporting events, such as the [[Super Bowl]]. His unique take on it places the third verse first, after which he sings the usual first verse. In the third verse (see below), the author scolds the [[materialistic]] and self-serving [[robber baron]]s of her day, and urges America to live up to its noble ideals and to honor, with both word and deed, the memory of those who died for their country...a message that resonates just as strongly today.&lt;!-- Agreed.  Also see the entire set of 1913 lyrics (source listed below) where this antimaterialist, God-centered theme is repeated in one of the forgotten to most American's ears &quot;extra&quot; lyrics.  --&gt;

An amusing oddity of the song is that its meter (technically &quot;[[Common metre|common meter double]]&quot; or 8-6-8-6-8-6-8-6) is identical to that of ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]''. The two songs can be sung perfectly with lyrics interchanged.

==Lyrics==
Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,&lt;br /&gt;
For amber waves of grain,&lt;br /&gt;
For purple mountain majesties&lt;br /&gt;
Above the fruited plain!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  God shed his grace on thee,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Oh beautiful, for pilgrims' feet&lt;br /&gt;
Whose stern, impassioned stress&lt;br /&gt;
A thoroughfare for freedom beat&lt;br /&gt;
Across the wilderness!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  God mend thine ev'ry flaw;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law!''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Oh beautiful, for heroes proved&lt;br /&gt;
In liberating strife,&lt;br /&gt;
Who more than self their country loved&lt;br /&gt;
And mercy more than life!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  May God thy gold refine,''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Til all success be nobleness, and ev'ry gain divine!''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Oh beautiful, for patriot's dream&lt;br /&gt;
That sees beyond the years!&lt;br /&gt;
Thine alabaster cities gleam&lt;br /&gt;
Undimmed by human tears!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  God shed his grace on thee,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea!''

==Takeoffs==
A song as popular and familiar as &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; inevitably gets used out of its proper context or time frame, for humorous effect. As the song seems to have &quot;always been there&quot;, it is often presented as if [[Christopher Columbus]] had written it when he arrived at the [[New World]] (though in fact, Columbus never set foot on [[North America]]; all his voyages were to the [[Caribbean|Caribbean islands]], [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]]). Some examples:

*In 1971, the song inspired the cross-country [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]] race from New York to Los Angeles that later was the topic of several movies with [[Burt Reynolds]]

*A ''[[Far Side]]'' cartoon from 1982 (reprinted in Sherr's book) shows Columbus nearing land, with his crew of ''conquistador'' types, and saying, &quot;Look, gentlemen! Purple mountains! Spacious skies! Fruited plains! ... Is someone writing this down?&quot;

*In one of his comedy club routines in the early [[1960s]], [[Flip Wilson]] did a Columbus story with an African-American twist... ironically, the catchphrase repeated by Queen Isabel (an early &quot;Geraldine&quot;) is &quot;Chris gon' find Ray Charles!&quot;  When his Columbus sees land, he comments, &quot;It's America, all right... just look at those spacious skies... those amber waves of grain... dig that purple mountain's majesty... I'll bet there's fruit out there on the plain!&quot;

*In his satirical, musical [[record album]], ''The United States of America, Volume 1'', [[Stan Freberg]] plays Columbus, [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] plays a skeptical King Ferdinand, and [[Colleen Collins]] does Queen Isabella (mimicking [[Tallulah Bankhead]]), resulting in this bit of dialogue: [http://freberg.8m.com/text/usa1.html]

:Ferdinand: Look at him in that hat! Is that a crazy sailor? 
:Isabella: Crazy? I'll tell you how crazy! He's a man with a dream, a vision, a vision of a new world, whose alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears, with purple mountain majesties above the [[Two Cents Plain]] . . . 
:Ferdinand and Columbus: Fruited!
:Isabella: Fruited.

[[Mel Brooks]], on a talk show, once did an impression of how [[Frank Sinatra]] might sing the song, complete with tuxedo, black hat and coat, and cigarette, leaning up against a bar, and rendering the song in &quot;lounge style&quot;.

[[George Carlin]] performed a satirical version around 1970, when environmental issues were becoming a hot political topic: [http://www.creativequotations.com/one/1309b.htm]

:Oh beautiful, for smoggy skies, insecticided grain
:For strip-mined mountain's majesty above the asphalt plain.
:America, America, man sheds his waste on thee
:And hides the pines with billboard signs, from sea to oily sea!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Assistive Technology''' (AT) is a generic term that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices and the process used in selecting, locating, and using them.  AT promotes greater independence for [[disability|people with disabilities]] by enabling them to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to or changed methods of interacting with the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks. According to disability advocates,  technology, all too often, is created without regard to people with disabilities, and unnecessary barriers make new technology inaccessible to hundreds of millions.

Universal (or broadened) accessibility, or [[universal design]] means excellent [[usability]], particularly for people with disabilities.  But, argue advocates of assistive technology, universally accessible technology yields great rewards to the typical user; good accessible design ''is'' universal design, they say.  The classic example of an assistive technology that has improved everyone's life is the &quot;[[curb cut]]s&quot; in the sidewalk at street crossings.  While these curb cuts surely enable pedestrians with mobility impairments to cross the street, they have also aided parents with carriages and strollers, shoppers with carts, and travellers and workers with pull-type bags, not to mention [[skateboard]]ers and [[inline skate]]rs.

Consider an example of an assistive technology.  The modern [[telephone]] is, except for the deaf, universally accessible.  Combined with a [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|text telephone]] (also known as a TDD [Telephone Device for the Deaf] and in the USA generally called a TTY[TeleTYpewriter]), which converts typed characters into tones that may be sent over the telephone line, the deaf person is able to communicate immediately at a distance.  Together with &quot;relay&quot; services (where an operator reads what the deaf person types and types what a hearing person says) the deaf person is then given access to everyone's telephone, not just those of people who possess text telephones.  Many telephones now have volume controls, which are primarily
intended for the benefit of people who are hard of hearing, but can be useful for all
users at times and places where there is significant background noise.

Another example: [[calculator]]s are cheap, but a person with a mobility impairment can have difficulty using them.  [[Speech recognition]] software could recognize short commands and make use of calculators a little easier.  People with cognitive disabilities would appreciate the simplicity; others would as well.

Toys which have been adapted to be used by children with disabilities, may have advantages for &quot;typical&quot; children as well. The [[Lekotek]] movement assists parents by lending assistive technology toys and expertise to families.

Telecare is a particular sort of assistive technology that uses electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer.  A good example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]).  The principle being that these alerts can be customised to the particular person's risks.  When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a carer or contact centre who can respond appropriately.  The range of sensors is wide and expanding rapidly.

Technology similar to Telecare can also be used to act within a person's home rather than just to respond to a detected crisis. Using one of the examples above, unlit gas sensors for people with dementia can be used to trigger a device that turns off the gas and tells someone what has happened. This is safer than just telling an external person that there is a problem.

Designing for people with dementia is a good example of where the design of the interface of a piece of assistive technology (AT) is critical to its usefulness. It is important to make sure that people with dementia or any other identified user group are involved in the design process to make sure that the design is accessible and useable. In the example above, a voice message could be used to remind the person with dementia to turn of the gas himself, but who's voice should be used, and what should the message say? Questions like these must be answered through user consultantion, involvement and evaluation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about|the calculator|the flat slab at the top of a column|[[abacus (architecture)]]}}
An '''abacus''' is a calculation tool, often constructed as a wooden frame with beads sliding on wires.  It was in use centuries before the adoption of the written [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and is still widely used by merchants and clerks in [[China]] and elsewhere.

The origins of the abacus are disputed, suggestions including invention in [[Babylonia]] and in [[China]], to have taken place between 2400 BC and 300 BC. The first abacus was almost certainly based on a flat stone covered with sand or dust.  Lines were drawn in the sand and pebbles used to aid calculations. From this, a variety of abaci were developed;  the most popular were based on the bi-quinary system, using a combination of two bases (base-2 and base-5) to represent decimal numbers

The use of the word ''abacus'' dates back to before 1387 when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from ''abakos'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of ''abax'' (&quot;calculating-table&quot;). Because ''abax'' also had the sense of &quot;table sprinkled with sand or dust, used for drawing geometric figures,&quot; it is speculated by some linguists that the Greek word may be derived from a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Root (philology)|root]], ''ƒÅbƒÅq'', the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for &quot;dust.&quot;  Though details of the transmission are obscure, it may also be derived from the [[Phoenician]] word ''abak'', meaning &quot;sand&quot;. The plural of abacus is abaci.

== Babylonian abacus ==
{{Main|Babylonian abacus}}
A tablet found on the island of Salamis (near Greece) in 1846 dates back to the Babylonians of 300 BC making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It was originally thought to be a gaming board. 

Its construction is a slab of white marble measuring 149cm in length, 75cm in width and 4.5cm thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet are a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semi-circle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semi-circle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.

== Roman abacus ==
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[image:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|Reconstruction of Roman Abacus]] 
  &lt;!-- This image is a 2004 photograph of the Mainz reconstruction of the 
  original in the Paris Library.  It gives a much clearer picture that the 
  device is not beads on wires than the drawing used in this entry earlier.  
  If we are only allowed one image then this is the better to use.    
  [[User:Mfc|mfc]] --&gt;

The [[Roman Empire|Late Empire]] [[Roman abacus]] shown here in reconstruction contains eight long and eight shorter grooves, the former having up to five beads in each and the latter one.

The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions.  The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives&amp;mdash;five units, five tens, ''etc.'', essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]].  The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman ounces.

Computations are made by means of beads which would probably have been slid up and down the grooves to indicate the value of each column.

==Chinese abacus==
{{Main|Chinese abacus}}
The '''suanpan''' ({{zh-stp|s=&amp;#31639;&amp;#30424;|t=&amp;#31639;&amp;#30436;|p=su&amp;agrave;np&amp;aacute;n}}) of the [[China|Chinese]] is similar to the Roman abacus in principle, though has a different construction, and it was designed to do both decimal and hexadecimal arithmetics.

[[image:abacus_6.png|right|Chinese abacus, the suanpan]]
The Chinese abacus is typically around 20 cm (8 inches) tall and it comes in various widths depending on the application.  It usually has more than seven rods.  There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal computation.  The beads are usually rounded and made of a hard wood.  The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam.  The abacus can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center. 

Chinese abaci can be used for functions other than counting.  Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed.

'''Bead arithmetic''' is the calculating technique used with various types of abaci, in particular the Chinese abacus.

== Japanese abacus (Soroban) ==
The Japanese eliminated (first) one bead from the upper deck and (later) another bead from the lower deck in each column of the Chinese abacus. The Japanese also eliminated the use of Qiuchu (Chinese division table).  The method of Chinese division table was still used when there were 5 lower beads.  There came the war of the Multiplication Table versus the Division Table.  The school of Multiplication table prevailed in 1920s.  The rods (number of digits) increase to usually 21, 23, 27 or even 31, thus allowing calculation for more digits.

Soroban is taught in elementary schools as a part of lessons in mathematics. When teaching the soroban, a song-like instruction is given by the tutor. The soroban is about 8 cm (3 inches) tall.  The beads on a soroban are usually shaped as a double cone (bi-cone) to facilitate ease of movement.

Often, primary students may bring along with them two sorobans, one with 1 upper bead and 5 lower beads, the other with 1 upper bead with 4 lower beads, when they learn soroban in school.

The size of beads of soroban is standardized, and they come in two types: the &quot;Japanese&quot; classified soroban for native Japanese, and a separate size for foreigners (since Westerners tend to be larger than most Japanese, and therefore have larger hands and fingers).  The soroban that are for foreigners are made with a plastic pipe on both the left and right side of the frame, while ones made for native Japanese were all made with wooden frames. In this way the &quot;thickness&quot; of the soroban (for foreigners) is higher, rendering it easier for the non-Japanese to manipulate.



&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Soroban.JPG|none|thumb|400px|Japanese soroban]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Russian abacus ==
[[Image:Schoty_abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the [[schoty]] or sjotty (&amp;#1089;&amp;#1095;&amp;#1105;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1099;), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four, and acts as a separator or for fractions). This wire is usually near the user. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, in order to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually have a colour different to the other 8 beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

The Russian abacus is still in common use today in shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], although it is no longer taught in most schools.

== School abacus ==
[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|right|150px|thumb|School abacus used in Danish elementary school. Early 20th century.]] 

Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching arithmetics. In Western countries, a '''bead frame''' similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

== Uses by the visually impaired ==
Abaci are still commonly used by individuals who have [[blindness|visual impairments]].  They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cubic root]].  A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they don't move inadvertently.  This keeps the beads in place while the user feels or manipulates them.

Recently, abaci have been replaced to some extent by electronic calculators with speech, but only in those countries where they are easily available and affordable.  However, even when they are available, many visually impaired people still prefer to use the abacus.  In addition, many blind children are required to learn how to use the abacus before they are permitted the use of a talking calculator or similar device.  This can be compared to sighted children being required to learn how to solve mathematical problems on paper before they are allowed the use of a calculator.

== Native American abacus ==
Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''Nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient Mayan culture. This Mesoamerican abacus uses the 5-digit base-20 [[Mayan numerals|Mayan numeral]] system.

The [[khipu]] of the [[Inka]]s was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data - like advanced [[tally stick]]s&amp;mdash;but was not used to perform calculations.

{{For|the cyber novellete by Nadeem Parachee|Acidity (Novelette)}}

An '''acid''' (often represented by the generic formula '''HA''') is a water-soluble, sour-tasting [[chemical compound]] that when dissolved in [[water]], gives a solution with a [[pH]] of less than 7. 

== Definitions of acids and bases ==

The word &quot;acid&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] ''acidus'' meaning &quot;sour&quot;, but in [[chemistry]] the term acid has a more specific meaning.  There are three common [[Acid-base reaction theories|ways to define an acid]], namely, the '''Arrhenius''', the '''Br√∏nsted-Lowry''' and the '''Lewis''' definitions, in order of increasing generality.

* '''Arrhenius''': According to this definition, an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) when dissolved in water, while bases are substances that increase the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  This definition limits acids and bases to substances that can dissolve in water.  Around 1800, many [[France|French]] chemists, including [[Antoine Lavoisier]], incorrectly believed that all acids contained [[oxygen]]. [[England|English]] chemists, including [[Sir Humphry Davy]] at the same time believed all acids contained hydrogen. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] used this belief to develop this definition of acid.

* '''Br√∏nsted-Lowry''': According to this definition, an acid is a [[proton]] donor and a base is a proton acceptor. The acid is said to be dissociated after the proton is donated.  An acid and the corresponding base are referred to conjugate acid-base pairs.  [[Johannes Nicolaus Br√∏nsted|Br√∏nsted]] and [[Martin Lowry|Lowry]] formulated this definition, which includes water-insoluble substances not in the Arrhenius definition. 

* '''Lewis''': According to this definition, an acid as an electron-pair acceptor and a base is an electron-pair donor.  (These are frequently referred to as &quot;[[Lewis acid]]s&quot; and &quot;[[Lewis base]]s,&quot; and are [[electrophile]]s and [[nucleophile]]s in [[organic chemistry]]).  Lewis acids include substances with no [[protons]], such as [[iron(III) chloride]].  The Lewis definition can also be explained with [[molecular orbital]] theory. In general, an acid can receive an electron pair in its lowest unoccupied orbital ([[LUMO]]) from the highest occupied orbital ([[HOMO]]) of a base.  That is, the HOMO from the base and the LUMO from the acid combine to a bonding [[molecular orbital]].  This definition was developed by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]].

Although not the most general theory, the Br√∏nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition.  The strength of an acid may be understood by this defintion by the stability of [[hydronium]] and the solvated conjugate base upon dissociation.  Increasing stability of the the conjugate base will increase the acidity of a compound.  This concept of acidity is used frequently for organic acids such as [[carboxylic acid]].  The molecular orbital description, where the unfilled proton orbital overlaps with a lone pair, is connected to the Lewis definition.

Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.

Acid/base systems are different from [[redox]] reactions in that there is no change in oxidation state.

Generally, acids have the following chemical and physical properties:
* '''Taste''': Acids generally are sour when dissolved in water.
* '''Touch''': Acids produce a stinging feeling, particularly strong acids.
* '''Reactivity''': Acids react aggressively with or corrode  most [[metal]]s. 
* '''Electrical conductivity''': Acids are [[electrolyte]]s.

[[Strong acid]]s are dangerous, causing severe burns for even minor contact. Generally, acid burns are treated by rinsing the affected area abundantly with water and followed up with immediate medical attention.

== Nomenclature ==

Acids are named according to the ending of their [[anion]]. That ionic ending is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table below. For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid.

== Chemical characteristics ==

In water the following [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] occurs between an acid (HA) and water, which acts as a base:

HA(aq) {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

The [[acidity constant]] (or acid dissociation constant) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of HA with water:

:&lt;math&gt;K_a = {[\mbox{H}_3\mbox{O}^+]\cdot[A^-] \over [HA]}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Strong acid]]s have large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values (i.e. the reaction equilibrium lies far to the right; the acid is almost completely dissociated to H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  Strong acids include the heavier [[hydrohalic acid]]s: [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), and [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI). (However, [[hydrofluoric acid]], HF, is relatively weak.) For example, the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value for [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) is 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Weak acid]]s have small ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values (i.e. at equilibrium significant amounts of HA and A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; exist together in solution; modest levels of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are present; the acid is only partially dissociated). For example, the K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value for acetic acid is 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;.  Most organic acids are weak acids.  [[Oxoacid]]s, which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen may be quite strong or weak.  [[Nitric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]], and [[perchloric acid]] are all strong acids, whereas [[nitrous acid]], [[sulfurous acid]] and [[hypochlorous acid]] are all weak. 

Note the following:
* The terms &quot;[[hydrogen]] ion&quot; and &quot;proton&quot; are used interchangebly; both refer to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
* In aqueous solution, the water is protonated to form [[hydronium]] ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq).  This is often abbreviated as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) even though the symbol is not chemically correct.
* The strength of an acid is measured by its [[acid dissociation constant]] (''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) or equivalently its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;= - log(''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). 
* The [[pH]] of a solution is a measurement of the concentration of [[hydronium]].  This will depend of the concnetration and nature of acids and bases in solution.

=== Polyprotic acids ===

[[Polyprotic]] acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as '''diprotic acid''' (two potenital protons to donate) and '''triprotic acid''' (three potenital protons to donate)  

A monoprotic acid can undergo one [[dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as follows and simply has one acid dissociation constant as shown above:

:::::HA(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;


A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH.  Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .  For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), for which ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), wherein the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; is intermediate strength.  The large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid.  In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Both ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are small, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .


A triprotic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt; .

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;

An [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]].  All three protons can be successively lost to yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, then HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, and finally PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; , the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]].  An [[Organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.  Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.

== Neutralization ==

[[Neutralization]] is the reaction between equal amounts of an acid and a base, producing a [[salt]] and [[water (molecule)|water]]; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water:

::HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) + NaCl(aq)

Neutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[PH indicator|pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''The term '''asphalt''' is often used as an abbreviation for [[asphalt concrete]].''

'''Asphalt''' is a sticky, black and highly [[viscosity|viscous]] liquid or semi-solid that is present in most crude [[petroleum]]s and in some natural deposits.  Asphalt is composed almost entirely of [[bitumen]]. There is some disagreement amongst [[chemist]]s regarding the structure of asphalt, however it is most commonly modeled as a [[colloid]], with ''asphaltenes'' as the dispersed phase and ''maltenes'' as the continuous phase.

Asphalt is sometimes confused with [[tar]], which is an artificial material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[organic matter]].  Tar is also predominantly composed of bitumen, however the bitumen content of tar is typically lower than that of asphalt.  Tar and asphalt have very different engineering properties.

Asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], [[gasoline]] and [[diesel]]) by the process of [[fractional distillation]], usually under [[vacuum]] conditions. A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a [[de-asphalting unit]] which uses either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated. Further processing is possible by &quot;blowing&quot; the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This makes the product harder and more viscous.

Natural deposits of asphalt include Lake Asphalts (primarily from the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Bermudez Lake]] in [[Venezuela]]), [[Gilsonite]], the [[Dead Sea]] in [[Israel]], and [[Tar Sands]].  

Asphalt is rather hard to transport in bulk (it hardens unless kept very hot) so it is sometimes mixed with [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] before shipping. Upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called '''bitumen feedstock''', or BFS.

The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for [[Pavement (material)|pavement]]s, which accounts for approximately 80% of the asphalt consumed in the [[United States]].  [[Roof]]ing [[shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include [[cattle spray]]s, fence post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.

In the ancient [[middle-east]] natural asphalt deposits were used for [[mortar (masonry)| mortar]] between bricks and stones, ship [[caulking | caulk]], and waterproofing. The [[Persian language | Persian]] word for asphalt is ''mumiya'', which may be the source for the English word [[mummy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American National Standards Institute''' (ANSI) is a nonprofit organization that oversees the development of standards for products, services, processes and systems in the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.  For example, standards make sure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for them anywhere around the globe. 

The American National Standards Institute approves standards that are developed by representatives of standards developing organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others. These standards make sure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way.

ANSI accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards. The ANSI accreditation programs conform to international guidelines as verified by government and peer review assessments.

In 1918, five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). The AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA) in 1928. In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). The present name was adopted in 1969. The organization's headquarters are in Washington, D.C. For more information see its Web site at http://www.ansi.org. 

The '''ASA''' photographic exposure system became the basis for the ISO [[film speed]] system, currently used worldwide.

In [[Microsoft Windows]], the phrase &quot;ANSI&quot; refers to the [[Windows ANSI code page]]s. Most of these are fixed width though there are some variable width ones for [[ideographic language]]s. Some of these are very close to the [[ISO-8859]] series leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.

[[ASCII art]] which is colorized or animated by way of ANSI terminal control codes (X3.64 sequences) are commonly referred to as &quot;[[ANSI art]]&quot; and were predominantly popular on [[bulletin board system]]s throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

'''Anchorage''' is a Unified [[Home Rule]] [[Municipality]] (officially called the '''Municipality of Anchorage''') in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]]. It is also a [[census area]]. With 260,283 residents according to the [[U.S. Census, 2000|2000 census]], Anchorage is the largest city in the state of [[Alaska]], composing more than two-fifths of the state's population. A State of Alaska Demographer in 2004 estimates the population at 277,498. Anchorage was founded in 1915 and named after a place where a ship lies at [[anchor]].  Its official [[List of city nicknames|nickname]] is &quot;The City of Lights and Flowers&quot;. Garden writers call Anchorage the &quot;Hanging Basket Capital of the World&quot; when it comes to the city's 100,000 hanging baskets, and aviation buffs refer to the city as the &quot;Air Crossroads of the World&quot; because of its geographical location between the two northern continents. 

In downtown Anchorage along the streets and sidewalks are 425 baskets of bright gold triploid marigold drenched with trailing sapphire lobelia. The blue and gold flowers represent the colors of the Municipality of Anchorage flag and the [[Flag of Alaska|Alaska state flag]]. The city of Anchorage blooms with vibrant color during the late spring and summer when it comes to [[flowers]].   

Today Anchorage has many features of a modern [[urban area]], such as [[park]]s and forests, bike and city trails, [[skiing]] and cross-country ski trails, business and [[commerce]], theaters and other [[entertainment]]s. The [[tourist industry]] is strong and offers many activities and attractions.

== History ==
{{main|History of Anchorage, Alaska}}

Russia was well-established in North America by the 1800s. In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] brokered a [[Alaska purchase|deal to purchase Alaska]] from debt-ridden [[Russia]] for $7.2 million, about two cents an acre. Alaska's value was not appreciated by the American masses at that time, calling it &quot;'''Seward's folly'''&quot;, &quot;'''Seward's icebox'''&quot; and &quot;'''Walrussia'''&quot;. By 1888, gold was discovered along [[Turnagain Arm]]. In 1912, Alaska became a [[United States Territory]]. Anchorage was carefully laid out by city planners in 1914, originally as a [[railroad]] [[construction]] [[port]] for the [[Alaska Railroad]], and on [[July 9]], [[1915]], the first sale of town lots was held. In 1915 President [[Woodrow Wilson]] authorized funds for the construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]]. That same year the Anchorage [[Chamber of Commerce]] was formed. Ship Creek Landing in Anchorage was selected as the headquarters of this effort. Soon a &quot;Tent City&quot; sprang up at the mouth of Ship Creek and the population quickly swelled to more than 2,000. Would-be entrepreneurs flocked to this bustling frontier town, and they brought with them everything necessary to build a city. A popular hardware and clothing store, &quot;The Anchorage,&quot; was actually an old dry-docked steamship named &quot;Berth.&quot; Although the area had been known by various names, the [[U.S. Post Office]] Department formalized the use of the name &quot;Anchorage,&quot; and despite some protests the name stuck. In 1920, the United States government relinquished its direct control over the city, and elections were held. Anchorage was incorporated on [[November 23]], [[1920]]. In 1923, [[William Mulcahy]] establishes the Anchorage Baseball League. Mulcahy was a baseball fan who was working as the Alaska Railroad station auditor assistant and established the baseball league in his spare time. Later in life, Mulcahy introduced Little League baseball and established the city's [[YMCA]]. The Mulcahy Park stadium and ball field were named in his honor for his contributions to early Anchorage. 

The 1930s were a time that Anchorage rebounded from the loss of population and industry it had suffered during [[World War I]]. [[Air transportation]] became increasingly important to Anchorage.  
In 1930, the original &quot;Park Strip&quot; landing field was replaced by a new facility, [[Merrill Field]], which had a beacon and a control [[tower]], and in a few short years, it became one of the busiest centers of [[civilian]] [[aircraft]] activity in the [[United States]]. In 1937, [[Providence Alaska Medical Center]] opened its doors.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anchorage-1940s2.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Fourth Avenue in the 1940s.]] --&gt;
The arrival of US Army troops in 1940 marked a decade of growth based on military expansion for Anchorage. Growth spurted in the 1940s, with the construction of [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]] and [[Fort Richardson]], which made Anchorage a major defense center. In 1940, a canal was built connecting [[Lake Spenard]] with [[Lake Hood]], making it the world's largest [[seaplane]] base. The outbreak of [[World War II]] with the threat of a Japanese invasion prompted continued expansion of military personnel and aircraft, and later the pressures of the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] ensured continued heavy military investment in the Anchorage area. In 1947, the [[parking meter]] was introduced in Anchorage, and in 1949, the first [[traffic light]]s were installed on Fourth Avenue. Between 1939 and 1950, Anchorage's population spurted from 4,230 to 30,060, and the cost of living soared. Anchorage also experienced an unfortunate rise in crime during this tumultuous growth period, a problem the city would fight for decades.

The decade of the 1950s was also eventful. In 1951 came the opening of the [[Seward Highway]]. On [[December 10]], [[1951]], Anchorage established itself as the &quot;Air Crossroads of the World&quot; when Anchorage International Airport opened with transpolar airline traffic flying between Western [[Europe]] and East [[Asia]]. The new airport also became a refueling stop for flights between the contiguous 48 states and East Asia, until nonstop flights became practical around 1970, with the Boeing 747 airliner. In 1953, [[health care]] expanded with the opening of the [[Alaska Native Medical Center]]. Also, three volcanoes erupted in the area, including [[Mount Spurr]], which dumped several inches of ash on Anchorage. [[KTVA]], the city's first [[television station]], began broadcasting in 1953. In 1954, the [[Alyeska Resort]] was established. In 1957, oil was discovered on the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. On [[January 3]], [[1959]], Alaska joined the union as the 49th state. 

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anc65.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Downtown Anchorage in 1965.]] --&gt;
The decade of the 1960s began on a bright note for Anchorage after Alaska's attaining statehood. After Alaska became a state, Anchorage faced a severe housing shortage, which was solved partially by [[suburb|suburban expansion]]. In January 1964, Anchorage became both a City and a Borough. But on [[March 27]], [[1964]], Anchorage was hit by the [[Good Friday Earthquake]], which registered 9.2 on the [[Richter scale]] and caused tremendous destruction in south Alaska. This earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in [[North America]] and [[United States]] history, and Anchorage lay only 75 miles (120 km) from the [[epicenter]]. It killed 131 people across [[South Central Alaska]], and property damage was estimated at over $300 million (1964 dollars). The brand new J.C. Penney department store in Anchorage was flattened. Anchorage's remarkable recovery from this disaster dominated life in the late 1960s. The continued threat of earthquakes has prompted a limit on the height of buildings in the city; the tallest buildings are 21 stories high. In 1968, Kincaid Park was created in South Anchorage from a former [[Project Nike|Nike]] surface-to-air missile site. That same year, oil was discovered in [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] on the Arctic Slope and, in 1969, oil-lease sales brought billions of dollars to the state.

[[Image:Statue_of_Balto_in_Anchorage.jpg|thumb|right|Statue in downtown Anchorage of [[Balto|Balto]], the lead sled dog during the last part of the [[Iditarod]] serum run.]]
The decade of the 1970s was an important time of growth for the Anchorage economy.  On [[March 3]], [[1973]], the first 1049-mile-long (1690 km) [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] started from downtown Anchorage with 34 mushers. Twenty-two mushers finished the race, with the last one arriving in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] one-month after he left the starting line. In recent years, winners have finished the race in less than 10 days. In 1974, construction begain on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]], with [[Valdez]], not Anchorage, as its southern terminus. The oil discovery and pipline construction fueled a modern-day boom when oil and construction companies set up their headquarters in Anchorage. The pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of more than $8 billion. In 1975, Bicentennial Park was created in Southeast Anchorage. On [[September 15]], [[1975]], the city and borough consolidated forming a [[unified government]]. Also included in this unification were [[Eagle River, Alaska|Eagle River]], [[Eklutna, Alaska|Eklutna]], [[Girdwood, Alaska|Girdwood]], [[Glen Alps, Alaska|Glen Alps]], and several other communities. The unified area became officially known as the [[Anchorage Municipality|Municipality of Anchorage]]. By 1980, the population of Anchorage had grown to 174,431. 

The decade of the 1980s was a time of growth, thanks to a flood of North Slope oil revenue into the state treasury. Capital projects and an aggressive beautification program, combined with far-sighted community planning, greatly increased infrastructure and quality of life. These included a new [[library]], [[civic center]], [[arena|sports arena]], and [[performing arts center]]. The 1980s was also a time when Alaska's up-and-down economy struck. The price of oil dropped dramatically, and recession hit Anchorage. But in 1984, [[Hilltop Ski Area]] was established, which along with the [[Alyeska Resort]] in [[Girdwood, Alaska|Girdwood]], and [[Alpenglow at Arctic Valley]] gave residents three fully- operational skiing areas, benefitting tourism and recreational activities. In 1986, Kincaid Outdoor Center opens. In 1989, [[Mount Redoubt]] erupted again, curtailing aviation in the Anchorage area for a short period of time. 

The decade of the 1990s was a time when Anchorage saw gold. In 1996, the Arctic Winter Games were held in [[Chugiak]]/[[Eagle River, Alaska|Eagle River]] and, in 1999, the [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] opened.

On [[July 8]], [[2000]], the municipal airport was renamed &quot;[[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]&quot; in honor of Alaska's longest-serving [[United States Senator]].

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:AnchoragewithMcKinleyinthebackground.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A view of downtown Anchorage with a clear view of [[Mount McKinley]] ([[Denali]]) in background.]] --&gt;
In spite of the height limitations on buildings, Anchorage today has an attractive skyline nevertheless, particularly with the [[Chugach Mountains]], [[Cook Inlet]], or the often-visible [[Mount McKinley]] (also known as [[Denali]]) as a backdrop. From Government Hill, one can see the best view of Mount McKinley. Though space is limited in the &quot;Anchorage bowl,&quot; as locals call the peninsula on which the city is located, many parks, greenbelts, and other undeveloped areas can be found within the city itself, making it particularly attractive to nature lovers (to say nothing of the attractions available just a short distance outside the city). Over the past thirty years, however, many of these undeveloped areas have filled in with houses, strip malls, and other development. Nonetheless, there is an enormous amount of land under the Anchorage Municipal control, which totals some 1,955 square miles (5063 km&amp;sup2) - about the size of Delaware. The majority of this land is located within the [[Chugach Mountains]] to the east of the city, which also comprises [[Chugach State Park]].

== Geography and climate ==
=== Geography ===
[[Image:Vicinity map of Municipality of Anchorage.gif|right|350px]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the municipality has a total area of 5,079.2 [[Square Kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (1,961.1 [[Square Mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]), 4,395.8 km&amp;sup2; (1,697.2 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 683.4 km&amp;sup2; (263.9 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water. The total area is 13.46% water.

Anchorage is located in [[South Central Alaska]], at 61 ¬∞13'06&quot;North [[latitude]] (about the same as [[Stockholm]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]), -149 ¬∞53'57&quot;West [[longitude]] (about the same as [[Hawaii]]), northeast of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]], and [[Cook Inlet]], due north of the [[Kenai Peninsula]], northwest of [[Prince William Sound]] and [[Alaska Panhandle]], and nearly due south of [[Mount McKinley]]/[[Denali]].  The city is situated on a triangular [[peninsula]] bordered on the east by the rugged, scenic, and eminently hike-worthy [[Chugach Mountains]], on the northwest by the [[Knik Arm]], and on the southwest by the [[Turnagain Arm]], upper branches of the Cook Inlet, which itself is the northernmost reach of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Despite this, the city lacks coastal beaches, instead having wide, treacherous [[mudflats]]. Adjacent to the north is [[Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska]].  To the south is [[Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska]], and to the east is [[Valdez-Cordova Census Area, Alaska]].

=== Climate ===
Average daytime summer temperatures are approximately 55 to 80 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (13 to 27 degrees [[Celsius]]); average daytime winter temperatures are about 5 to 20 degrees (-15 to -7 degrees Celsius) (warmer than many places in the [[The Lower 48|contiguous United States]]). Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (PANC) average January low and high temperatures are 9 ¬∞F / 22 ¬∞F (-13 ¬∞C / -5 ¬∞C) with an average winter snowfall of 70.60 inches (179.3 cm). The weather on any given day and indeed for entire seasons can be very unpredictable.  Some winters feature several feet of snow and bitterly cold temperatures, while others, just a foot or two of snow and frequent thaws, which puts dangerous ice on the streets. On [[March 17]], [[2002]], a record 24-hour ([[St. Patrick's Day]]) [[snow]] storm dumped 25.7 inches (65.3 cm) of snow on the Anchorage area, causing the airport and schools to close on that day, and several days longer for the schools. The 1954-1955 winter had 132.8 inches (337.3 cm), which made it the snowiest winter on record. The coldest [[temperature]] ever recorded at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] was -38 ¬∞F (-38.8 ¬∞C) on [[February 3]], [[1948]].  Summers are typically very mild and pleasant, though it can rain frequently.  There isn't any beach-bathing in Anchorage, except at a few local lakes on the warmest summer days, when those lakeside beaches can be extremely popular. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport average July low and high temperatures are 52 ¬∞F / 66 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C / 19 ¬∞C) and the hottest reading ever recorded was 86 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C) on [[June 25]], [[1953]]. The average annual precipitation at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is 16.07 inches (40.8 cm). Aside from the winter cold, which most Alaskans don't mind, there are two primary nuisances associated with the seasons: in the summer, mosquitoes (which are much worse out in [[Alaskan Bush|the Bush]] than in the city itself); in the winter, long nights and very short days.  Since Anchorage is at such a high latitude, for months in mid-winter, residents go to work in the dark and return home in the dark.  Those who don't study or work next to a window can go all week long without seeing the sun.

Anchoragites exemplify many of the qualities to be found among Alaskans generally: independence, friendliness, practical-mindedness, and a love of the outdoors.  There is, even among businesspeople in Anchorage, a tendency to &quot;dress down&quot;. (There is no [[dress code]] in any Anchorage restaurant.)  This, and a sort of frontier spirit that still lives on in [[Alaska]] generally, gives Anchorage a relatively casual, relaxed atmosphere compared to some other American cities.  (These cultural characteristics are only more exaggerated the farther one moves out of the city into the rest of [[Alaska]].) The city has traditionally served as a destination for immigrants, and there are active [[Asian]], [[Eastern European]], and [[Hispanic]] populations, along with communities of [[African Americans]] and various groups of [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] Alaskans. Over 95 languages are spoken by students in the Anchorage School District.

Both military bases together station over 9,000 military personnels. 

Numerous visitor and [[tourist]] facilities and services are available throughout the Municipality of Anchorage. Nearly all [[Alaska Interior]]-bound tourists pass through Anchorage at some stage of their journeys in Alaska. This is particulatly true since the [[Alaska Railroad]] has its southern terminus in Anchorage. Not surprisingly, the summer is [[tourist|tourist season]], and downtown Anchorage, as well as the highways and railroads leading north and south of the city, are typically teeming with tourists. Anchorage has seasonal factors contribute to a fluctuating, though low, unemployment rate.

The best ski jumper from the U.S. in the past 15 years is from Anchorage, Alan Alborn. He has finished 4th in a stage of the World Cup in [[Engelberg]], [[Switzerland]], and has a 11th place from the [[2002 Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. He also holds the US skiflying record with 221,5 meters from 2002 in [[Planica]], [[Slovenia]].

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anc-downtown-night-1072.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Downtown Anchorage at night.]] --&gt;
Anchorage is usually the starting or ending point of most visitors' Alaska vacations, and it serves as the airline hub for the state, being serviced by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]. Anchorage is served by some national airlines, primarily Seattle-based [[Alaska Airlines]], as well as a number of international airlines. The [[Alaska Railroad]] offers daily summer service to [[Seward]], [[Talkeetna]], [[Denali National Park]], and [[Fairbanks]]. These communities are also served by inter-city bus line from Anchorage. Transportation to downtown Anchorage is convenient by taxicab, airport shuttle, or hotel courtesy shuttles. Upon arrival, visitors can stop by the Anchorage Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau Visitor Information Center or the Alaska Visitors Center for direction. Diamond Airport Parking offers long-term parking with free 24-hour shuttle service to the airport. [[Cruise]] passengers with a few hours or a full day to explore Anchorage can store their luggage (and fish) at the airport. The Ship Creek Shuttle connects key downtown Anchorage locations with the Ship Creek area, including stops at the Alaska Railroad Depot.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Tourist_returning_to_Anchorage_from_Denali_National_Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alaska Railroad tourist returning to Anchorage from [[Denali National Park]].]]  --&gt;
Anchorage also has a [[public transit|bus system]] called People Mover [http://www.muni.org/transit], with a central hub in downtown Anchorage and satellite hubs at [[Dimond Center]] and [[Muldoon Mall]].  People Mover also provides point-to-point van services to seniors and those with disabilities, as well as car pool organization services.

There is only one officially designated [[Interstate Highway]] in Alaska. Unlike the Interstate routes in [[Hawaii]], it is unsigned as such. The route, officially [[Interstate A-1]] runs along the Seward and Glenn Highways. The highway is numbered [[Alaska State Highway 1]]. About 10 miles of the [[Seward Highway]],  (known as the New Seward Highway) is built to [[freeway]] standards. The [[Glenn Highway]], also built to freeway standards goes northeast from Anchorage, six lanes carrying commuter traffic to and from Eagle River, Chugiak, and the Matanuska Valley towns of [[Palmer]] and [[Wasilla]]. The highway is four lanes wide from Eagle River to the junction with the Parks Highway ([[Alaska State Highway 3]]) near Wasilla. Anchorage's roads and the state's highways are all asphalt. They are plowed when necessary in the winter. Highway construction and maintenance is limited to the warm months, so expect some delays.

As of 2005, Anchorage has a long-range transportation plan. Building the Highway to Highway Connection as a limited-access highway link between the Glenn and Seward highways could be the backbone that efficiently delivers traffic to many destinations throughout the city.

Today, traffic is heavy all day long 5th-6th Avenues, Ingra and Gambell, and spills into East Anchorage neighborhoods to avoid congestion. In the Fairview, Mountain View, and Midtown neighborhoods, the new road link would be dug down, out of sight and covered in some areas to allow easy pedestrian and vehicle access across.

=== Medical centers and hospitals ===
[[Providence Alaska Medical Center]] on Providence Drive in Anchorage is the largest hospital in Alaska and is part of [[Providence Health System]] in [[Alaska]], [[Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]]. It features the state's most comprehensive range of services. Providence Health System has a history of serving Alaska, beginning when the Sisters of Providence first brought health care to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] in 1902. As the territory grew during the following decades, so did efforts to provide care. Their hospitals were opened in [[Fairbanks]] in 1910 and Anchorage in 1937. 

[[Alaska Regional Hospital]] on DeBarr Road in Anchorage was born in 1963 as Anchorage Presbyterian Hospital, located at 8th and L Street downtown. This predecessor to Alaska Regional was a joint venture between local [[physicians]] and the Presbyterian Church. In 1976 the hospital moved to it's present location on DeBarr Road, and is now a 254-bed licensed and accredited facility. Alaska Regional has expanded services and in 1994, Alaska Regional joined with [[HCA]], one of the nation's largest [[healthcare]] providers. 

[[Alaska Native Medical Center]] on Tudor Road, provides medical care and therapeutic health care to Native Alaskans - 229 tribes of [[Eskimos]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] - at the Anchorage site and at 15 satellite facilities throughout the state. ANMC specialists also travel to clinics in the bush to provide care. The 150-bed hospital is also a teaching center for the [[University of Washington]]'s regional medical education program. ANMC houses an office of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation jointly own and manage ANMC.

=== Utilities ===
A full complement of [[utilities]] is available within the Anchorage area. Two [[electric]] companies provide service, depending on where you live within the Municipality of Anchorage. They are: Municipal Light &amp; Power (ML&amp;P) and Chugach Electric Association. 

A municipally-owned utility since 1932, ML&amp;P supplies high-quality and reliable electric power to more than 30,000 residential and commercial customers in the Anchorage area. Chugach Electric Association is a not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative that was formed in 1948. 

Most homes have [[natural gas]]-fueled heat. ENSTAR Natural Gas Company is the sole provider for Anchorage, serving some 90-percent of the city's population. While some homes in Anchorage use private [[wells]] and [[septic]] systems, the Municipality of Anchorage owns and operates the Water and Wastewater Utility serving an approximate population base of 214,000.

== Shopping and entertainment ==
Anchorage has restaurants and places to shop. Anchorage 5th Avenue Mall, located in the heart of downtown Anchorage, has 110 stores including [[Nordstrom]], [[JCPenny]], and the [[Gap]]. 

There is a full-size family-owned [[shopping mall]] in Anchorage: [[Dimond Center]] [http://www.dimondcenter.com] located at the intersection of East Dimond Boulevard and Old Seward Highway is the largest shopping center in Alaska, at 728,000 square feet, with 120,000 square feet of professional office space. The mall is home to over 200 stores and offices and 17 eating establishments, with an [[ice skating rink]], [[bowling alley]], [[athletic|athletic club]], [[library]], and [[cinemas|Dimond 9 Cinemas]]. The anchor stores are: [[Best Buy]], [[Gottschalks]], and [[Old Navy]]. Lodging is offered by the 109-room [[Dimond Center Hotel]] [http://www.dimondcenterhotel.com/]. 

The Mall at [[Sears]] located on East Northern Lights Boulevard has great shopping and food court in the center of town. The Northway Mall is located on Penland Parkway near Airport Heights and the Glenn Highway. Ship Creek Center is a place that has Alaska, Russian gifts, dining, groceries and dancing.

== Points of interest ==
There are features of Anchorage that make it unique: the large tidal range; multiple, beautiful cross-country ski trails; America's highest percentage of licensed airplane pilots (with several airports and landing strips in the city or nearby); a very low [[population density]] for a city its size; frequent small earthquakes; spring windstorms (&quot;[[Chinook wind]]s&quot;); active volcanoes nearby (to the southwest, in the [[Alaska Range]], volcanoes such as [[Mount Spurr]], [[Augustine Volcano]], [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Mount Redoubt]], and others have coated the city with ash in recent years); its extreme youth (it was founded in 1915 but didn't grow much until the 1940s); and much else.  Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Anchorage is definitely an ''American'' city, replete with a vibrant business climate, large [[shopping mall]]s, traffic congestion (one can't easily move about by foot and [[public transportation]] in the middle of winter), suburban-style subdivisions and two [[suburbs]], [[Suburb of Eagle River|Eagle River]] and [[Chugiak]], unless one counts the massive numbers of commuters who drive from as far away as the [[Matanuska Valley]] [http://www.alaskavisit.com/] communities of [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]] and [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]].

Anchorage has been named an [[All-America City Award|All America City]] in the years 1956, 1965, 1984-85 and most recently in 2002. The city won its latest award based on civic activities like the 2001 [[Special Olympics Winter Games]] [http://www.specialolympicsalaska.org/] , the [[Anchorage Youth Court]] [http://www.ayc.ak.org/], and [[Bridge Builders]] [http://www.bridgebuilders.ak.org/].

'''''Apollo 11''''' was an [[United States|American]] space mission, part of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]] and the first manned mission to land on the [[Moon]]. It launched on [[July 16]], [[1969]]. On [[July 20]], mission commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and pilot [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin]] became the first humans to set foot on the Moon.

==Mission highlights==
===Launch and lunar landing===
The ''Apollo 11'' mission launched from the 
[[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[July 16]], [[1969]] at 13:32 UTC (9:32 A.M. local time) and entered Earth orbit 12 minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About 30 minutes later, the command/service module pair separated from the last remaining Saturn V stage, turned around, and docked its nose to the top of the lunar module still nestled in the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter .28SLA.29|Lunar Module Adaptor]] 

''Apollo 11'' passed behind the Moon on [[July 19]] and soon after fired its main rocket, entering into lunar orbit. In the several orbits that followed, the crew got passing views of their landing site.

The first ''Apollo'' landing site, in the southern [[Mare Tranquilitatis|Sea of Tranquility]] about 20 km (12 mi) southwest of the crater Sabine D, was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ''[[Ranger 8]]'' and ''[[Surveyor 5]]'' landers, as well as by ''[[Lunar Orbiter]]'' mapping spacecraft, and therefore unlikely to present major landing or [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-vehicular activity (EVA)]] challenges. Armstrong bestowed the name [[Tranquillity Base]] on the landing site immediately after touchdown.

[[Image:Apollo 11 bootprint.jpg|thumb|233px|left|Buzz Aldrin bootprint. It was part of an experiment to test the properties of the lunar [[regolith]].]]

On [[July 20]], [[1969]], while on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon, the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], called ''Eagle'', separated from the Command Module, named ''Columbia''.  Collins, now alone aboard ''Columbia'', carefully inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him.  Soon after, Armstrong and Aldrin fired ''Eagle'''s engine and began their descent.  They soon saw that they were &quot;running long&quot;; ''Eagle'' was 4 seconds further along its descent trajectory than planned, and would land miles west of the intended site.  The [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM navigation and guidance computer]] reported several unusual &quot;program alarms&quot; as it guided the LM's descent.  These alarms tore the crew's attention away from the scene outside as the descent proceeded.  In NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, a young [[Flight controller| controller]] named Steve Bales told the [[Flight controller| flight director]] that it was safe to continue the descent in spite of the alarms.  Once they returned their attention to the view outside, the astronauts saw that their computer was guiding them toward a landing site full of large rocks scattered around a large crater. Armstrong took manual control of the lunar module at that point, and guided it to a landing at 20:17 UTC on [[July 20]] with about 30 seconds' worth of fuel left[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html]. 

[[Image:ap11-KSC-69PC-442.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Saturn V]] carrying ''Apollo 11'' took several seconds to clear the tower on [[July 16]], [[1969]].]]

The program alarms were &quot;executive overflows&quot;, indicating that the computer could not finish its work in the time allotted.  The cause was later determined to be the LM rendezvous radar being left on during the descent, causing the computer to spend unplanned time servicing the unused radar.  Steve Bales received a [[Medal of Freedom]] for his &quot;go&quot; call under pressure. Although Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, they also encountered a premature low fuel warning. It was later found caused by the lunar gravity permitting greater propellant 'slosh', uncovering a fuel sensor; extra baffles in the tanks were subsequently added.

At 2:56 UTC on [[July 21]], six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong made his descent to the Moon surface and took his famous &quot;one giant leap for mankind.&quot;  Aldrin joined him, and the two spent two-and-a-half hours drilling core samples, photographing what they saw and collecting rocks.

They planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through ''Eagle'''s twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60¬∞ field of view. Preparation
required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong had some initial difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his [[Portable Life Support System|PLSS]]. According to veteran moonwalker [[John W. Young|John Young]], a redesign of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] to incorporate a smaller hatch was not followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from ''Apollo'' astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.

[[Image:As11-40-5903HR.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Buzz Aldrin]] poses on the [[Moon]] allowing [[Neil Armstrong]] to photograph both of them using the visor's reflection.]]

The Remote Control Unit controls on Armstrong's chest prevented him from seeing his feet. While climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against ''Eagle'''s side and activate the TV camera. The first images used a [[Slow-scan television]] system and were picked up at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in the USA but with better fidelity by [[Honeysuckle Creek]] in Australia. Minutes later the TV was switched to normal television, and the feed was switched to the more sensitive [[radio telescope]] station at the [[Parkes Observatory]] in [[Australia]]. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and were immediately broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. 

After describing the surface (&quot;very fine grained... almost like a powder&quot;), Armstrong stepped off ''Eagle'''s footpad and into history as the first human to set foot on another world. He reported that moving in the Moon's gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was &quot;perhaps even easier than the simulations.&quot;

In addition to fulfilling President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s, ''Apollo 11'' was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He then collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. He removed the TV camera from the MESA, made a panoramic sweep, and mounted it on a tripod 12 m (40 ft) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. 

[[Image:Apollo 11 plaque closeup on Moon.jpg|right|thumb|Photo of the actual plaque left on the moon (attached to the ladder of the LM Descent Stage).]]

Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle'''s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow. 

[[Image:Apollo 11 launch.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A visible shockwave formed as the [[Saturn V]] encountered Maximum Dynamic Pressure (Max Q) at about 1 minute 20 seconds into the flight (altitude 12.5 km, 4 km downrange, velocity 440m/s).]]

Together the astronauts planted the U.S. flag, then took a phone call from President [[Richard Nixon]]. 

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a laser ranging retroreflector. Then Armstrong loped about 120 m (400 ft) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of East Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes - the only time the hammer was used on ''Apollo 11''. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documented sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 min. 

[[image:as11-40-5886.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Neil Armstrong works at the LM in one of the few photos taken of him from the lunar surface. NASA photo as11-40-5886]]

During this period Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. Rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, however, so Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.

===Lunar ascent and return===
Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than 22 kg (48 lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. 

After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one [[Hasselblad]] camera, and other equipment. Then they lifted off in ''Eagle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ascent stage to rejoin CMP Michael Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.  ''Eagle'' was jettisoned and left in lunar orbit. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an &quot;uncertain location&quot; on the lunar surface.

After more than 2&amp;frac12; hours on the lunar surface, they returned to Collins on board ''Columbia'', bringing 20.87 kilograms of lunar samples with them. The two Moon-walkers had left behind scientific instruments such as a [[retroreflector]] array used for the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]].  They also left an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and other mementos, including a [[lunar plaques|plaque]] (mounted on the LM Descent Stage ladder) bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and [[Richard Nixon]].  The inscription read:

:''Here Men From Planet Earth&lt;br&gt;First Set Foot Upon the Moon&lt;br&gt;July 1969 A.D.&lt;br&gt;We Came in Peace For All Mankind.''

The astronauts returned to earth on [[July 24]], welcomed as [[hero]]es. The splashdown point was {{coor dm|13|19|N|169|9|W|}}, 2,660 km (1,440 [[nautical mile|nm]]) east of [[Wake Island]], or 380 km (210 nm) south of [[Johnston Atoll]], and 24 km (15 [[statute mile|mi]]) from the recovery ship, [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|''USS Hornet'']].   

The command module is displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Contingency television address==
The [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. has a copy of the following contingency memo titled &quot;In Event of Moon Disaster&quot; and  dated [[July 18]], [[1969]], which was prepared by [[William Safire]] for President Nixon to read on television, in the event the ''Apollo 11'' astronauts were stranded on the Moon.

:''&quot;Fate has ordained that the men who went to the Moon to explore in peace will stay on the Moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.''

:''These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal: the search for truth and understanding. They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will be mourned by their nation; they will be mourned by the people of the world; they will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown.''

:''In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one; in their sacrifice, they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man. In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.''

:''Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.''

[[Image:Armstrong_16mm.jpg |thumb|right|250px|Armstrong on lunar surface with gold visor raised. From [[16 mm]] film (NASA).]]

:''For every human being who looks up at the Moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.&quot;''

The last line of the statement is reminiscent of a [[Rupert Brooke]] poem called &quot;The Soldier&quot;. The poem starts:

:''If I should die, think only this of me:&lt;br&gt;That there's some corner of a foreign field&lt;br&gt;That is forever England.'' 

Following this address, radio communications with the moon would have been cut off, the astronauts left alone to die, while a clergyman was to commend their souls to &quot;the deepest of the deep&quot; in the fashion of a burial at sea.

==Communications link==
Early in the planning of the [[Project Apollo]], NASA decided to combine all communications between spacecraft and Earth into a single multiplexed feed called 'The Unified S-Band System', including audio communications, television images, crew medical telemetry and the spacecraft systems telemetry.

The signal was picked up by three purpose-built stations (Goldstone (California), Honeysuckle Creek (Australia) and Fresnedillas (Spain) and backed-up by deep space network stations (known as 'wing stations') in Australia, Spain and the United States. At first, the signal was routed to Greenbelt, Maryland, by way of submarine telephone cables, using twelve voice circuits. The signal was divided into twelve parts using inverse multiplexing, sent onto the circuits, and reintegrated in Maryland, before being sent on to NASA in Houston.

Intelsat satellites began taking over the trans-oceanic transmissions toward the end of the 1960s, and NASA ended its contracts for the submarine telephone circuits, which were then reallocated by telephone administrations for normal voice use.

On [[14 July]] [[1969]], the Intelsat satellite over the Atlantic failed. A replacement was launched on 16 July, but went into a useless orbit and would not be reoriented in time to be used. The [[Early Bird]] satellite was activated, but thought it might not have enough power to get a signal to the United States. The Australia station was vital to picking up the signal during the moonwalks, or keeping the astronauts waiting on the moon eight hours before venturing out. A communications team was dispatched to Spain to begin setting up the telephone circuits for NASA's inverse multiplexed signal.

European telecommunications administrators, mostly government post offices, were not accustomed to doing the business required: they would normally require telegram messages to be exchanged, with top level administrative approval, but the twelve circuits had to be recovered from six countries to be made available to NASA, which had set a time limit two hours before launch, or the launch would be canceled. It would be the last ideal launch window before 1970. Other launch windows had been missed due to spacecraft equipment problems. An official with the Spanish communications authority helped the team secure the circuits with his own personal list of contacts.

The last circuit using inverse multiplexing was accepted by NASA just minutes before the time limit. Three days later, the transmissions from the Moon were picked up in Spain, relayed to the United States over the undersea circuits, and made available by NASA to the Americas. They were beamed across the Pacific Ocean, and from the Far East were carried on the Indian Ocean satellite.

The postal/telephone authority in West Germany turned a large radio dish to aim at the Indian Ocean satellite, picking up the signal from Australia and providing it to Western Europe, therefore, viewers in Western Europe saw Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon a full half second later than those in the United States, and some 1.8 seconds after it actually happened.

Had this vital communications link not been restored, the pledge of President [[John F. Kennedy]] to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade would have been missed.

==Mission trivia and urban legends==
===Trivia===
* Some internal NASA planning documents referred to the callsigns of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] as &quot;Snowcone&quot; and &quot;Haystack&quot;; these were quietly changed before being announced to the press.
* Shortly after landing, before preparations have begun for the [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], Aldrin broadcast that -
::''This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.''
:He then took [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], privately. At this time, NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the ''[[Apollo 8]]'' crew reading from the [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Book of Genesis]]), which demanded that their astronauts refrain from religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin (an [[Episcopalian]]) chose to refrain from directly mentioning this. He had kept the plan quiet, not even mentioning it to his wife, and did not reveal it publicly for several years.
* Several books indicate that early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin, not Neil Armstrong, as the first man on the Moon.
* A replica of the footprint left by Neil Armstrong is located in Tranquility Park in [[Houston, Texas]]; the park was dedicated in 1979, a decade after the first moon landing.
* The [[Australia]]n movie, ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000), tells the (slightly fictionalised) story of how the images of the moon-walk were received by the [[radio telescope]] at [[Parkes Observatory]], [[New South Wales]].
* According to the [[HBO]] [[mini-series]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (HBO)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] made the following suggestion as to what Armstrong should say upon stepping onto the lunar surface: &quot;If you had any balls, you'd say 'Oh, my God, what is [[extraterrestrial life|that thing]]?' then scream and cut your [[microphone|mic]].&quot;
* Armstrong claims to have said &quot;That's one small step for ''a'' man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;, although the &quot;''a''&quot; is not at all clear in recordings made at ground control. It has been pointed out that the audio and video links were somewhat intermittent (partly due to storms near [[Parkes Observatory]]). Recently, digital analysis of the tape by NASA revealed the &quot;a&quot; may have been spoken, but obscured by static.[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_362]

===Folklore===
*At some point while on the moon Armstrong supposedly said &quot;Good luck Mr. Gorski&quot;.  Some years later Gorski died, so he felt he could now explain this remark.  As a boy, he heard a couple next door arguing, and the wife said: &quot;Oral sex?  Is it oral sex you want?  You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon, Mr. Gorski!&quot;  This story is untrue. [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/mrgorsky.htm]
* Neil Armstrong apparently took a [[tartan]] where no tartan had been worn before. A tiny swatch of the [[Scottish clan|Clan]] Armstrong plaid was affixed to his suit when he walked on the Moon. Another item that Armstrong took with him was a special diamond-studded [[astronaut pin]] which was given to [[Deke Slayton]] by the widows of the ''[[Apollo 1]]'' crew.  The pin had been intended to be flown in ''Apollo 1'', then given to Deke after the mission, but due to the disaster, the widows ended up giving the pin to him after the funerals.  Deke gave the pin to Neil to leave at Tranquility Base.  
* Two main [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] surround the mission.
** Firstly that the [[Apollo moon landing hoax accusations|landing was a hoax]]. This is generally discounted, although it has slowly grown in popularity, particularly since the release of the movie ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978), which portrays a NASA attempt to fake a landing on Mars.
** Secondly, a less well known [[urban legend]] suggests that they were being 'watched' while on the Moon, and had seen alien vehicles there. This grew in popularity after the book ''Someone else is on our Moon'' was published.
*According to another legend, a survey undertaken in the 1980s in [[Morocco]] revealed that a substantial percentage didn't think man had landed on the Moon; this was not due to conspiracy theory, but rather to that segment not having been informed.

'''''Apollo 8''''' was the second [[Human spaceflight|manned mission]] of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo space program]],  in which Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] became the first humans to leave [[Low Earth orbit|Earth orbit]] and to orbit around the [[Moon]]. It was also the first manned launch of the [[Saturn V]] [[rocket]].

NASA prepared for the mission in only four months. The hardware involved had only been used a few times‚Äîthe Saturn V had launched only twice before, and the Apollo spacecraft had only just finished its first manned mission, ''[[Apollo 7]]''. However, the success of the mission paved the way for the successful completion of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing on the Moon before the end of the decade.

After launching on [[December 21]], [[1968]], the crew took three days to travel to the Moon, which they orbited for 20 hours. While in lunar orbit they made a [[Christmas Eve]] television broadcast. This was one of the most watched broadcasts of all time.

==Planning==
On [[December 22]], [[1966]], [[NASA]] announced the crew for the third manned Apollo flight: Frank Borman, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and Bill Anders. Collins was replaced by his backup Jim Lovell, in July 1968, after Collins had to have surgery as he was suffering cervical intervertebral disc herniation ‚Äî an [[intervertebral disc]] had slipped into the [[spinal cavity]] and required two [[vertebra]]e to be fused together. Collins recovered and went on to be the Command Module Pilot for ''[[Apollo 11]]''.

In September 1967, the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], proposed a series of missions that would lead up to a manned lunar landing. Seven mission types were outlined, each testing a specific set of components and tasks; each previous step needed to be completed successfully before the next mission type could be undertaken. These were:

'''A''' - Unmanned [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) test&lt;/br&gt;
'''B''' - Unmanned [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) test&lt;/br&gt;
'''C''' - Manned CSM in [[low Earth orbit]]&lt;/br&gt;
'''D''' - Manned CSM and LM in low Earth orbit&lt;/br&gt;
'''E''' - Manned CSM and LM in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] Earth orbit with an apogee of 4600&amp;nbsp;mi (7400&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/br&gt;
'''F''' - Manned CSM and LM in lunar orbit&lt;/br&gt;
'''G''' - Manned lunar landing

Of all the components of the Apollo system, the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM), which would eventually be used to land on the Moon, presented the most problems. It was behind schedule and when the first model was shipped to [[Cape Canaveral]] in June 1968, over 101 separate defects were discovered. [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]], which was the lead contractor for the LM, predicted that the first mannable LM, to be used for the D mission, would not be ready until at least February 1969, delaying the entire sequence.

[[Image:Apollo-linedrawing.png|thumb|Apollo CSM diagram (NASA)]]
[[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August. Since the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, they could fly a CSM-only mission in [[December]] [[1968]]. But instead of just repeating the flight of ''[[Apollo 7]]'', the C mission that would fly the CSM in Earth orbit, they could send the CSM all the way to the Moon and maybe even enter into orbit. This mission was dubbed the &quot;C-Prime&quot; mission. This new mission would allow [[NASA]] to test procedures that would be used on the manned lunar landings that would otherwise have to wait until ''[[Apollo 10]]'', the F mission. There were also concerns from the [[CIA]] that the [[Soviets]] were planning their own circumlunar flight for December to upstage the Americans once again (see [[Zond]] program).

[[Image:Ap8-68-HC-70.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the VAB on [[February 1]], [[1968]].]]
Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. However, outvoted by the rest of the agency, he gave his approval. After leading the agency for eight years, he would resign just four days before the launch of ''Apollo 7'', the first manned Apollo flight.

[[Deke Slayton]], the Director of Flight Crew Operations, decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions. [[James McDivitt]], the original commander of the D mission, has said he was never offered the circumlunar flight but would probably have turned it down, as he wanted to fly the lunar module. Borman, on the other hand, jumped at the chance: his original mission would just have been a repeat of the previous flight, except in a higher orbit. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft ‚Äî Borman's crew would now use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.

In the end, the E mission was canceled as most its objectives had been covered by the ''Apollo 8'' and ''Apollo 9'' flights. Mission managers were also confident that ''[[Apollo 10]]'' would also cover the remaining objectives with its lunar orbit flight.

On [[September 9]], the crew entered the [[Space flight simulator|simulators]] to begin their preparation for the flight. By the time the mission flew, the crew would have spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight. Although all crew members were trained for all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize. Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]]. Lovell was trained on [[Celestial navigation|navigating]] the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth. Anders was placed in charge of checking the spacecraft was in working order.

It was not until [[November 12]] that a public announcement was made about the change of mission for ''Apollo 8''. Previous to this [[Thomas O. Paine]], the deputy Administrator of NASA, had made a fleeting remark that all options were being considered.

Borman's main concern during the four months leading up to the launch was keeping the flight plan as simple as possible, not accepting any addition that went beyond the simple objectives of performing the first manned Saturn V launch, going to the Moon and orbiting it. He made sure that they stayed in lunar orbit only as long as necessary ‚Äî 10 orbits.

The crew, now living in the crew quarters at [[Kennedy Space Center]], received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] the night before the launch. They talked about how before his flight, Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from [[New York]] to [[Paris]] on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight. The total was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second.

==The Saturn V==
{{main|Saturn V}}
[[Image:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''Apollo 8'' Saturn V being rolled out to [[Pad 39A]].]]
The Saturn V rocket used by ''Apollo 8'' was designated SA-503, the third flight model. When it was erected in the [[Vertical Assembly Building]] &lt;!-- Editor's Note: At that time it was called the Vertical Assembly Building --&gt;on [[20 December]], [[1967]], it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned test flight carrying a [[boilerplate]] Command/Service Module. Although ''[[Apollo 6]]'' had suffered several major problems (it suffered severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage and two second stage engines shutdown early), [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], in charge of the Saturn V, was confident that it could solve all the issues without the need for another unmanned test flight. The SA-503 mission was thus changed to a manned one.

However, NASA managers did impose some restrictions on a manned flight taking place: the [[S-II]] second stage had to undergo [[cryogenic]] testing at the [[Mississippi Test Facility]] and other changes were to be made to &quot;man-rate&quot; the vehicle. So on [[April 30]], the Saturn V was unstacked and the [[S-II|S-II second stage]] shipped by barge to the test site. The spark igniters on the second and third stage engines were also modified. In May 1968 a leak was found in a first stage engine, requiring it to be replaced.

With only two launches of the Saturn V under its belt, the ground crew at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) was having problems keeping to the schedule. The Grumman crew was also having issues with the lunar module. Concern was expressed at the fact so much work had to be done on the lunar module after it had shipped to the Cape. The ascent engine developed leaks that caused redesigns and valve changes.

Then in August 1968, the entire mission changed. SA-503 would launch men to the Moon and would not be carrying a lunar module, instead carrying a mass equivalent, called a lunar module test article (LTA), similar to ones used for ''[[Apollo 4]]'' and ''[[Apollo 6]]''. In order to speed up the pre-launch preparations, much of the modification of the Saturn V was taken out of the hands of KSC and given to appropriate development centers; only changes that affected crew safety were made. 

The ''Apollo 8'' spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on [[September 21]] and the rocket made the slow 3-mile (5 km) journey to the launch pad on [[9 October]]. Testing continued all through December until the day before launch.

The SA-503 designation stood for Saturn-Apollo, and was used by NASA departments concerned with the launch vehicle. However, departments concerned with the manned flight often used AS-503, standing for Apollo-Saturn; both of these designations were used at the time to refer to the mission as a whole. The -503 number indicated that it was flight number ''3'' (5'''03''') of the Saturn ''V'' ('''5'''03).

==The mission==
===Launch and trans-lunar injection===
[[Image:Ap8-KSC-68PC-329.jpg|thumb|250px|''Apollo 8'' launch. The photo is a [[double exposure]], as the Moon was not visible at the time of launch (NASA)]]
''Apollo 8'' launched at 7:51:00 a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] on [[December 21]], [[1968]]. The entire launch phase was practically flawless with only minor problems. The [[S-IC|S-IC first stage]]'s engines underperformed by 0.75%, causing the engines to burn for 2.45 seconds longer than planned. Towards the end of the second stage burn, the rocket underwent [[pogo oscillation]]s that Frank Borman estimated were of the order of 12 [[Hertz|Hz]] and about ¬±0.25 [[gee|g]] (¬±2.5 m/s&amp;sup2;). The first manned Saturn V placed the spacecraft into a 112.8 mi by 118.9 mi (181.5 km by 191.3 km) Earth orbit with a period of 88 minutes and 10 seconds. The [[apogee]] was also slightly higher than intended, with a planned circular orbit of 115 mi (185 km). The S-IC impacted the Atlantic Ocean at {{coor dm|30|12|N|74|7|W|}} and the S-II at {{coor dm|31|50|N|37|17|W|}}.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 liftoff.ogg|title=Launch of Apollo 8|description=Air-to-ground transmissions from T-15 seconds to T+3 minutes|format=[[Ogg]]}}

For the next 2 hours and 38 minutes the crew and Mission Control worked to check that the spacecraft was in working in order and ready for Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI), the burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon. At the same time the crew transformed the capsule from a rocket payload to a spacecraft. And the [[S-IVB]] third stage had to be in working order. On the previous unmanned test, the S-IVB had failed to re-ignite. 

During the flight there would be three [[capsule communicator]]s (usually referred to as &quot;capcoms&quot;) on a rotating roster. These were the only people who would normally communicate with the crew. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] was the first of these on duty and at 2 hours, 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch radioed &quot;''Apollo 8''. You are Go for TLI&quot;. Mission Control had given official permission for the crew to go to the moon. Over the next twelve minutes before the burn, the crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the rocket. The [[S-IVB|S-IVB third stage]] rocket ignited on time and burned perfectly for 5 minutes and 17 seconds. The burn increased the velocity of the spacecraft to 35,505 ft/s (10,822 m/s) and their altitude at the end of the burn was 215.4 mi (346.7 km). They were the fastest humans in history.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 go for TLI.ogg|title=Go for TLI|description=Capsule communicator Michael Collins gives the crew of ''Apollo 8'' a 'go' for Trans-Lunar Injection|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Now that the S-IVB had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage, as well as practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft around they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it. This was the first time humans had been able to see the entire Earth in one go. 

Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the CSM and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control at first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters on the Service Module to add 3 ft/s (0.9 m/s) away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After much discussion it was decided to burn in this direction anyway but at 9 ft/s (2.7 m/s). These discussions ended up putting the crew an hour behind their flight plan.

Five hours after launch, mission control commanded the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change its trajectory such that it would flyby the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, so as to pose no future hazard to the crew. It went into a 0.99 by 0.92 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] solar orbit with an [[inclination]] of 23.47¬∞ and a period of 340.80 days.

The members of the ''Apollo 8'' crew were the first humans to pass through the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, which extend up to 15,000 mi (25,000 km) from Earth. Although it was predicted that the passage through the belts would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest [[X-ray]] or 1 [[Gray (unit)|milligray]] (during the course of a year, the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mGy), there was still interest in the radiation dosages on the crew. So each crewmember wore a Personal Radiation [[Dosimeter]] that could be read back to the ground as well as three passive film dosimeters that show the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By the end of the mission, the average radiation dose of the crew was 1.6 mGy.

===Coasting to the Moon===
[[Image:As08-16-2593.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the first images taken by humans of the whole Earth. Probably photographed by [[Bill Anders]]. South is up with [[South America]] in the middle]]
Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was to act as [[navigator]]. Although Mission Control performed all the actual navigation calculation, it was necessary that in case of communication loss the crew could navigate their way home. This was done by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]]. This proved to be difficult, as the venting by the S-IVB had caused a large cloud of debris to form around the spacecraft, making it hard to distinguish what were the actual stars. 

By seven hours into the mission, the delay in moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's star sightings meant that they were behind schedule on the flight plan by about one hour and 40 minutes. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), or what is more aptly called [[barbecue]] mode. This had the spacecraft roll about one rotation per hour, along its long axis in order to ensure even [[heat distribution]] of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over 200 ¬∞C while the parts in shadow would be -100 ¬∞C. These temperatures could cause the [[heat shield]] to crack or propellant lines to burst. As it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft actually swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. This would have to be trimmed every half hour as it started to get larger and larger.

The first mid-course correction came 11 hours into the flight. Testing on the ground had shown there was a small chance that the [[Service Propulsion System]] (SPS) engine would explode when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was 'coated' first. This could be done by burning the engine for a short period. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about 20.4 ft/s (6.2 m/s) [[Prograde and retrograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel). This was less than the 24.8 ft/s (7.5 m/s) planned, and the shortfall was due to a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[redox|oxidizer]] lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure, requiring the crew to use the small Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned midcourse corrections were cancelled as the trajectory was found to be perfect.

Eleven hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for over 16 hours, having been awakened about 5 hours before launch. So it was time for Frank Borman to start his scheduled 7-hour sleep period. It proved difficult to sleep. NASA had decided that at least one crewmember should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise. But the constant radio chatter with the ground and the air circulation fans made it hard to sleep. As well as this, sleeping in space is a somewhat unnatural experience‚Äîyou cannot rest your head on a [[pillow]] and Bill Anders said that he would suddenly jolt awake with the sensation that he was falling. 

[[Image:As8-16-2583.jpg|thumb|250px|''Apollo 8'' [[S-IVB]] rocket stage. (NASA)]]
About an hour after starting his sleep period, Borman requested clearance to take a [[Secobarbitol|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]], but the pill had little effect. After Borman slept for seven hours fitfully, he awoke feeling ill. He [[vomiting|vomited]] twice, and had a bout of [[diarrhea]] that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and [[feces]]. The crew cleaned up as best as they could. Borman decided that he did not want the world to know about his medical problems but Lovell and Anders still wanted to tell the ground. They decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could be used by the crew to [[tape recorder|tape voice recordings]] and telemetry, which were then dumped to the ground at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they requested that mission control check the recording, as the crew ''&quot;would like an evaluation of the voice comments&quot;''. 

A conference between the crew and medical personnel was held using the unoccupied second floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor, of which only one is used during the course of a mission). During a private communication with the crew, it was decided that there was little to worry about and that it was either a [[Gastroenteritis|24-hour flu]] as Borman thought, or just a reaction to the sleeping pill. In fact it is now thought that he was suffering from [[Space Adaptation Syndrome]], which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|vestibular system]] adapts to [[weightlessness]]. It had never arisen on previous spacecraft ([[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]) as they had been too small to move freely in.

[[Image:Ap8-S68-56531.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In-flight footage of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the Moon. In the center is Frank Borman]]
The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, with little happening except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and they were on course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast for 31 hours after launch. The camera used was 2 kg and broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. It had two [[lens (optics)|lens]]es: a very [[wide-angle]] (160¬∞) lens and a [[telephoto]] (9¬∞) lens. 

During this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared. However this proved impossible, as the narrow-angle lens was difficult to aim without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at. Also without proper [[filter (optics)|filter]]s, the image became saturated by any bright source. In the end all the crew could do was show the people watching back on Earth a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17 minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[High Gain Antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother happy birthday.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 Borman describing the Earth.ogg|title=Borman described the Earth|description=Frank Borman describes view of Earth from midway to Moon|format=[[Ogg]]}}

By this time the planned sleep periods had completely been abandoned. 32¬Ω hours into the flight, Lovell went to bed, 3¬Ω hours before he had planned to. A short while later Anders also went to bed after taking a sleeping pill. 

Somewhat strangely the crew were unable to see the [[Moon]] for much of the outward cruise. Three of the five windows had fogged up, due to outgassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and due to the attitude required for the PTC, the Moon was almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft. In fact it was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.

A second television broadcast came at 55 hours. This time the crew had managed to rig up [[filter (optics)|filter]]s meant for the still cameras, so that they could acquire images of the Earth through the [[telephoto]] lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first [[television]] pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors that could be seen. The transmission lasted 23 minutes.

===Lunar sphere of influence===
At about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight, the crew of ''Apollo 8'' became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body. Or to put it another way, the Moon's [[gravitational force]] became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, they were 38,759 mi (62,377 km) from the Moon and had a speed of 3,990 ft/s (1,216 m/s) with respect to the Moon. This historic moment was of little interest to the crew as they still calculated their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and would do so until they performed their last midcourse correction, when they would switch to a [[reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only thirteen hours until they would be in lunar orbit.

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion was a second midcourse correction. It was in [[Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde]] (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by 2.0 ft/s (0.6 m/s), in effect lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon. At exactly 61 hours after launch, about 24,200 mi (39,000 km) from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds. They would now pass 71.7 mi (115.4 km) from the lunar surface.

At 64 hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[Astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a Go/No Go decision, the crew was told at 68 hours, they were Go and ''&quot;riding the best bird we can find&quot;''. At 68 hours and 58 minutes, the spacecraft went behind the Moon and out of radio contact with the Earth.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 prior to LOI.ogg|title=''Apollo 8'' goes behind the Moon|description=The last transmissions from the spacecraft before it goes behind the Moon|format=[[Ogg]]}}

With ten minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. Then they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight [[oblique]]ly illuminating the lunar surface. But the burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view. 

===Lunar orbit===
Igniting at 69 hours, 8 minutes and 16 seconds after launch, the SPS burned for 4 minutes and 13 seconds, placing the crew of ''Apollo 8'' in orbit around the Moon. The crew described this as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the right amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar [[orbit]] or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have ended up impacting the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20 hours.

[[Image:AS8-13-2329.jpg|thumb|250px|The first Earthrise photographed by humans]]
On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However this time came and went without ''Apollo 8'' reappearing. And then exactly at the predicted moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a 193.3 mi by 69.5 mi (311.1 km by 111.9 km) orbit about the Moon.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 first lunar orbit transmissions.ogg|title=''Apollo 8'' appears from behind the Moon|description=First transmissions from ''Apollo 8'' after it has entered into lunar orbit|format=[[Ogg]]}}

After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:

:The Moon is essentially grey, no color; looks like [[plaster of Paris]] or sort of a grayish beach sand. We can see quite a bit of detail. The [[Mare Fecunditatis|Sea of Fertility]] doesn't stand out as well here as it does back on Earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a few of them, some of them are newer. Many of them look like‚Äîespecially the round ones‚Äîlook like hit by [[meteorite]]s or projectiles of some sort. [[Langrenus (crater)|Langrenus]] is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to it. The walls of the crater are terraced, about six or seven different [[wiktionary:terrace|terrace]]s on the way down.

Lovell continued to describe the terrain that they were passing over. One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of the planned landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that would be the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' landing site. The launch time of ''Apollo 8'' had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. And Bill Anders would spend much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as he could of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew would take 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth. 

[[Image:As8-13-2225.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A portion of the lunar near side. The large crater in the bottom half of the photo is [[Goclenius (crater)|Goclenius]].]]
Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with the Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a Go/No Go decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.

As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the television to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the eleven-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to 70.0 mi by 71.3 mi (112.6 km by 114.8 km).

Over the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small [[prayer]] for his [[church]], as he was meant to lay read during the [[Midnight service]] at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Church near [[Seabrook, Texas]] but due to the Apollo 8 flight was unable. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.

It was as the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front that the crew witnessed an event never before seen‚ÄîEarthrise. Anders glanced out the window and saw a blue and white orb and realized it was the [[Earth]]. Instantly the crew understood that they needed to take a photograph of this. Anders took both the first photograph, which was black-and-white, and then later the more famous color photo. (After the flight, Borman and Anders both claimed they took the first earthrise photo (Lovell also did, but more as a joke than anything else) - it was determined that it was probably Anders.)

[[Image:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|250px|Earth as seen from ''Apollo 8'', December 24, 1968 (NASA)]]
Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell took the controls of the spacecraft so that Borman could get some rest. As always resting was difficult in the cramped and noisy capsule, though Borman was able to [[doze]] for two orbits. He would awaken at times to ask a question about their status, only to be told that everything was going fine. 

Borman did wake up however when he started to hear his fellow crewmembers make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night's sleep in over three days. Taking command, he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as the commander would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted to crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm.

As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being ''&quot;a vast, lonely, forbidding type of existence or expanse of nothing&quot;''. And then after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth.

Borman closes with: &quot;And from the crew of ''Apollo 8'', we close with, Good night, Good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The only thing left for the crew now was to perform the Trans-Earth Injection or TEI, which would occur 2¬Ω hours after the end of the television transmission. This was the most critical burn of the whole flight. If the SPS failed to ignite, then the crew would be stuck in orbit around the Moon, with only about 5 more days of oxygen and no chance of escape. And once again the burn had to be performed while the crew was out of contact with Earth, on the far side of the Moon. 

The burn occurred perfectly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89 hours, 28 minutes, and 39 seconds, the exact time predicted. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, &quot;Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]]&quot;, to which [[Ken Mattingly]], the capcom, replied, &quot;That's affirmative, You are the best ones to know&quot;. It was [[Christmas Day]], 1968.

[[Image:AS8-13-2344.jpg|thumb|250px|Rupes Cauchy in eastern Mare Tranquillitatis]]

===Unplanned manual re-alignment===
Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard. However, an accidental entry erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the inertial measuring unit (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to &quot;correct&quot; the module's attitude.

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars [[Rigel]] and [[Sirius]] aligned, and another fifteen minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.

Sixteen months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the ''[[Apollo 13]]'' mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, ''Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13'' (later re-titled ''Apollo 13'' when the movie based on it, ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' came out), Lovell wrote, &quot;My training [on Apollo 8] came in handy!&quot; In that book he dismissed the incident as a 'planned experiment', requested by the ground crew. However, in subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake, as described in [[Robert Zimmerman (author)|Robert Zimmerman]]'s 1998 book ''Genesis: The Story of Apollo 8''.

===Cruise back to Earth and re-entry===
The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter 2¬Ω days after TEI and [[splashdown]] in the Pacific. 

On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth and final television broadcast. This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space. When they had finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker‚Äîreal [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] with [[stuffing]] and three miniature bottles of [[brandy]] (which remained unopened). There were also small presents to the crew from their wives.

[[Image:Ap8-S68-56310.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Apollo 8'' Command Module on the deck of the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']].]]
After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry. The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward. If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.

After separating from the Service Module, all the crew could do was sit and wait. Six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists. As they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing [[Plasma physics|plasma]] formed around the capsule. The capsule started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 g (59 m/s&amp;sup2;). With the computer controlling the descent by changing the [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]] of the capsule, ''Apollo 8'' rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean. At 30,000 feet (9 km) the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at 10,000 feet (3 km) by the three main parachutes. The spacecraft splashdown position was estimated to be {{coor dm|8|6|N|165|1|W|}}.

When it hit the water, the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down, in what was termed Stable 2 position. As they were buffeted by a 10-foot (3 m) swell, Borman was sick, waiting for the three floatation balloons to right the capsule. It was 43 minutes after splashdown before the first [[frogman]] from the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']] arrived, as the capsule had landed before sunrise. Forty-five minutes later they were on the deck of the aircraft carrier. 

The command module is now displayed at the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] [[Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago|Museum of Science and Industry]], along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by Lovell and Frank Borman's spacesuit. Jim Lovell's spacesuit can be found at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]].

==Historical importance==
''Apollo 8'' came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval around the world. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tanks had put a stop to the [[Prague Spring]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] had been assassinated; the [[Vietnam War]] had escalated with the [[Tet Offensive]]; University campuses across the [[United States]] had seen rioting and occupation of buildings by students; [[May 1968|May]] had seen rioting in [[Paris]] that almost led to revolution.

Yet over all these other events, [[TIME|TIME magazine]] chose the crew of ''Apollo 8'' as their [[Person of the Year|Men of the Year]] for 1968, recognizing them as the people that most influenced events in the preceding year. They had been the first people to ever leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body. They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of ''Apollo 8'' can be summed up by a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that simply stated, &quot;Thank you ''Apollo 8''. You saved 1968.&quot;

One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the Earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon. Although it was not the first image taken of the whole Earth nor would it be the last, this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture. Some regard the picture as being the start of the [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] movement, with the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.[http://ipp.nasa.gov/innovation/Innovation_84/wnewview.html]

The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, [[Mercury Atlas 6]] by [[John Glenn]] in 1962. There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the [[BBC]] coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages. The Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' even covered the flight without the usual anti-American editorializing. It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw ‚Äî either live or delayed ‚Äî the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon; it had a tremendous impact. Touring the world after the mission, Borman met with [[Pope Paul VI]]; he was told &quot;I have spent my entire life trying to say to the world what you did on Christmas Eve.&quot;

The militant [[atheist]] [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from ''Genesis''; she wished the courts to ban US astronauts‚Äîwho were all Government employees‚Äîfrom public prayer in space. This was eventually rejected by the courts, but it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program. [[Buzz Aldrin]], on ''[[Apollo 11]]'', took [[Eucharist|communion]] on the surface of the moon after landing; he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years, and only obliquely referred to it at the time.

==Crew==
*[[Frank Borman]] (flew on ''[[Gemini 7]]'' &amp; ''Apollo 8''), commander
*[[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] (flew on ''[[Gemini 7]]'', ''[[Gemini 12]]'', ''Apollo 8'' &amp; ''[[Apollo 13]]''), command module pilot
*[[William Anders]] (flew on ''Apollo 8''), lunar module pilot

As a note, astronaut [[Michael Collins]], who flew aboard the [[Gemini 10]] mission, was originally slated to fly aboard Apollo 8 as Command Module pilot.  A [[bone spur]] in his neck that required surgery grounded Collins, requiring Jim Lovell to fly in Collins' place.  In early 1969, Collins was reinstated to active flight status, and replaced Fred Haise on the Apollo 11 prime crew as Command Module pilot, while Edwin Aldrin became lunar module pilot.  Haise became the backup LM pilot for Apollo 11.

===Backup crew===
The backup crew trained to take the place of the prime crew in case of illness or death.
*[[Neil Armstrong]], (flew on ''[[Gemini 8]]'', ''[[Apollo 11]]''), commander
*[[Edwin E. Aldrin]], (flew on ''[[Gemini 12]]'', ''[[Apollo 11]]''), command module pilot
*[[Fred Haise]], (flew on ''[[Apollo 13]]''), lunar module pilot

===Support crew===
The support crew were not trained to fly the mission but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They often also served as capcoms during the mission.
*[[John S. Bull|John Bull]] (never flew in space)
*[[Vance Brand]] (flew on ''[[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]'', ''[[STS-5]]'', ''[[STS-41-B]]'', ''[[STS-35]]''
*[[Gerald Carr]] (flew on ''[[Skylab 4]]'')
*[[Ken Mattingly]] (flew on ''[[Apollo 16]]'', ''[[STS-4]]'', ''[[STS-51-C]]'')

An '''astronaut''', '''cosmonaut''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞ÃÅ–≤—Ç), '''spationaut''' or '''taikonaut''' (''taikongren'', Â§™Á©∫‰∫∫) is a person who [[space travel|travels into space]], or who makes a career of doing so. The criteria for determining who has achieved [[human spaceflight]] vary (see [[edge of space]]). In the [[United States]], people who travel above an altitude of 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) are designated as astronauts. The [[F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale|FAI]] defines spaceflight as over 100 km (61 miles). As of [[October 12]], [[As of 2005|2005]], a total of 448 humans have reached space according to the U.S. definition, 442 people qualify under the FAI definition, while 438 people have reached [[Earth]] orbit or beyond. These individuals have spent over 28,000 crew-days (or a cumulative total of 76.7 years) in space including over 100 crew-days of spacewalks. A person who has traveled in space is said to hold [[astronaut wings]]. Astronauts from at least [[Timeline of astronauts by nationality|34 countries]] have gone into space.

==International variations==
By convention, a space traveller employed by the [[Russian Aviation and Space Agency]] or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor is called a '''cosmonaut'''. &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Russia]]n word –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç ''(kosmonavt)'', which in turn derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''kosmos'' (&quot;universe&quot;) and ''nautes'' (&quot;sailor&quot;).

In the [[United States|USA]], a space traveller is called an '''astronaut'''. The term derives from the Greek words ''√°stron'' (&quot;star&quot;) and ''nautes,'' (&quot;sailor&quot;). For the most part, &quot;cosmonaut&quot; and &quot;astronaut&quot; are synonyms in all languages, and the usage of choice is often dictated by  political reasons.  However in the United States, the term &quot;astronaut&quot; is typically applied to the individual as soon as training begins, while in Russia, an individual is not labeled a cosmonaut until successful space flight. The first known use of the term was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story ''The Death's Head Meteor'' in [[1930]]. On [[March 14]], [[1995]] astronaut [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, arguably becoming the first American cosmonaut in the process.

[[Europe]]an (outside of the [[UK]]) space travellers are sometimes, especially in [[French language|French]]-speaking countries, called '''spationauts''' (a [[hybrid word]] formed from the [[Latin]] ''spatium'', &quot;space&quot;, and Greek ''nautes'', &quot;sailor&quot;). Apart from the Soviet Union, Europe has not yet produced manned spacecraft, but has sent men and women into space in cooperation with Russia and the United States.

'''Taikonaut''' is sometimes used in English for astronauts from [[China]] by Western news media. The term was coined in May 1998 by Chiew Lee Yih (ËµµÈáåÊò±) from [[Malaysia]], who used it first in [[newsgroup]]s. Almost simultaneously, Chen Lan coined it for use in the Western [[mass media|media]] based on the term ''t√†ik≈çng'' (Â§™Á©∫, literally &quot;great emptiness&quot;), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] for &quot;[[outer space|space]]&quot;. In Chinese itself, however, a single term ''y«îh√°ng yu√°n'' (ÂÆáËà™Âëò, &quot;universe navigator&quot;) has long been used for astronauts. The closest term using ''taikong'' is a [[colloquialism]] ''t√†ik≈çng r√©n'' (Â§™Á©∫‰∫∫, &quot;space person&quot;), which refers to people who have actually been in space. Official English texts issued by the Chinese government use ''astronaut'' ({{zh-sp|s=Ëà™Â§©Âëò|p=h√°ngtiƒÅn yu√°n}}).

==Space milestones==
[[Image:GagarinPortrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Yuri Gagarin]] ]]
[[Image:Tereshkova.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Valentina Tereshkova]] ]]

The first attempt ever in human history to use rocket for a spaceflight was done in the [[16th century]] by a Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] official, a skilled stargazer named [[Wan Hu]].&lt;sup&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/09/30/china.wanhu/index.html]&lt;/sup&gt; This attempt was not successful.

The first cosmonaut was [[Yuri Gagarin]], who was launched into space on [[April 12]] [[1961]] aboard [[Vostok 1]]. The first woman cosmonaut was [[Valentina Tereshkova]], launched into space in June [[1963]] aboard [[Vostok 6]]. [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American in space in May 1961. [[Vladimir Remek]] became the first non-Soviet European in space in [[1978]] on a Russian [[Soyuz launch vehicle|Soyuz]] rocket. On [[July 23]] [[1980]] [[Pham Tuan]] of Vietnam became the first [[Asian]] in space when he flew aboard [[Soyuz 37]]. Also in 1980, [[Arnaldo Tamayo M√©ndez]] became the first person of [[African]] descent to fly in space. (The first person born in Africa to fly in space was [[Patrick Baudry]].) In June [[1985]] [[Shannon Lucid]] became the first Chinese born person in space. In [[2002]] [[Mark Shuttleworth]] became the first citizen of an African country to fly in space. On [[15 October]] [[2003]] [[Yang Liwei]] became China's first astronaut on the [[Shenzhou 5]] spacecraft. The first mission to orbit the moon was ''[[Apollo 8]]'' which included [[William Anders]] - who was born in Hong Kong making him the first Asian-born astronaut in [[1968]].

The youngest person to fly in space is [[Gherman Titov]], who was roughly 26 years old when he flew [[Vostok 2]], and the oldest is [[John Glenn]] who was 77 when he flew on [[STS-95]]. The longest stay in space was 438 days by [[Valeri Polyakov]]. [[As of 2005]], the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut was seven, a record held by both [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Franklin Chang-Diaz]]. The furthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was 401&amp;nbsp;056&amp;nbsp;km (during the [[Apollo 13]] emergency).

The first non-governmental astronaut was [[Byron K. Lichtenberg]], an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] researcher who flew on [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-9]] in 1983. In [[December 1990]], [[Toyohiro Akiyama]] became the first commercial space‚Äêfarer as a reporter for [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] who paid for his flight. The first self‚Äêfunded [[space tourist]] was [[Dennis Tito]] on [[28 April]] [[2001]], while the first astronaut to fly on an entirely privately-funded mission was [[Mike Melvill]], on [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P]], though this flight was sub‚Äêorbital.

In the United States, persons selected as astronaut candidates receive silver [[Astronaut wings]]. Once they have flown in space they receive gold Astronaut wings. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents Astronaut wings to its pilots who exceed 50 miles (80¬†km) in altitude.

== International astronauts ==
[[Image:ZeroG.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Astronauts on the International Space Station. British astronaut [[Michael Foale]] can be seen exercising in the foreground]]

Up until the end of the [[1970s]] only Americans and Soviets were active astronauts. In [[1976]] the Soviets started the [[Intercosmos]] program with a first group of 6 cosmonauts from fellow [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and [[Cuba]], a second group started training in [[1978]]. At about the same time in [[1978]] the [[European Space Agency]] selected 4 astronauts to train for the first [[Spacelab]] mission on board of the [[Space Shuttle]]. In [[1980]] [[France]] started their own selection of astronauts, followed in [[1982]] by [[Germany]], in [[1983]] by the [[Canadian space program]], in [[1985]] by [[Japan]] and [[Italy]] in [[1988]]. Several international payload specialists were selected for the Space Shuttle, and also later for international [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] missions of Russia. In [[1998]] the [[European Space Agency]] formed a single astronaut corps of 18 by dissolving the former national corps of France, Germany and Italy. The [[United Kingdom]] does not contribute to ESA's [[human spaceflight]] programme and so its citizens must receive training from either the United States or Russia if they wish to become astronauts.

== Astronaut training==

The first astronauts, both in the USA and USSR, tended to be jet fighter pilots, often [[test pilot|test pilots]], from military backgrounds. U.S. military astronauts receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]] upon completion of Astronaut training and participation in a space flight.

== Astronaut deaths ==
[[Image:DickScobee.jpeg|frame|[[Dick Scobee]], commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger during the [[STS-51-L]] mission. ]]
To date, eighteen astronauts have been killed on space missions, and at least ten more have been killed in ground-based training accidents. ''See also: [[space disaster]].''

==Trivia==
Many people who claim the [[Apollo moon landing hoax accusations|Apollo moon landings were faked]] often call the astronauts ''astroNOTs''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''A Modest Proposal: For Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland from Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick''''', commonly referred to as '''''A Modest Proposal''''', is a [[satire|satirical]] [[pamphlet]] written by [[Jonathan Swift]] in [[1729]]. The work has now become one of the epitomes of satire, and the modern phrase &quot;A modest proposal&quot; derives from the work.

==Theme==

The work is written in [[first person]] [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]; however, the narrator should not be confused with Swift himself, because the writer is merely a [[persona]]. He argues, through economic reasoning as well as a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn the problem of squalor among the [[Catholic]]s in [[Ireland]] into its own solution. His proposal is to fatten up the undernourished children and feed them to [[Ireland]]'s rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one thus combating [[overpopulation]] and [[unemployment]], sparing families the expense of child-rearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.

He offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed.

This is widely believed to be the greatest example of sustained [[irony]] in the history of the English language.

==Reactions==
The satirical intent of ''A Modest Proposal'' was misunderstood by many of Swift's peers, and he was harshly criticized for writing prose in such exceptionally &quot;[[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]]&quot;. He came close to losing his [[patronage]] because of this essay. The misunderstanding of the intent of the satirical attack came about largely because of the disparity between the satirical intent of the [[cannibal|cannibalistic]] proposal and the sincere tone of the narrative voice.

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, the phrase &quot;modest proposal&quot; has come to indicate a proposal that is anything but modest.  Such a 'proposal' may serve to advance a cause or [[Logical argument|argument]], by promoting discussion on the merits of the argument's opposite.

==Other examples of &quot;modest proposals&quot;==

*[[Report From Iron Mountain]]
*[[Sokal Affair]]
*[[Miscegenation]] (origin of the word)
*[[Dihydrogen monoxide]]
*[[Jack Thompson]], attorney, has been criticised for writing an open letter similar to Swift's piece, one that included a promise of donating money to charity.

The '''alkali metals''' are the [[chemical series|series]] of [[chemical element|elements]] in [[Periodic table group|Group 1]] ([[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] style) of the [[periodic table]] (excluding [[hydrogen]] in all but one [[Metallic_hydrogen|rare circumstance]]): [[lithium]] ('''Li'''), [[sodium]] ('''Na'''), [[potassium]] ('''K'''), [[rubidium]] ('''Rb'''), [[caesium]] ('''Cs'''), and [[francium]] ('''Fr'''). They are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental form in nature.

The alkali metals are silver-colored (caesium has a golden tinge), soft, low-[[density]] [[metal]]s, which react readily with [[halogen]]s to form [[ionic salt]]s, and with [[water (molecule)|water]] to form strongly [[alkali|alkaline]] [[Base (chemistry)|(basic)]] [[hydroxide]]s. These elements all have one [[electron]] in their outermost shell, so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled [[electron shell]] is to lose one electron to form a singly [[electric charge|charged]] positive [[ion]].  

[[Hydrogen]], with a solitary electron, is sometimes placed at the top of Group 1, but it is not an alkali metal (except under extreme circumstances as [[metallic hydrogen]]); rather it exists naturally as a diatomic [[gas]]. Removal of its single electron requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron for the alkali metals.  As in the [[halogen]]s, only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen, forming the negative [[hydride]] ion. Binary compounds of hydride with the alkali metals and some [[transition metal]]s have been prepared.

Under extremely high [[pressure]], such as is found at the core of [[Jupiter]], hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; see [[metallic hydrogen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[logic]], the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of an [[logical argument|argument]] results from replacing the different words, or sentences, that make up the argument with letters, along the lines of [[algebra]]; the letters represent logical ''[[variable]]s''. The ''sentence forms'' which classify argument forms of common arguments important are studied in [[college logic]].

Here is an example of an argument:

'''A''' All humans are mortal.  Socrates is human.  ''Therefore'', Socrates is mortal.

We can rewrite argument A by putting each sentence on its own line:

'''B'''
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:''Therefore'', Socrates is mortal.

To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout '''B''':

'''C'''
:All S are P.
:''a'' is S.
:''Therefore'', ''a'' is P.

All we have done in '''C''' is to put 'S' for 'human' and 'humans', 'P' for 'mortal', and '''a''' for 'Socrates'; what results, '''C''', is the ''form'' of the original argument in '''A'''.  So argument form '''C''' is the form of argument '''A'''.  Moreover, each individual sentence of '''C''' is the ''sentence'' ''form'' of its respective sentence in '''A'''.

Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[validity|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. Some examples of valid arguments forms are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and the [[disjunctive syllogism]]. Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]].

An '''alphabet''' is a complete standardized set of ''letters'' &amp;mdash; basic written symbols &amp;mdash; each of which roughly represents a [[phoneme]] of a spoken [[language]], either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past.  There are other [[writing system|systems of writing]] such as [[logogram]]s, in which each symbol represents a [[morpheme]], or word, and [[syllabary|syllabaries]], in which each symbol represents a syllable.

The word &quot;alphabet&quot; itself comes from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] and [[beta (letter)|beta]], the first two symbols of the [[Greek alphabet]].  There are dozens of alphabets in use today.  Most of them are '[[linear writing|linear]]', which means that they are made up of lines.  Notable [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] are the [[Braille|Braille alphabet]], [[Morse code]] and the [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] alphabet of the ancient city of [[Ugarit]].
{{alphabet}}
==Types==

The term &quot;alphabet&quot; is currently used by linguists both in a wider and in a narrower sense. In the wider sense, the term refers to any script that is segmental on the [[phoneme]] level, i.e. that has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish true &quot;alphabets&quot; from two other subtypes, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. The three types differ from each other in the way vowels are treated in relation to consonants. Abjads record only consonants and leave vowels (or most vowels) unexpressed; in Abugidas the vowels are indicated by diacritical marks or systematic modification of the form of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, both consonants and vowels have separate symbols. The first alphabet in the wider sense was the [[Proto-Canaanite alphabet]], an [[abjad]], which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] became the ancestor of all later alphabets. The first alphabet in the narrow sense was the [[Greek alphabet]].

Examples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic]], and Korean [[Hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary, as a glyph stands for a consonant and is rotated to represent the vowel, rather than each consonant-vowel combination being represented by a separate glyph, as in a true syllabary. 

The boundaries between these three types are not always clear-cut. For example, Iraqi [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa]] script of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Amharic_language#Amharic_Abugida_Symbols_.28.22Fidel.22_.E1.8D.8A.E1.8B.B0.E1.88.8D.29|Amharic abugida]] have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the system is learned as a [[syllabary]] rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)

Thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on the treatment of tone, though there are as yet no names to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]] (an abugida), vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates the tone.  More rarely, a script has separate letters for the tones, as is the case for [[Hmong pronunciation|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]]. For many of these languages, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas. 

Alphabets can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[Okina| ªokina]] and five long vowels.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated'', that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g, d, y, k,'' and ''j''. However, such simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but had to be learned as word symbols &amp;ndash; that is, as [[logogram]]s like Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]].

The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''k≈°'' and ''j√±'', though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added to represent sounds from Persian and English). 

The largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest true alphabets include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abxaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin alphabet]]), with 46. However, these scripts either include di- and tri-graphs, similar to Spanish ''ch'', or [[diacritic]]s, like Slovak ''ƒç''. The largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], with 41 letters. 

Syllabaries typically include 50 to 400 glyphs (though the [[M√∫ra-Pirah√£ language]] of [[Brazil]] would require only 24 if tone were not indicated, and Rotokas 30), and the glyphs of logographic systems number from the hundreds to the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

It is not always clear what constitutes a distinct alphabet.  [[French language|French]] uses the same basic alphabet as English, but many of the letters can carry [[diacritic]] and other marks (for example, √©, √† or √¥). In French, these marks are not considered to create additional letters.  However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters (such as √°, √≠ and √∂) are considered distinct letters of the alphabet.  Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[√¶]] in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Ou (letter)|&amp;#546;]] in [[Algonquian language|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] √æ in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] √∞ of Old English and Icelandic, which came from ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, or [[Italian language|Italian]], which only uses the letters ''j'', ''k'', ''x'', ''y'' and ''w'' for foreign words.

==Spelling==
{{details|Spelling}}

Each language may establish certain general rules that govern the association between letters and phonemes, but, depending on the language, these rules may or may not be consistently followed.  In a perfectly [[phonology| phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions:  a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.  However, languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:

* A language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] uses a tesseragraph (four letters) for one of its phonemes.
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters.
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence.
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items (such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard.  However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes.  The [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never needed: each phoneme of Standard Italian is represented in only one way. However, pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling because certain letters are pronounced in more than one way. In standard Spanish, it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa; this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.  At the other extreme, however, are languages such as English and [[Irish language|Irish]], where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way. For English, this is because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels.  However, even English has general rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

==Collation==
{{details|Collation}}

An alphabet also serves to establish an ''order'' among letters that can be used for sorting entries in lists, called collating. Note that the order does not have to be constant among different languages using this alphabet; for examples see [[Latin alphabet#Collating in other languages|Latin alphabet: Collating in other languages]].

In recent years the [[Unicode]] initiative has attempted to collate most of the world's known writing systems into a single [[character encoding]]. As well as its primary purpose of standardising computer processing of non-Roman scripts, the Unicode project has provided a focus for script-related scholarship.

==The Alphabet effect==

Some communication theorists (notably those associated with the so-called &quot;Toronto school of communications&quot;, such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]] and more recently [[Robert K. Logan]]) have advanced hypotheses to the effect that alphabetic scripts in particular have served to promote and encourage the skills of analysis, coding, decoding, and classification. This set of hypotheses may be known as &quot;the Alphabet effect&quot;, after the title of Logan's [[1986]] work. 

The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed in some way to the development of the societies which use it. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of alphabetic (as distinct to other types of) writing systems has made a significant impact on &quot;Western&quot; thinking and development because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) postulates that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of codified law, monotheism, abstract science, deductive logic, objective history, and individualism. According to Logan, &quot;All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the Tigris-Euphrates river system and the Aegean Sea, and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C.&quot; (Logan 2004). 

However, many of these abstractions first occurred in societies which did not use an alphabet, such as the codified law of [[Hammurabi]] in [[Babylonia]], which predated similar codes in societies with the alphabet. Since the alphabet quickly spread to become nearly ubiquitous, it is difficult to trace cause and effect in this matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], the '''atomic number''' ('''Z''') is the number of [[proton]]s found in the nucleus of an [[atom]]. In an atom of [[neutral|neutral charge]], the number of [[electrons]] ''also'' equals the atomic number.

The atomic number originally meant the number of an element's place in the [[periodic table]]. When [[Dmitriy Mendeleyev|Mendeleyev]] arranged the known [[chemical element]]s grouped by their similarities in chemistry, it was noticeable that placing them in strict order of [[atomic weight|atomic mass]] resulted in some mismatches. [[Iodine]] and [[tellurium]], if listed by atomic mass, appeared to be in the wrong order, and would fit better if their places in the table were swapped. Placing them in the order which fit chemical properties most closely, their number in the table was their atomic number. This number appeared to be approximately proportional to the mass of the atom, but, as the discrepancy showed, reflected some other property than mass. 

The anomalies in this sequence were finally explained after research by [[Henry Moseley|Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley]] in [[1913]]. Moseley discovered a strict relationship between the [[x-ray diffraction]] spectra of elements, and their correct location in the periodic table. It was later shown that the atomic number corresponds to the [[electric charge]] of the nucleus &amp;mdash; in other words the number of protons. It is the charge which gives elements their chemical properties, rather than the atomic mass.

The atomic number is closely related to the [[mass number]] (although they should not be confused) which is the number of protons and [[neutron|neutrons]] in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number often comes after the name of the element, e.g. [[carbon-14]] (used in [[carbon dating]]).

'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒºŒØŒ±}} anatomia'', from '' {{polytonic|·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÑŒ≠ŒºŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ}} anatemnein'', to cut up, cut open), is the branch of [[biology]] that deals with the structure and organization of living things. It can be divided into animal anatomy ([[zootomy]]) and plant anatomy ([[phytonomy]]).  Furthermore, anatomy can be covered either regionally or systemically, that is, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest for the former, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systmes for the latter. Major branches of anatomy include [[comparative anatomy]], [[histology]], and [[human anatomy]]. 

==Animal anatomy==
Animal anatomy may include the study of the structure of different animals, when it is called [[comparative anatomy]] or [[animal morphology]], or it may be limited to one animal only, in which case it is spoken of as ''special anatomy''.

==Human anatomy==
From a utilitarian point of view the study of [[human]]s is the most important division of special anatomy, and this human anatomy may be approached from different points of view. 

From that of Medicine it consists of a knowledge of the exact form, position, size and relationship of the various structures of the healthy human body, and to this study the term descriptive or topographical human anatomy is given, though it is often, less happily, spoken of as ''anthropotomy''.

So intricate is the [[human body]] that only a small number of professional human anatomists, after years of patient observation, are complete masters of all its details; most of them specialize on certain parts, such as the brain or viscera, contenting themselves with a good working knowledge of the rest.

''Topographical anatomy'' must be learned by repeated dissection and inspection of dead human bodies.  
It is no more a [[science]] than a pilot's knowledge is, and, like that knowledge, must be exact and available in moments of emergency. 

From the morphological point of view, however, human anatomy is a scientific and fascinating study, having for its object the discovery of the [[morphogenesis|causes]] which have brought about the existing structure of humans, and needing a knowledge of the allied sciences of [[embryology]] or [[developmental biology]], [[phylogeny]], and [[histology]]. 

''[[Anatomical pathology|Pathological anatomy]]'' (or ''morbid anatomy'') is the study of [[disease]]d [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, while sections of normal anatomy, applied to various purposes, receive special names such as medical, surgical, gynaecological, artistic and superficial anatomy.  
The comparison of the anatomy of different [[race]]s of humans is part of the science of physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy.  
In the present edition of this work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than topographically.  
Each anatomical article contains first a description of the structures of an organ or system (such as [[nerve]]s, [[Artery|arteries]], [[heart]], and so forth), as it is found in humans; this is followed by an account of the development (embryology) and comparative anatomy (morphology), as far as [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]] are concerned; but only those parts of the lower animals which are of interest in explaining human body structure are here dealt with.  
The articles have a twofold purpose; first, to give enough details of structure to make the articles on physiology, surgery, medicine and pathology intelligible; and, secondly, to give the non-expert inquirer, or the worker in some other branch of science, the chief theories on which the modern scientific groundwork of anatomy is built.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Affirming the consequent''' is a [[logical fallacy]] in the form of a hypothetical proposition.  Propositionally speaking, Affirming the Consequent is the logical equivalent of assuming the converse of a statement to be true.  The fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when a hypothetical proposition comprising an [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a [[consequent]] asserts that the truthhood of the consequent implies the truthhood of the antecedent.  This is fallacious because it assumes a bidirectionality when it does not necessarily exist.

This fallacy has the following [[argument form]]:
:If P, then Q.
:Q.
:Therefore, P.

This logical error is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent because it is mistakenly concluded from the second premise that the affirmation of the consequent entails the truthhood of the antecedent. One way to demonstrate the invalidity is to use a counterexample. Here is an argument that is obviously incorrect:

:If [[Stephen King]] wrote the [[Bible]] (P), then Stephen King is a good writer (Q).
:Stephen King is a good writer (Q).
:Therefore, Stephen King wrote the Bible (P).

The previous argument was obviously incorrect, but the next argument may be more deceiving:

:If someone is human (P), then she is mortal (Q).
:Anna is mortal (Q).
:Therefore Anna is human (P).

But in fact Anna can be a cat; very much a mortal, but not a human one.

However, be aware that a similar [[argument form]] is [[validity|valid]] in which the first premise asserts &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; rather than &quot;if&quot;.  Similarly, the converse of a statement can be validly assumed to be true so long as the &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; phrase is attached.

'''Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky''' (–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µÃÅ–π –ê—Ä—Å–µÃÅ–Ω—å–µ–≤–∏—á –¢–∞—Ä–∫–æÃÅ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π) ([[April 4]], [[1932]] - [[December 28]], [[1986]]) was a [[Russia]]n movie director, writer, and actor. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era in Russia and one of the greatest in the [[history of film|history of cinema]]. 

==Biography==
Tarkovsky, son of the prominent poet [[Arseniy Tarkovsky]], was a product of the golden era of Soviet arts education. He received a classical education in [[Moscow]], studying [[Music]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], before training for over five years at the [[VGIK]] film school, studying directly under [[Mikhail Romm]] among others. 
He also worked as a geologist in Siberia.
Although the [[Orthodox Christian]] symbolism of his films led to prevarication and occasional suppression of the finished product by the Soviet authorities, the Soviet [[Mosfilm]] studio system enabled him to make films that would not have been commercially viable in the West. However, Tarkovsky's principal complaint about his treatment by the authorities was that he had many more ideas in him than he was allowed to bring to the screen, and in [[1984]], after shooting ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in [[Italy]], he decided not to return to Russia. He made only one more film, ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', a European co-production filmed in [[Sweden]], before dying of [[cancer]] in the suburb of [[Paris]] at the early age of 54.

Andrei Tarkovsky was buried in a graveyard for Russian √©migr√©s in the town of [[Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois]], [[√éle-de-France (r√©gion)|√éle-de-France]], [[France]].

==Work==
Tarkovsky's films are characterised by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely long takes, and memorable images of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs in his films are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera.

Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot;sculpting in time&quot;. By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time. (The speedy jump-cutting style that is prevalent in MTV videos and Hollywood movies, by contrast, overrides any sense of time by imposing the editor's viewpoint.) By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.

Up to and including his film [[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]], Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After Mirror, he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day. [[The Sacrifice]] is the only film that truly reflects this ambition; it is also considered by many to be a near-perfect reflection of the sculpting in time theory.

==Filmography==
* ''[[The Killers (1958 film)|The Killers]]'' (1958) - Tarkovsky's first student film at VGIK, the Soviet State Film School.
* ''[[Concentrate (1958 film)|Concentrate]]'' (1958) - Tarkovsky's second student film at VGIK, the Soviet State Film School.
* ''[[There Will be No Leave Today]]'' (1959) - Tarkovsky's final student film at VGIK, the Soviet State Film School.
* ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'' (1960) - Tarkovsky's graduation film from VGIK, the Soviet State Film School, cowritten with [[Andrei Konchalovsky]].
* ''[[My Name is Ivan]] / [[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962) - Winner of Golden Lion for &quot;Best Film&quot; at [[1962]] [[Venice Film Festival]].  Set in the Second World War, this is Tarkovsky's most conventional feature film, although it still has moments of lyrical beauty.
* ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966) - An epic based on the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the most famous medieval Russian painter of icons.
* ''[[Solaris (film)|Solaris]]'' (1972) - based on the [[science fiction]] [[Solaris (novel)|novel]] by [[Stanis≈Çaw Lem]]. 
* ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' (1975) - A loosely autobiographical reconstruction of key scenes in Tarkovsky's life, the film he'd tried to make earlier but abandoned for ''Solaris'' (we can note thematic ties between them). Said by Tarkovsky to be closest to his own vision of cinema.
* ''[[Stalker (film)|Stalker]]'' (1979) - inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky]].
* ''[[Tempo di Viaggio/Italian Journey]]'' (1982) - a documentary made for Italian television while scouting locations for [[Nostalghia]] with Italian co-writer (and frequent screenwriter for [[Antonioni |Michelangelo Antonioni]]) [http://imdb.com/name/nm0346096/ Tonino Guerra].
* ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983) - A Russian scholar retraces the footsteps of an 18th century Russian composer in Italy.  An encounter with a local lunatic - a man who believes he can save humanity by carrying a lit candle across an empty swimming pool - crystalizes the poet's melancholic sense of longing for his family, faith, and homeland.
* ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' (1986) - The film is about the prospect of nuclear annihilation and man's spiritual response to this and other dilemmas set in counterpoint to a minor fable of failed adultery.

&quot;This word has many meanings...&quot; D√≥nal Troddyn, A Treatise on Language Vol. 2, 2004

A word, phrase, sentence, or other communication is called '''ambiguous''' if it can be interpreted in more than one way. Ambiguity is distinct from ''[[vagueness]]'', which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct.

'''Lexical ambiguity''' arises when context is insufficient to determine the sense of a single word that has more than one meaning. For example, the word &quot;bank&quot; has several meanings, including &quot;financial institution&quot; and &quot;edge of a river&quot;, but if someone says &quot;I deposited $100 in the bank&quot;, the intended meaning is clear. More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. &quot;Good&quot;, for example, can mean &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; (''That's a good hammer''), &quot;exemplary&quot; (''She's a good student''), &quot;pleasing&quot; (''This is good soup''), &quot;moral&quot; (''He is a good person''), and probably other similar things. &quot;I have a good daughter&quot; isn't clear about which sense is intended.

'''[[Syntactic ambiguity]]''' arises when a sentence can be [[parsing|parsed]] in more than one way. &quot;He ate the cookies on the couch&quot;, for example, could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies. Spoken language can also contain lexical ambiguities, where there is more than one way to break up a set of sounds into words, for example &quot;ice cream&quot; and &quot;I scream&quot;. This is rarely a problem due to the use of context.

[[Philosopher]]s (and other users of [[logic]]) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing ambiguity in arguments, because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments.  For example, a politician might say &quot;I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth&quot;. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth; others will think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth (although in writing, the correct insertion or omission of a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] after &quot;taxes&quot; removes ambiguity here). The politician hopes that each will interpret the statement in the way he wants, and both will think the politician is on his side. The logical fallacies of [[amphiboly]] and [[equivocation]] also rely on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[literature]] and [[rhetoric]], on the other hand, ambiguity can be a useful tool. [[Groucho Marx]]'s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its [[humor]], for example: ''Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. What he was doing in my pajamas I'll never know.''  Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title &quot;Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; (where &quot;blue&quot; can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In narrative, ambiguty can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel [[The Great Gatsby]].           

In [[music]] pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote Sir [[Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.195), &quot;Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.&quot;

Some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially syntactic ambiguity. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two nearly identical languages which have been created with the intention of being clear and impossible to misunderstand. The languages can be both spoken and written. Their unambiguity makes them better suited than natural languages for use in communication between humans and computers.

The '''Aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]]. The name comes from the [[Afrikaans]]/[[Dutch language|Dutch]] for &quot;earth pig&quot; (''aarde'' earth, ''varken'' pig), because early settlers from [[Europe]] thought it resembled a [[pig]] (although Aardvarks are not closely related to pigs).

The Aardvark is the only surviving member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Orycteropodidae''' and of the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Tubulidentata'''. The Aardvark was originally placed in the same [[genus]] as the [[anteater|South American anteater]]s because of superficial similarities which, it is now known, are the result of [[convergent evolution]], not common ancestry. (For the same reason, Aardvarks bear a striking first-glance resemblance to the [[marsupial]] [[Bilby|bilbies]] and [[Bandicoot|bandicoots]] of [[Australasia]], which are not [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] at all.)

The oldest known Tubulidentata fossils have been found in [[Kenya]] and date to the early [[Miocene]]. Although the relationships of Tubulidentata are unknown, they are probably [[Ungulates]]. They spread to Europe and [[southern Asia]] during the later Miocene and early [[Pliocene]] periods. Three genera of the family Orycteropodidae are known: ''Leptorycteropus'', ''Myorycteropus'', and ''Orycteropus'', the surviving Aardvark. A genus from Madagascar may be related to them, called ''Plesiorycteropus''.

The most distinctive characteristic of the Tubulidentata is (as the name implies) their teeth which, instead of having a pulp cavity, have lots of thin tubes of dentine, each containing pulp and held together by cementum. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. Aardvarks are born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, but these fall out and are not replaced. In adult Aardvarks, the only teeth are the molars at the back of the jaw.

[[Image:Orycteropus afer01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aardvark]]

Aardvarks are only vaguely pig-like; the body is stout with an arched back; the limbs are of moderate length. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb')&amp;mdash;resulting in four toes&amp;mdash;but the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. The ears are disproportionately long and the tail very thick at the base with a gradual taper.  The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and at the end of the snout is a disk in which the nostrils open.  The mouth is typical of species that feed on termites: small and tubular. Aardvarks have long, thin, protrusible tongues and elaborate structures supporting a keen [[olfaction|sense of smell]].

Weight is typically between 40 and 65 kg; length is usually between 1 and 1.3 m. Aardvarks are a pale yellowish gray in color, often stained reddish-brown by soil. The coat is thin and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin; Aardvarks have been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, so well does it protect them. 

In the past, several individual species of Aardvark were named, however current knowledge indicates that there is only one species, ''Orycteropus afer'', with several subspecies; 18 have been listed but most are regarded as invalid.

Aardvarks are [[nocturnal]] and solitary creatures that feed almost exclusively on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. An Aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food. When a concentration of ants or termites is found, the Aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue&amp;mdash;as many as 50,000 in one night has been recorded. They are exceptionally fast diggers, but otherwise move rather slowly. 

Aside from digging out ants and termites, aardvarks also excavate burrows to live in: temporary sites scattered around the home range as refuges, and the main burrow which is used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances, and be 13m long. Aardvarks change the layout of their home burrow regularly, and from time to time move on and make a new one. Only mothers and young share burrows.

After a gestation period of 7 months, a single young weighing around 2 kg is born, and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks. At six months of age it is digging its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next [[mating season]]. Aardvarks can grow older than 20 years in captivity.

Aardvarks are distributed across most of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and although killed by humans both for their flesh and for their teeth (which are used as decorations), do not appear to be threatened.

''Aardvark'' is always the first noun in the English dictionary. 

More precise information are given in a diploma thesis on the biology of the aardvark which can be downloaded here: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Image:Aardvark.pdf '''The Biology of the Aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'')

The '''Aardwolf''' (''Proteles cristatus'') is a small [[mammal]] related to the [[Hyena]], native to Africa. The name means &quot;earth wolf&quot; in [[Afrikaans]].

There are two subspecies: 

* ''Proteles cristatus cristatus'' ([[Southern Africa]])
* ''Proteles cristatus septentrionalis'' ([[East Africa]])

The Aardwolf looks most like the [[Striped Hyena]] but smaller with a more pointed [[muzzle]], sharper [[ear]]s, vertical stripes, and a long mane down the middle line of the neck and back. It stands about 50 cm at the shoulder, weighs around 9 kg, and has two glands at the rear that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and communicating with other aardwolves.

[[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Aardwolf from the zoo in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]]]

The Aardwolf is nocturnal, sleeping in underground burrows by day. By night, an Aardwolf can consume up to 200,000 harvester [[termites]]. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, and eggs.

While primarily solitary, a mating pair will occupy the same territory with their young. Gestation lasts between 90 and 100 days. The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with the mother. After three months, they begin supervised foraging and set off on their own shortly thereafter.

[[Image:AdobeSurfaceCoatingRenewalOnWall.jpg|frame|right|Renewal of the surface coating of an adobe wall in Chamisal, New Mexico]]

'''Adobe''' is a [[building material]] composed of water, [[sand]]y [[clay]] and  [[straw]] or other organic materials, which is shaped into bricks using wooden frames and dried in the sun, also known as [[Mudbrick]] . Adobe structures are extremely durable and account for the oldest extant buildings on the planet. Adobe buildings also offer significant advantages in hot, dry [[climate]]s, as they remain cooler as it stores and releases heat very slowly.  

The word &quot;adobe&quot; is Spanish and comes from the Arabic &quot;at-tub&quot;, the brick, and from the Coptic &quot;tObe&quot;. The word may be pronounced ah-doh-beh or uh-doh-bee. Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common in [[the Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and in [[Spain]] (usually in the [[Mudejar]] style). The method of brickmaking was imported to the Americas in the [[16th century]] by Spaniards.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller ''adobes,'' which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger ''adobines,'' some of which are as much as from one to two yards long.

In more modern usage, the term &quot;adobe&quot; has come to mean a style of architecture that is popular in the [[desert]] [[climate]]s of [[North America]], especially in [[New Mexico]].  Cf. [[stucco]].

[[Image:Adobe kilns from HABS.jpg|frame|right|Detail of Adobe kilns in Arizona]]

==Composition of adobe==
An adobe brick is made of soil mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or animal dung. The soil composition typically contains [[clay]] and [[sand]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly. Dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects.

==Adobe bricks==
Bricks are made in an open frame, 25 cm (10 inches) by 36 cm (14 inches) is a reasonable size, but any convenient size is fine for your own use. After the mud is put into the frame the frame is removed. After a few hours the bricks are put on edge to finish drying. Bricks should be dried in the shade to avoid cracking.

Use the same mixture you use to make bricks for mortar when laying the bricks and for plaster on the interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used concrete for the plaster to avoid rain damage. It is sometimes useful to include occasional pieces of wood as you lay a wall to give something to nail insulation onto, and stone can be used for additional strength.

The largest structure ever made from adobe (bricks), was the [[Bam Citadel]], which suffered serious damage, up to 80%, by an earthquake on December 26, 2003. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in [[Peru]], built using 100 million signed bricks, and the ciudellas of [[Chan Chan]], also in Peru.

==Thermal properties==

Because an adobe wall, either made of bricks or using a [[rammed earth]] technique, is quite massive it will hold heat or cold.  A south facing adobe wall may be left uninsulated in order to collect heat during the day. It should be thick enough that it remains cool on the inside during the heat of the day but should be thin enough that the heat can be transferred through the wall by evening. Such a wall can be covered with glass to increase heat collection. Used in a [[passive solar heating|passive solar]] home, such a wall is called a [[Trombe wall]].   Adobe has a large thermal mass, therefore this type of construction is only good in tropical climates. In temperate climates it is almost impossible to heat a home of this type as the heat is leached by the ground and the walls.

'''Adventure''' refers to events which happen unexpectedly and involve the chance of danger or loss.  Adventures can include daring feats, remarkable occurrences, stirring encounters, and major life undertakings.  

Adventurous experiences create psychological and physiological [[arousal]] which can be interpreted as negative (e.g., [[fear]]) or positive (e.g., [[flow]]) (see [[Yerkes-Dodson law]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself, for example see [[Extreme Sports]].

===Applications of Adventure===

Adventure is a term used in many contexts and situations.  For example, it is a key component of  [[narrative]], [[story-telling]], [[drama]] and [[role-playing]] and the concept is used to structure and interpet [[books]], [[film]]s, music and [[computer games]].  Adventure is also used within [[education]], [[sport]], [[tourism]] and others forms of [[entertainment]].  Examples of these adventure genres and applications include:

* [[Adventure education]] is the use of challenging experiences for learning.
* [[Adventure film]] is a film genre.
* [[Adventure game]] is a computer game genre.
* [[Adventure novel]] is a fiction genre.
* [[Adventure (role-playing games)]] involve acting out a specific storyline or plotline.
* [[Adventure racing]] involves competing in multiple outdoor adventure extreme sports.
* [[Adventure tourism]] offers travellers chances to have exciting travel encounters.

'''Agaves''' are [[succulent plant|succulent]] [[plant]]s of a large botanical genus of the same name, belonging to the family [[Agavaceae]]. Chiefly [[Mexico|Mexican]], they occur also in the southern and western [[United States]] and in central and tropical [[South America]].  The plants have a large rosette of thick fleshy leaves generally ending in a sharp point and with a spiny margin; the stout stem is usually short, the leaves apparently springing from the root.

Each rosette is [[monocarpic]] and grows slowly to flower but once after a number of years, when a tall stem or &quot;mast&quot; grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of shortly tubular flowers.  After development of fruit the original plant dies, but suckers are frequently produced from the base of the stem which become new plants.

[[Image:Agaveattenuata1web.jpg|thumb|left|Swan's Neck Agave (''Agave attenuata'')]]
The most familiar species is ''[[Agave americana]]'', a native of tropical America, the so-called [[century plant|Century Plant]] or American [[aloe]] (the [[maguey]] of Mexico). The name refers to the long time the plant takes to flower, although the number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual, the richness of the soil and the climate; during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering. During the development of the inflorescence there is a rush of sap to the base of the young flowerstalk. In the case of ''A. americana'' and other species this is used by the Mexicans to make their national beverage, [[pulque]]; the flower shoot is cut out and the sap collected and subsequently fermented. By distillation a spirit called [[mezcal]] is prepared. The leaves of several species yield fiber, as for instance, ''Agave rigida var. sisalana'', [[sisal]] hemp, ''Agave decipiens'', False Sisal Hemp; ''Agave americana'' is the source of pita fiber, and is used as a fiber plant in Mexico, the [[West Indies]] and southern [[Europe]]. The flowering stem of the last named, dried and cut in slices, forms natural razor strops, and the expressed juice of the leaves will lather in water like soap. The Native Americans of Mexico used the agave both to make pens, nails and needles as well as string to sew and make weavings. In [[India]] the plant is extensively used for hedges along railroads.

[[Image:Aloe-flower.jpg|thumb|Agave in bloom in a garden (Roquevaire, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, France, September 1978)]]

''Agave americana'', century plant, was introduced into Europe about the middle of the [[16th century]] and is now widely cultivated for its handsome appearance; in the variegated forms the leaf has a white or yellow marginal or central stripe from base to apex. As the leaves unfold from the center of the rosette the impression of the marginal spines is very conspicuous on the still erect younger leaves. The tequ plants are usually grown in tubs and put out in the summer months, but in the winter require protection from frost. They mature very slowly and die after flowering, but are easily propagated by the offsets from the base of the stem.

Agave [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] has been used as an alternative to [[sugar]] in cooking.

The juice from many species of agave can cause acute contact [[dermatitis]].  It will produce reddening and blistering lasting one to two weeks.  Episodes of itching may recur up to a year thereafter, even though there is no longer a visible rash.  Interestingly, dried parts of the plants can be handled with bare hands with little or no effect.

==Taxonomy==
Agaves were once classified in [[Liliaceae]] but most references now include them in their own family, [[Agavaceae]].

Agaves have long presented special difficulties for [[taxonomy]]; variations within a species may be considerable, and a number of named species are of unknown origin, and may just be variants of original wild species. 

Spanish and Portuguese explorers probably brought agaves back with them, but really became popular in Europe during the [[19th century]], with many types being imported by collectors. Some of have been continuously propagated by offset since then, and do not consistently resemble any species known in nature, although this may simply be due to the unnatural growing conditions in Europe.

'''Asia''' is the largest and most populous region or [[continent]] depending on the definition.  It is traditionally defined as part of the [[landmass]] of [[Africa]]-[[Eurasia]] lying east of the [[Suez Canal]], east of the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s. About 60% of the world's [[human population]] lives in Asia, of whom only 2% live in the northern and interior half ([[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Xinjiang]], [[Tibet]], [[Qinghai]], western [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]); the other 98% live in the remaining half.
[[Image:LocationAsia.png|thumb|250px|World map showing Asia.]]
==Etymology==
The word ''Asia'' entered English, via [[Latin]], from [[Ancient Greek]] ŒëœÉŒØŒ± (''Asia''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). This name is first attested in [[Herodotus]] (c. 440 BC), where it refers to [[Asia Minor]]; or, for the purposes of describing the [[Persian Wars]], to the [[Persian Empire]], as opposed to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three different women's names are used to describe a single land-mass ([[Europa]], Asia and [[Libya]], referring to Africa) stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] but that the [[Lydians]] say it was named after [[Asias]], son of [[Cotys]] who passed the name on to a tribe in [[Sardis]]. 

Even before Herodotus, [[Homer]] knew of a [[Troy|Trojan]] ally named [[Asios Hyrtakides|Asios]], son of [[Hyrtacus]], a ruler over several towns, and elsewhere he describes a marsh as Œ±œÉŒπŒøœÇ (Iliad 2, 461). The Greek term may be derived from [[Assuwa]], a [[14th century BC]] confederation of states in Western Anatolia. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''assu-'' &quot;good&quot; is probably an element in that name. 

Alternatively, the ultimate etymology of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''(w)a·π£√ª(m)'', cognate of Hebrew ◊ô◊¶◊ê, which means &quot;to go out&quot; or &quot;to ascend&quot;, referring to the direction of the [[sun]] at sunrise in the [[Middle East]], and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ''erƒìbu'' &quot;to enter&quot; or &quot;set&quot; (of the sun). However, an originally Mesopotamian or Middle Eastern perspective would not explain how the term &quot;Asia&quot; first came to be associated with Anatolia as lying ''west'' of the Semitic speaking area.

==Definition and Boundaries==
[[Image:Asia-map.png|right|thumb|280px|Political map of Asia]]
Medieval Europeans considered Asia as a continent, a distinct landmass. The European concept of the three continents in the [[Old World]] goes back to [[classical antiquity]] with the [[etymology]] of the word rooted in the ancient [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]]. The demarcation between Asia and [[Africa]] is the [[Isthmus]] of [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]]. The boundary between Asia and [[Europe]] is commonly believed to run through the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the Black Sea, the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, the [[Ural River]] to its source, and the Ural Mountains to the [[Kara Sea]] near Kara, [[Russia]]. However, modern discovery of the extent of Africa and Asia made this definition rather anachronistic, especially in the case of Asia, which would have several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if these criteria were used (for example, South Asia and East Asia). 

Geologists and physical geographers no longer consider Asia and Europe to be separate continents. It is either defined in terms of geological landmasses (physical geography) or tectonic plates (geology). In the former case, Europe is a western peninsula of [[Eurasia]] or the Africa-Eurasia landmass. In the latter, Europe and Asia are still part of the Eurasian plate, which excludes the Arabian and Indian tectonic plates. 

In human geography, there are two schools of thought. One school follows historical convention and treats Europe and Asia as different continents, categorizing Europe, East Asia (the Orient), South Asia (British India), and the Middle East (Arabia and Persia) as specific regions for more detailed analysis. The other schools equate the word &quot;continent&quot; in terms of geographical region when referring to Europe, and use the term &quot;region&quot; to describe Asia in terms of physical geography. Because in linguistic terms, &quot;continent&quot; implies a distinct landmass, it is becoming increasingly common to substitute the term &quot;region&quot; for &quot;continent&quot; to avoid the problem of disambiguation altogether.

There is much confusion in European languages with the term &quot;Asian&quot;. Because a category implies homogenity, the term &quot;Asian&quot; almost always refers to a subcategory of people from Asia rather than referring to &quot;Asian&quot; defined in term of &quot;Asia&quot;. The fact that in American English, Asian refers to East Asian (Orientals), while in British English, Asian refers to South Asian reflects this confusion. Sometimes, it is not even clear exactly what &quot;Asia&quot; consists of. Some definitions exclude [[Turkey]], the Middle East, and/or Russia. The term is sometimes used more strictly in reference to [[Asia Pacific]], which does not include the Middle East or Russia, but does include islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] &amp;mdash; a number of which may also be considered part of [[Australasia]] and/or [[Oceania]]. Asia contains the [[Indian subcontinent]], Arabian subcontinent, as well as a piece of the North American plate in Siberia.

==Geographical regions==
{{seealso|Geography of Asia}}
[[Image:Asia satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|280px|Satellite view of Asia]]
As already mentioned, Asia is a subregion of [[Eurasia]]. For further subdivisions based on that term, see [[North Eurasia]] and [[Central Eurasia]].

Some Asian countries stretch beyond Asia. See [[Bicontinental country]] for details about the borderline cases between Asia and Europe, Asia and Africa, and Asia and Oceania.

The following subregions of Asia are traditionally recognized:
*[[Central Asia]]
*[[East Asia]]
*[[Far East]]
*[[North Asia]]
*[[South Asia]] (or Indian Subcontinent)
*[[Southeast Asia]]
*[[Southwest Asia]] (or Middle East or West Asia)

===Central Asia===
There is no absolute consensus in the usage of this term. Usually, Central Asia includes:
* the [[Central Asian Republics]] of [[Kazakhstan]] (excluding its small [[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Europe|European]] territory), [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].
* [[Afghanistan]], [[Mongolia]], and the western regions of [[China]] are also sometimes included.
* Former [[Soviet]] states in the [[Caucasus]] region.

Central Asia is currently geopolitically important because international disputes and conflicts over [[oil pipeline|oil pipelines]],  [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], and [[Chechnya]], as well as the presence of [[U.S. military]] and [[Military of the UK|U.K. military]] forces in [[Afghanistan]].

===East Asia ===
This area includes:
* The [[Pacific Ocean]] island countries of [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]]. {{further|[[Political status of Taiwan]]}}
* [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] on the [[Korean Peninsula]].
* [[China]], but sometimes only the eastern regions

Sometimes the nations of [[Mongolia]] and [[Vietnam]] are also included in East Asia.

More informally, [[Southeast Asia]] is included in East Asia on some occasions.

===North Asia===
This term is rarely used by geographers, but usually it refers to the bigger Asian part of Russia, also known as [[Siberia]]. Sometimes the northern parts of other Asian nations, such as [[Kazakhstan]] are also included in Northern Asia.

===South Asia (or Indian Subcontinent)===
South Asia is also referred to as the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. It includes:
* The [[Himalayan States]] of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[Indian Ocean]] nations of [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Maldives]]. India's [[Andaman]], [[Nicobar]] and [[Lakshadweep]] islands also lie in the Indian Ocean.
* The [[peninsular India]] (also known as the [[Deccan Plateau]])
* Sometimes Afghanistan is also included into this category.

===Southeast Asia===
This region contains the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Indochina]] and islands in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. The countries it contains are:

* In [[Indochina|mainland Southeast Asia]], the countries [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]].

* In [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], the countries of [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Indonesia]] ([[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Oceania|some]] of the Indonesian islands also lie in the [[Melanesia]] region of [[Oceania]]). [[East Timor]] (also [[Melanesia]]n) is sometimes included too.

The country of [[Malaysia]] is divided in two by the [[South China Sea]], and thus has both a mainland and island part.

===Southwest Asia (or Middle East, Near East or West Asia)===
This can also be called by the Western term ''[[Middle East]]'', which is commonly used by Europeans and Americans. ''Middle East'' (to some interpretations) is often used to also refer to some countries in [[North Africa]]. Southwest Asia can be further divided into:

* [[Anatolia]] (i.e. [[Asia Minor]]), constituting the [[Asian]] [[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Europe|part of]] Turkey.
* The [[island nation]] of [[Cyprus]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].
* The [[Levant]] or [[Near East]], which includes [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]] and the Asian [[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Africa|portion]] of [[Egypt]].
* The [[Arabian peninsula]], including [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]] and [[Kuwait]].
* The [[Caucasus]] region (which straddles both Asia and [[Europe]]), namely [[Transcaucasia]], including a small portion of Russia and, arguably, most if not all of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan]].
* The [[Iranian Plateau]], containing [[Iran]] and parts of other neighbouring nations.

{{main|Economy of Asia}}
In terms of [[gross domestic product]] ([[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]]), the largest national economy within Asia is that of the [[PRC]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).  Over the last decade, China's and [[India]]'s economies have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate above 7%.  PRC is the world's second largest economy after the US, followed by [[Japan]] and [[India]] as the world's third and fourth largest economies respectively (then followed by the European nations: [[Germany]], [[U.K.]], [[France]] and [[Italy]]).

In terms of [[exchange rates]] (nominal GDP) however, Japan has the largest economy in Asia and second largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in [[Net Material Product]]) in 1986 and Germany in 1968.  (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[EU]], [[NAFTA]] or [[APEC]]).  Economic growth in Asia since [[World War II]] to the 1990's had been concentrated in few countries of the [[Pacific Rim]], and has spread more recently to other regions.  In the late 80's and early 90's Japan's economy was almost as large as that of the rest of the continent combined.  In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equalled the USA to tie the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 [[yen]].  However, since then Japan's currency has corrected and China has grown to be the second largest Asian economy, followed by India in terms of exchange rates.  It is expected that China will surpass Japan in currency terms to have the largest nominal GDP in Asia within a decade or two.

===Natural resources===
Asia is by a considerable margin the largest continent in the [[world]], and is rich in natural resources, such as [[Petroleum]] and [[iron]].

High productivity in agriculture, especially of [[rice]], allows high population density of countries in the warm and humid area.  Other main agricultural products include [[wheat]] and [[chicken]].

Forestry is extensive throughout Asia except Southwest and Central Asia. [[Fishing]] is a major source of food in Asia, particularly in Japan.

===Manufacturing===
Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in [[PRC]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]]. The industry varies from manufacturing cheap goods such as [[toy]]s to high-tech goods such as [[computer]]s and [[automobile|car]]s.  Many companies from [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]] have significant operations in the developing Asia to take avantage of its abundant supply of cheap labor.

One of the major employers in manufacturing in Asia is the [[textile]] industry. Much of the world's supply of clothing and footwear now originates in Southeast Asia.

===Financial and other services===
Asia has three main financial centers. They are in [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Tokyo]]. Call centers are becoming major employers in [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], due to the availablity of many well-educated English speakers. The rise of the business process [[outsourcing]] industry has seen the rise of India and China as the other financial centers.

==Early history==
{{main|History of Asia}}
[[Image:Asia 1892 amer ency brit.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Asia, 1892.]]
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions &amp;mdashl [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], and the [[Middle East]] &amp;mdash; linked by the interior mass of the [[Central Asia]]n [[steppe]].

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys.  The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]], and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] shared many similarities, and may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel.  Other innovations, such as that of writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area.  Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads, and from the steppes they could reach all areas of Asia.  The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Indo-European]]s, who spread their languages into the Middle East, India, and in the [[Tocharians]], to the borders of China. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, the climate, and the [[tundra]].  These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The centre and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts.  The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty.  While technologically and socially, the urban city dwellers were more advanced, in many cases they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force;  for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

==Population density==
The following table lists countries and dependencies by [[population density]] in inhabitants and km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Unlike the figures in the country articles, the figures in this table are based on areas including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and may therefore be lower here.

The whole of Egypt, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey are referred to in the table, although they may be considered to be only [[Countries in both Europe and Asia|partly in Asia]]. Asia also contains about 60% of the world's population. Leaving the other 40% of the world's population to other continents.

'''Aruba''' is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], just a short distance north of the [[Venezuela]]n [[Paraguan√° Peninsula]], and it forms a part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, it has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape.  This climate has helped tourism, however, as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. 
 
==History==
:''Main article: [[History of Aruba]]''

Discovered and claimed for [[Spain]] in 1499, Aruba was acquired by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries. A [[19th century|19th-century]] [[gold]] rush was followed by prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an [[Petroleum|oil]] refinery. The last decades of the [[20th century]] saw a boom in the [[tourism]] industry. 

Aruba seceded from the [[Netherlands Antilles]] on [[January 1]], [[1986]], and became a separate, self-governing member of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  Movement toward full independence by [[1996]] was halted at Aruba's request in 1990.

==Politics==
:''Main article: [[Politics of Aruba]]''

Aruba is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but maintains full control over its own affairs except for issues dealing with national defence, citizenship, foreign affairs, and extradition. Aruba has its own laws, constitution, government, and currency.

The Aruban [[head of state]] is the ruling monarch of the [[Netherlands]], who is represented in Aruba by a [[governor]], appointed for a six-year term. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister]], who forms, together with the Council of Ministers, the [[executive branch]] of the government. 

They are elected by the [[parliament]], the [[unicameral]] Legislature or ''Staten'', which holds 21 seats. Members are elected by direct, popular vote to serve four-year terms.

==Geography==
:''Main article: [[Geography of Aruba]]''

Aruba is a generally flat, [[river]]less island renowned for its white sand [[beach]]es. Most of these are located on the western and southern coasts of the island, which are relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.  The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.  The interior of the island features some rolling hills, the better two of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at 165 [[metre]]s (541 [[foot (unit of length|ft]]) and [[Mount Jamanota]], which is the highest on the island, at 188 metres (617 ft) above [[sea level]]. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{coor dm|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.

As a separate member state of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the island/state has no administrative subdivisions. On the east are [[Cura√ßao]] and [[Bonaire]],two island territories which form the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]; Aruba and these two Netherlands Antilles islands are also known as the [[ABC islands]].

The local [[climate]] is a pleasant tropical marine climate. Little seasonal temperature variation exists, which helps Aruba to attract tourists all year round. Temperatures are almost constant at about 28&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|¬∞C]] (82&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|¬∞F]]), moderated by constant [[trade wind]]s from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  Yearly precipitation barely reaches 500 [[millimeter|mm]] (20 [[inch|in]]), most of it falling in late autumn.  [[Image:Aruba_map.png|right|Map of Aruba with cities]]

==Economy==
:''Main article: [[Economy of Aruba]]''

Aruba enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region, with low poverty and unemployment rates.  About half of the Aruban [[Gross National Product]] is earned with [[tourism]] or related activities. Most of the tourists are from [[Canada]], the [[European Union]] and other places notably the [[United States]], which is the country's largest trading partner. Oil processing is the dominant industry in Aruba, despite expansion of the tourism sector. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing industries remains minimal.

Deficit spending has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well, although recent efforts at tightening monetary policy may correct this. Aruba receives some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year. The Aruban guilder has a fixed exchange rate with the [[United States dollar]] of 1.79:1.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|300px|left|Population of Aruba, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
Having poor [[soil]] and aridity, Aruba was saved from plantation economics and the [[slave trade]].  In 1515, the Spanish transported the entire population to [[Hispaniola]] to work in the [[copper]] [[mining|mines]]; most were allowed to return when the mines were tapped out. The Dutch, who took control a century later, left the [[Arawaks]] to graze livestock, using the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. No full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Indians]] remain, but the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic heritage. The majority of the population is descended from Arawak, Dutch and Spanish ancestors.  Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring Latin American and Caribbean nations, attracted by the lure of well-paying jobs.

The two official languages are the Dutch language and the predominant, national language [[Papiamento]], which is classified as a Creole language. This [[creole language]] is formed primarily from 16th century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and several other languages. Spanish and English are also spoken.  Islanders can often speak four or more languages and are mostly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

==Culture==
:''Main article: [[Culture of Aruba]]''

The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture. Dutch influence can still be seen, even though not much of the population is of Dutch origin. Tourism from the United States has recently also increased the visibility of American culture on the island. [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]], located near [[Oranjestad, Aruba]], currently serves the whole island of Aruba. This airport has access to various cities across the eastern U.S., from Miami, Orlando, Houston, Atlanta to New York. It also connects Aruba with Europe through the [[Schiphol Airport]] in the Netherlands.

The holiday of [[Carnival]] is an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries.  Carnival is usually held from the beginning of January until the end of February, with a large parade on the final Sunday of the festivities.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Aruba}}
Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The cultural mixture has given way to a linguistic mixture known as &quot;[[Papiamento]]&quot;. However, islanders are known to speak many languages. Islanders often speak Papiamento, English, Dutch and Spanish. In recent years the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Articles page1.jpg|thumb|right|The Articles of Confederation]] 
The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', commonly known as the '''Articles of Confederation''' was the first governing document of the [[United States|United States of America]]. 

The articles, which combined the [[13 colonies]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]] into a loose [[confederation]], were adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] on [[November 15]], [[1777]], after 16 months of debate. The articles were ratified three years later on March 1, 1781. 

The articles were eventually replaced by the [[United States Constitution]] on June 21, 1788, when the ninth state, [[New Hampshire]], ratified the Constitution. According to their own terms for modification, however, the articles were still in effect until 1790, when every one of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

== Ratification ==
The Articles of Confederation were submitted to the states for ratification on [[November 17]] [[1777]], accompanied by a letter from Congress urging that the document

:''be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. '' {{ref|ratificationletter}}

The document only became effective as it was ratified by the states. This process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west. [[Maryland]] was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until [[Virginia]] and [[New York]] agreed to rescind their claims to lands in the [[Ohio River]] valley. All of the colonies rebelling against Britain ratified it by [[1781]].

Although Congress debated the Articles for over a year, it requested immediate action on the part of the states. On [[February 5]] [[1778]] [[South Carolina]] became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation. However, three and a half years passed before the final ratification by [[Maryland]] on [[March 1]] [[1781]].

==Article Summaries ==
{{ChartersOfFreedom}}
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by much of the same people, they were still very different. The document contained 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.

#Establishes the name of the confederation as &quot;The United States of America&quot;
#Explains the rights possessed by any state, and the amount of power to which any state is entitled
#Establishes the United States as a league of states united &quot;...for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them...&quot;
#Establishes [[freedom of movement]]&amp;ndash;anyone can pass freely between states, excluding &quot;[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond]]s, and [[fugitive]]s from justice excepted.&quot; All people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he or she travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
#Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (United States in Congress Assembled) to each state, which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress were appointed by state legislatures; individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years.
#Limits the powers of states to conduct [[foreign relations]] and to [[declaration of war|declare war]].
#When an army is raised for common defense, [[Colonel (United States)|colonels]] and [[military rank]]s below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
#Expenditures by the United States will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
#Defines the rights of the central government: to declare war, to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.
#Defines a [[Committee of the States]] to be a government when Congress is not in session.
#Requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy; preapproves [[Canada]], if they apply for membership.
#Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the articles ([[assumption]]).
#Declares that the articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by ''all'' the state legislatures.

Still at war with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the colonists were reluctant to establish another powerful national government. Jealously guarding their new independence, the Continental Congress created a loosely structured [[unicameral]] legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states at the expense of the confederation. While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism to ensure states complied with requests for troops or revenue. At times this left the military in a precarious position, as [[George Washington]] wrote in a [[1781]] letter to the governor of [[Massachusetts]], [[John Hancock]].

== The end of the war ==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], ending hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature. Yet, Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Writing to [[George Clinton (politician)|George Clinton]] in September [[1783]], George Washington complained:

:''Congress have come to no determination yet respecting the Peace Establishment, nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss Great National points.'' {{ref|washingtonclinton}}

==Function==
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the [[Continental Army]], and allowed the [[13 Colonies|Thirteen Colonies]] to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. But as an instrument of government, they were largely a failure. Congress could make decisions, but had no power to enforce them.

Perhaps the most important power that Congress was denied was the power of taxation: Congress could only request [[money]] from the states. Understandably, the states did not generally comply with the requests in full, leaving the confederation chronically short of funds. The states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war, and paying congressional debts became a major issue.

Nevertheless the [[Continental Congress]] did take two actions with lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later American expansion. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of [[1787]] noted the agreement of the original states to give up western land claims and cleared the way for the entry of new states.

Once the unity demanded by the Revolutionary War became unnecessary, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against Indian attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington|Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced the Congress to leave [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on [[June 21]].

==Revision==
In May [[1786]], [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.

In September, five states assembled in the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] to discuss adjustments that would improve commerce. Under their chairman, [[Alexander Hamilton]], they invited state representatives to convene in [[Philadelphia]] to discuss improvements to the federal government. After debate, Congress endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on [[February 21]] [[1787]]. According to some historians, the Articles were flawed; in particular, the [[confederal]] government was unable to settle state disputes on issues like trade and had no power to tax directly. After all, the states were thirteen individual [[republics]]. It took radical action to strip them of that [[sovereignty]].

==Lessons==
Although ultimately replaced by the [[United States Constitution]], the Articles of Confederation provided stability during the [[American Revolutionary War]] years. Most importantly, the experience of drafting and living under this initial document provided valuable lessons in self-governance and somewhat tempered fears about a powerful central government. Still, reconciling the turmoil between state and federal authority continues to challenge America, as seen in such conflicts as the [[1832]] [[Nullification Crisis]], the [[American Civil War]] ([[1861]]-[[1865|65]]), post-Civil War [[Reconstruction]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision in [[1954]].
*****

==Signatures==
The copy of the Articles in the U.S. National Archives has a series of signatures on page six. A list of them is presented here. The signing of the Articles was a process that has caused some confusion. The Articles were approved for distribution to the states, on [[November 15]], [[1777]]. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. The copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and a cover letter had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.

But, the Articles at that time were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on [[June 27]], [[1778]]. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

Then, on [[July 9]], [[1778]] the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified. New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified. North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on [[August 8]]. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on [[July 10]]), and the delegation signed the Articles on [[July 21]], [[1778]].

The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles, and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on [[July 24]], New Jersey on [[November 26]], and Delaware on [[February 12]], [[1779]]. After a wait of two years, Maryland ratified, and her delegates signed the Articles on [[March 1]], [[1781]]. The articles were finally in force.

Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''' were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.

The signers and the states they represented were:
* [[New Hampshire]]: [[Josiah Bartlett]] and [[John Wentworth Jr.]]
* [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts Bay]]: [[John Hancock]], [[Samuel Adams]], [[Elbridge Gerry]], [[Francis Dana]], [[James Lovell (delegate)|James Lovell]], and [[Samuel Holten]]
* [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]: [[William Ellery]], [[Henry Marchant]], and [[John Collins (delegate)|John Collins]]
* [[Connecticut]]: [[Roger Sherman]], [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]], [[Oliver Wolcott]], [[Titus Hosmer]], and [[Andrew Adams]]
* [[New York]]: [[James Duane]], [[Francis Lewis]], [[William Duer (1747-1799)|William Duer]], and [[Gouverneur Morris]]
* [[New Jersey]]: [[John Witherspoon]] and [[Nathaniel Scudder]]
* [[Pennsylvania]]: [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]], [[Daniel Roberdeau]], [[Jonathan Bayard Smith]], [[William Clingan]], and [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]]
* [[Delaware]]: [[Thomas McKean]], [[John Dickinson (1732-1808)|John Dickinson]], and [[Nicholas Van Dyke (1738-1789)|Nicholas Van Dyke]]
* [[Maryland]]: [[John Hanson]] and [[Daniel Carroll]]
* [[Virginia]]: [[Richard Henry Lee]], [[John Banister]], [[Thomas Adams (politician)|Thomas Adams]], [[John Harvie]], and [[Francis Lightfoot Lee]]

The following list are those who led the [[Congress]] under the Articles of Confederation as the [[President of the United States in Congress Assembled|Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled]]. The &quot;president&quot; under the Articles was the presiding officer of Congress, not the chief [[executive (government)|executive]], as is the [[President of the United States]] under the Constitution. Also, the Articles defined the powers of a [[confederation]] of states as opposed to the current [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], which defines the powers of a [[federation]] of states.

'''Adam Sedgwick''' ([[March 22]], [[1785]] &amp;ndash; [[January 27]], [[1873]]) was one of the founders of modern [[geology]].  He proposed the [[Devonian period]] of the geological timescale and later the [[Cambrian]] period. The latter proposal was based on work which he did on [[Wales|Welsh]] rock strata.

Sedgwick was born in [[Dent (Lonsdale)|Dent]], at that time in [[Yorkshire]], the third child of an Anglican vicar. He was educated at [[Sedbergh School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

==Introduction==

In [[1817]] he took [[holy orders]], and in [[1818]] he became [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] [[University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences|Department of Earth Sciences]], holding a chair that had been endowed ninety years before by the natural historian [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]]. He lacked formal training in geology, but he quickly became an active researcher in geology and [[paleontology]]. During his tenure, he immensely enlarged the geological collections of Cambridge University, and carried out important field research all over [[Great Britain]]. Sedgwick is said to have remarked, upon being appointed Woodwardian Professor, &quot;Hitherto I have never turned a stone; henceforth I will leave no stone unturned.&quot; In [[1822]] he carried out fieldwork unraveling the complex geology of the [[Lake District]] of [[northern England]], armed with the new discoveries and techniques of [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]. He met and befriended the poet [[William Wordsworth]] on this expedition, and also met the poet [[Robert Southey]] and the chemist [[John Dalton]]. His lectures at [[Cambridge]] were immensely popular; he was a spellbinding [[lecturer]], and -- breaking with the traditions of his time -- his lectures were open to women, whom Sedgwick thought could make great contributions to natural history. He continued to rise in his profession: in [[1829]] he became President of the [[Geological Society of London]], and in [[1845]] a Vice-Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. As Vice-Master, he led campaigns to open Cambridge to non-[[Anglican]]s and to reorganize the academic programs, in the process meeting and becoming close to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and her consort [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]]. By the 1850s he was in poor health, cared for by his niece Isabella. Still, he kept giving his famous lectures until [[1871]].

==Early work==

Sedgwick was one of several great figures in what has been called the Heroic Age of geology -- the time when the great geological time periods were defined, and when much exploration and fundamental research was carried out. Sedgwick's work placed him at the epicenter of one of the most heated geological controversies of his day, stemming from his work with the gentleman geologist [[Roderick Murchison]]. They explored the [[geology of Scotland]] in [[1827]], and in [[1839]] they jointly presented their researches on certain rocks in [[Devon]], [[England]], which had a distinctive [[fossil]] assemblage that led them to propose a new division of the geological time scale -- the [[Devonian]]. In the early 1830s, both men were working on the rocks of Wales, which were and are very difficult to work on due to extensive [[folding]] and [[geologic fault|faulting]]. However, they seemed to be older than most of the [[sedimentary rocks]] farther east. Murchison documented the presence of a distinctive set of fossils, one in which very few fish were found, but that included numerous different types of [[trilobites]], [[brachiopods]], and other such fossils. Murchison named the system of rocks containing such fossils the [[Silurian]], after the Silures, a Celtic tribe living in the Welsh Borderlands at the time of the Romans. Sedgwick, who had been working in central Wales, proposed the existence of a separate system below the Silurian, which he named the [[Cambrian]] -- after Cambria, the Latin name for Wales. The two presented a joint paper in [[1835]], entitled &quot;On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, exhibiting the order in which the older sedimentary strata succeed each other in England and Wales.&quot; 

Sedgwick's upper &quot;Cambrian&quot; overlapped with the lower part of Murchison's &quot;Silurian.&quot; Sedgwick had defined his &quot;Cambrian&quot; using physical characters of the rocks, which were unique to Wales, and had not relied extensively on fossils, which could be found everywhere. Murchison, who had used fossils extensively in defining the Silurian, claimed at first that the upper Cambrian, and then the entire Cambrian, were really parts of the Silurian. The resulting quarrel between the two men left them permanently estranged and took years to resolve. There was more than a simple matter of names involved. Both geologists wanted the honour of describing the rocks that recorded the beginning of life on Earth, for no fossils were known that were older than those of the Cambrian. Murchison felt that the fossils of Sedgwick's &quot;Cambrian&quot; were not different enough from his &quot;Silurian&quot; forms to merit the naming of a geologic time period, and it was some time before truly distinctive Cambrian fossils were documented. Today, following the solution worked out in 1879 by Sedgwick's colleague [[Charles Lapworth]], geologists use both time periods, with a third one -- the [[Ordovician]], also named for a Celtic tribe in Wales -- between the Cambrian and the Silurian, equivalent to the disputed &quot;upper Cambrian-lower Silurian&quot; beds. Each one of these is now known to be characterized by distinct fossil assemblages.

==Disagreement with Darwin==

For one summer of his work in Wales which was to lead to this controversy, Sedgwick made a fateful choice of field assistant: a young Cambridge graduate named [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin had passed his examinations for the [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in January 1831, and began attending Sedgwick's geology lectures, which he found fascinating. That summer, the two men explored the rocks of north Wales; Darwin got a &quot;crash course&quot; in field geology from Sedgwick, an experience that would stand him in good stead over the next five years, on the round-the-world voyage of [[HMS Beagle]]. During this voyage, Darwin sent rocks and fossils from [[South America]] back to Sedgwick, as well as descriptions of the geology of South America. These impressed Sedgwick, who wrote in a letter to Darwin's family: 

He is doing admirably in S. America &amp; has already sent home a Collection above all praise. -- It was the best thing in the world for him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery... 
In November 1835, before Darwin had returned to England, Sedgwick read some of Darwin's work on South American geology to the Geological Society of London. This greatly improved Darwin's reputation as a scientist; he was inducted into the Society shortly after his return. The two stayed friends until Sedgwick's death, but Sedgwick was upset and disappointed by Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. After reading [[The Origin of Species]], Sedgwick candidly wrote to Darwin on [[November 24]], [[1859]]: 

&quot;If I did not think you a good tempered &amp; truth loving man I should not tell you that. . . I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false &amp; grievously mischievous-- You have deserted-- after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth-- the true method of induction. . . &quot;

However despite this difference of opinion, the two men remained friendly until Sedgwick's death.

==Flawed opinions==

Sedgwick's own geological views were generally catastrophic -- he believed that the history of the [[Earth]] had been marked by a series of cataclysmic events which had destroyed much of the Earth's life. In this belief he followed Cuvier, and he was opposed to Charles Lyell's models of slow, gradual geological change and a more or less steady-state Earth. However, Sedgwick was interested in the possibility that at least some of the &quot;catastrophic&quot; changes implied by the rock record might be shown to be gradual. He originally followed his colleague [[William Buckland]] in believing that the uppermost [[Pleistocene]] deposits had been laid down by the Biblical Flood, but retracted this belief after many of these deposits turned out to have been formed by glaciers, not floods. Sedgwick also did not object to evolution, or &quot;development&quot; as such theories were called then, in the broad sense -- to the fact that the life on Earth had changed over time. Nor was he a young-Earth creationist; he believed that the Earth must be extremely old. As Darwin wrote of Sedgwick's lectures, &quot;What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!&quot; 

However, Sedgwick believed in the Divine creation of life over long periods of time, by &quot;a power I cannot imitate or comprehend -- but in which I believe, by a legitimate conclusion of sound reason drawn from the laws of harmonies of nature.&quot; What Sedgwick objected to was the apparent amoral and materialist nature of Darwin's proposed mechanism, natural selection, which he thought degrading to humanity's spiritual aspirations. His letter of November 24 went on to state: 

This view of nature you have stated admirably; tho' admitted by all naturalists &amp; denied by no one of common sense. We all admit development as a fact of history; but how came it about? Here, in language, &amp; still more in logic, we are point blank at issue-- There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly. Tis the crown &amp; glory of organic science that it does thro' final cause, link material to moral. . . You have ignored this link; &amp;, if I do not mistake your meaning, you have done your best in one or two pregnant cases to break it. Were it possible (which thank God it is not) to break it, humanity in my mind, would suffer a damage that might brutalize it--&amp; sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Arthur Koestler.jpg|110px|thumb|Arthur Koestler]]
'''Arthur Koestler''' ([[September 5]], [[1905]], [[Budapest]] &amp;ndash; [[March 3]], [[1983]], [[London]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[polymath]] who became a naturalized [[United Kingdom|British]] subject. He wrote [[journalism]], [[novels]], social [[philosophy]], and books on scientific subjects. He was a [[Communism|Communist]] during much of the 1930s and remained politically active until the 1950s. He wrote a number of popular books, including ''Arrow in the Blue'' (the first volume of his autobiography), ''The Yogi and the Commissar'' (a collection of essays, many dealing with [[Communism]]), ''The Sleepwalkers'' (''A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe''), ''The Act of Creation'', and ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' giving a new theory of the origins of the Jews of Eastern Europe. His most famous work, the novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' about the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Great Purge|purges]] of the 1930s, ranks with [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as a fictional treatment of [[Stalinism]]. He also wrote ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]'' articles.&lt;!--Many number?? I know but one.--&gt;

== Life ==
He was born K√∂sztler Artur (Hungarians put the [[surname]] first) in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] to a [[German language|German-speaking]] Hungarian family of [[Ashkenazi Jews| Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent. His father, Henrik, was an [[industrialist]] and [[inventor]] whose business ideas revealed flawed judgement; for example, he invested for a while in the manufacture of a kind of [[radioactive]] soap. When Artur was 14, his family moved to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. In 1918, Hungary obtained its independence from Austria and flirted for a while with [[Bolshevism]].

Koestler studied [[science]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Vienna]], where he became involved in [[Zionism]]. After completing his studies, he worked as a [[news correspondent]]. From [[1926]] to [[1929]] he lived in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], partly in a ''[[kibbutz]]''. He joined the [[Germany|German]] [[Communist Party]] in [[1931]], but left it after the [[Stalin]]ist purges of [[1938]]. During this period he traveled extensively in the [[Soviet Union]] and climbed [[Mount Ararat]] in [[Turkey]]. In [[Turkmenistan]], he met the black American writer [[Langston Hughes]]. In [[1931]], he was a member of a [[zeppelin]] expedition to the [[North Pole]].

In his memoir ''The Invisible Writing'', Koestler recalls that during the summer of [[1935]] he &quot;wrote about half of a satirical novel called ''[[The Good Soldier ≈†vejk|The Good Soldier Schweik Goes to War Again....]]''. It had been commissioned by [[Willi M√ºnzenberg|Willy M√ºnzenberg]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;the [[Comintern]]'s chief [[propagandist]] in the [[Western world|West]]] ... but was vetoed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] on the grounds of the book's 'pacifist errors'...&quot; (p. 283).

Soon after the outbreak of [[World War II]], the French authorities detained him for several months in a camp for resident aliens at Le Vernet in the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]] mountains. Upon his release, he joined the [[French Foreign Legion]]. He eventually escaped to [[England]] via Morocco and Portugal. In England, he served in the [[British Army]] as a member of the [[British Pioneer Corps]], 1941-42, then worked for the [[BBC]]. He became a [[British subject]] in [[1945]]. He returned to France after the war, where he rubbed shoulders with the set gravitating around [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. One of the characters in de Beauvoir's novel ''The Mandarins'' is believed based on Koestler.

He returned to [[London]] and spent the rest of his life writing and lecturing. He was made a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[1970s]]. In [[1983]], Koestler, suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[leukemia]], committed joint [[suicide]] by taking an overdose of drugs with his third wife Cynthia. He had long been an advocate of voluntary [[euthanasia]], and in [[1981]], had become vice-president of &quot;[[EXIT]]&quot;, a British group campaigning for it. His will endowed the chair of [[parapsychology]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].

===Multilingualism=== 
In addition to his mother tongue [[German language|German]], Koestler became fluent in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[English language|English]], and [[French language|French]], and knew some [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. His biographer [[David Cesarani]] claims there is some evidence that Koestler may have picked up some [[Yiddish]] from his grandfather. Koestler's multilingualism was principally due to his having resided, worked, and/or studied in [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] (pre-independence [[Israel]]), the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], all by 40 years of age.

Though he wrote the bulk of his later work in English, Koestler wrote his best-known novels in three different languages: ''The Gladiators'' in Hungarian, ''Darkness at Noon'' in German (although the original is now lost), and ''Arrival and Departure'' in English. His journalism was written in German, Hebrew, French and English. He claimed to have produced the first Hebrew language [[crossword]] puzzles.

===Women===
Koestler was married to Dorothy Asher (1935-50), Mamaine Paget (1950-52), and Cynthia Jefferies (1965-83). He also had a very short fling with the French writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]], one that may explain the mutual animosity between him and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. David Cesarani claimed that Koestler beat and raped several women, including [[film director]] [[Jill Craigie]]. The resulting protests led to the removal of a bust of Koestler from public display at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Questions have also been raised by his [[suicide pact]] with his last spouse. Although he was [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] at the time, she was apparently healthy, leading some to claim he wrongly persuaded her to take her own life.

==Mixed legacy==
Just as ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' was selling well during the [[Cold War]] of the 40s and 50s, Koestler announced his retirement from [[politics]]. Much of what he wrote thereafter revealed a multidisciplinary thinker whose work anticipated a number of trends by many years. He was among the first to experiment with [[LSD]] (in a laboratory). He also wrote about [[Japan|Japanese]] and [[India|Indian]] mysticism in ''[[The Lotus and the Robot]]'' ([[1960]]). He did not merely arrive at different answers to accepted questions; rather, he tended to ask questions that no one else thought to ask.

This originality resulted in an uneven set of ideas and conclusions.  Some of them, such as his work on creativity (''Insight and Outlook, Act of Creation'') and the history of science (''The Sleepwalkers''), are arguably brilliant and challenge us to readjust our thinking. Some of his other pursuits, such as his interest in the [[paranormal]], his support for [[euthanasia]], his theory of the origin of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] like himself, and his disagreement with [[Darwinism]], are more controversial.

=== Politics ===
Koestler was involved in a number of political causes during his life, from [[Zionism]] and [[communism]] to [[anti-communism]], voluntary [[euthanasia]] and campaigns against [[capital punishment]], particularly [[hanging]]. He was also an early advocate of [[nuclear disarmament]].

=== Journalism ===
Until the bestseller status of ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' made him financially comfortable, Koestler often earned his living as a journalist and foreign correspondent, trading on his ability to write quickly in several languages, and to acquire with facility a working knowledge of a new language. He wrote for a variety of newspapers, including ''Vossische Zeitung'' (science editor) and ''B.Z. am Mittag'' (foreign editor) in the 1920s. In the early 1930s, he worked for the Ullstein publishing group in [[Berlin]] and did freelance writing for the French press. 

While covering the [[Spanish Civil War]], in [[1937]], he was captured and held for several months by the [[Falange|Falangists]] in [[M√°laga]], until the [[United Kingdom|British]] Foreign Office negotiated his release. His ''[[Spanish Testament]]'' records these experiences, which he soon transformed into his classic prison novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''. After his release from Spanish detention, Koestler worked for the ''News Chronicle'', then edited ''Die Zukunft'' with [[Willi M√ºnzenberg]], an anti-Nazi, anti-Stalinist German language paper based in [[Paris]], founded in [[1938]]. During and after [[WWII]], he wrote for a number of English and American papers, including ''The Sunday Telegraph'', on various subjects.

===Science===
During the last 30 years of his life, Koestler wrote extensively on science and scientific practice. The [[Post-Modernism|post-modernist]] scepticism colouring much of this writing tended to alienate most of the scientific community. A case in point is his 1971 book ''The Case of the Midwife Toad'' about the biologist [[Paul Kammerer]], who claimed to find experimental support for [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian inheritance]].

[[Mysticism]] and a fascination with the [[paranormal]] imbued much of his later work, and greatly influenced his personal life. He left a substantial part of his estate to establish the Koestler Institute at the [[University of Edinburgh]] dedicated to the study of [[Parapsychology|paranormal]] phenomena. His ''The Roots of Coincidence'' centered on yet another line of unconventional research by Paul Kammerer, this time his claim of a quantum theory of coincidence or [[synchronicity]], a theory Koestler evaluated in light of the writings of [[Carl Jung]]. More controversial were Koestler's studies of [[levitation]] and [[telepathy]].

===Judaism===
Although a lifelong atheist, Koestler's ancestry was Jewish. His biographer [[David Cesarani]] has claimed that Koestler deliberately disowned his Jewish ancestry.

Koestler's book ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'' advanced the controversial thesis that [[Ashkenazi]] Jews are not descended from the Israelites of antiquity, but from the [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic]] people in the [[Caucasus]] who converted to [[Judaism]] in the [[8th century]] and were later forced to move westwards into current [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]. Koestler stated that part of his intent in writing ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' was to defuse [[anti-Semitism]] by undermining the identification of European Jews with Biblical Jews, with the hope of rendering anti-Semitic epithets such as &quot;Christ killer&quot; inapplicable. Ironically,  Koestler's thesis that Ashkenazi Jews are not Semitic has become an important claim of many anti-Semitic groups. Some [[Palestinian]]s have eagerly seized upon this thesis, believing that to identify most Jews as non-Semites seriously undermines their historical claim to the [[land of Israel]]. The thesis of ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' has since been criticized. To date, the genetic evidence has been inconclusive. Some researchers claim to find a Middle Eastern genetic element in virtually all Ashkenazim. Others note both Turkic words and Turkic genetic markers in these populations.  But the usefulness of genetic markers in determining ancestry can be problematic; for instance, Ashkenazim also display a high level of similarity to the genetic markers of [[Khoisan]] [[Bushmen]] in Southern Africa.  A thorough review of the scientific literature can be found at [http://www.khazaria.com/ Khazaria.com].

When Koestler resided in Palestine during the 1920s, he lived on a [[kibbutz]], an experience forming the basis of his unfinished ''Thieves in the Night''.  His view of [[Israel]] was that it would never be destroyed, short of a second [[Shoah]]. He supported the statehood of Israel, but opposed a diaspora Jewish culture. In an interview published in the ''London Jewish Chronicle'' around the time of Israel's founding, Koestler asserted that all Jews should either migrate to Israel, or assimilate completely into their local cultures. Koestler was also no dogmatic Zionist; for instance, he proposed that Israel drop the [[Hebrew alphabet]] for the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]].

In his younger days, the [[singer]] [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was an avid reader of Koestler. His band of the time, [[The Police]] were to name one of their albums ''[[Ghost in the Machine]]'' after one of Koestler's books. The title ''[[Synchronicity (album)|Synchronicity]]'' was also inspired by Koestler's ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]'', which mentions [[Carl Jung]]'s [[synchronicity|theory]] of the same name. Koestler knew little about the burgeoning [[New Wave music]] scene, and is alleged to have said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Look at this. Did you ever see a magazine called the ''New Musical Express''? It turns out there is a pop group called [[The Police]] - I don't know why they are called that, presumably to distinguish them from the punks - and they've made an album of my essay ''The Ghost in the Machine''. I didn't know anything about it until my clipping agency sent me a review of the record. &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The [[cyberpunk]] [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' was also inspired by Koestler's ''The Ghost in the Machine''.

{{Five oceans}}
The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is [[Earth]]'s second-largest [[ocean]], covering approximately one-fifth of its surface. The ocean's name, derived from [[Greek mythology]], means the &quot;[[Sea]] of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]&quot;.

This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by [[Equatorial Counter Current|equatorial counter current]]s at about 8¬∞ north [[latitude]]. Bounded by the [[Americas]] on the west and [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the [[Arctic Ocean]] on the north and the [[Drake Passage]] on the south. An artificial connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is also provided by the [[Panama Canal]].  On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the [[Indian Ocean]] is the 20¬∞ east meridian, running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]].  The Atlantic is separated from the [[Arctic Ocean]] by a line from [[Greenland]] to northwestern [[Iceland]] and then from northeastern Iceland to southernmost tip of [[Spitsbergen]] and then to [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] in northern [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/01_GlobOcToday/03_GeopolOc/s23_1953.pdf ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''].  International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ireland-AtlanticOceanwithAranIsland.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the west coast of [[Ireland]] on a fair day.]]
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about [[1 E14 m¬≤|106,400,000]] [[square kilometre]]s (41,100,000 [[square mile]]s); without them, it has an area of [[1 E13 m¬≤|82,400,000 square kilometres]] (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is [[1 E15 m¬≥|354,700,000]] [[cubic kilometre]]s (85,100,000 [[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).

The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,332 [[metre]]s (10,932 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft).  The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The width of the Atlantic varies from [[1 E6 m|2,848]] [[kilometre]]s (1,770 [[mile|miles]]) between Brazil and [[Liberia]] to about [[1 E6 m|4,830 kilometes]] (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.

The Atlantic Ocean has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], and [[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian]]-[[Greenland Sea]]. Islands in the Atlantic Ocean include [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Rockall]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], the [[Azores]], the [[Madeira Islands]], the [[Canaries]], the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, [[Sao Tome e Principe]], [[Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]], the [[West Indies]], [[Ascension Island|Ascension]], [[Saint Helena (Britain)|St. Helena]], [[Trindade Island|Trindade]], [[Martin Vaz]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[South Georgia Island]].
[[Image:Atlantic_Ocean.png|right|Atlantic Ocean]]
==Ocean bottom==
The principal feature of the bottom [[topography]] of the Atlantic Ocean is a great submarine mountain range called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately 58¬∞ south latitude, reaching a maximum width of about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi). A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water over the ridge is less than 2,700 metres (8,900 ft) in most places, and several mountain peaks rise above the water, forming islands. The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the Walvis Ridge. 

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|trough]]s with depths averaging between 3,700 and 5,500 metres (12,000 and 18,000 ft). Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat, although numerous [[seamount]]s and some [[guyot]]s exist. Several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor. The Puerto Rico Trench, in the North Atlantic, is the deepest. The [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of Canada. In the south Atlantic, the [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of 8,428 metres (27,651 ft). A third major trench, the [[Romanche Trench]], is located near the equator and reaches a depth of about 7,454 metres (24,455 ft). The shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography. In addition, a number of deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of terrigenous, pelagic, and authigenic material. Terrigenous deposits consist of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea. These materials are largely found on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts. Pelagic deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerinida|Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 60 metres to 3,300 metres (200 ft to 11,000 ft), they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling. Authigenic deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where [[sediment]]ation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits.

==Water characteristics==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Capespearnew.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Atlantic Ocean at [[Cape Spear]], Newfoundland]] --&gt;
The [[salinity]] of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator, in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25¬∞ north latitude. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than ‚àí2&amp;nbsp;¬∞[[Celsius|C]] to 29&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (28&amp;nbsp;¬∞[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 84&amp;nbsp;¬∞F). &lt;!-- less than 2 is not ‚àí2, but assuming less than -2 intended, degree signs butt to letter with space from number --&gt; Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7&amp;nbsp;¬∞C to 8&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (13&amp;nbsp;¬∞F to 15&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the [[Sargasso Sea]], in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average.  The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]], and is also the spawning ground for the [[European eel]].

Due to the [[Coriolis effect]], water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter clockwise. The South [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-[[diel|diurnal]]; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40¬∞ north some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[Image:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|frame|right|Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Ocean ‚Äî areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind ‚Äî create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.]]

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the oceans' great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The [[Gulf Stream]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks]] area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. [[tropical cyclone|Hurricane]]s develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History and economy==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the [[Southern Ocean]]. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, [[Pangaea]], were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The [[Vikings]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Christopher Columbus]] were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as [[transatlantic]] trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]].

The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major &quot;[[transatlantic]]&quot; transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]]. The most productive areas include the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland]], the shelf area off [[Nova Scotia]], [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the Bahama Banks, the waters around [[Iceland]], the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the [[North Sea]], and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.

*In [[1858]], the first [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid by [[Cyrus Field]].
*In [[1919]], the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
*Later in [[1919]], a British airplane piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from [[Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]].
*In [[1921]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an [[airship]].
*In [[1922]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an [[airship]].
*The first transatlantic [[telephone]] call was made on [[January 7]], 1927.
*In [[1927]], [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). 
*After rowing for 81 days and 2,962 miles, on [[December 3]], [[1999]] [[Tori Murden]] became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by [[rowboat]] alone when she reached [[Guadeloupe]] from the [[Canary Islands]].

'''Climate:'''
Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the [[Caribbean Sea]] or up the east coast of North America; hurricanes can occur from May to December, but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.

==Terrain==
The surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and [[Baltic Sea]] from October to June. There is a clockwise warm-water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic. The ocean floor is dominated by the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]].

===Elevation extremes===

===Natural resources===
[[Petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], marine mammals ([[seal (mammal)|seal]]s and [[whale]]s), sand and gravel aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, polymetallic nodules, precious stones

===Natural hazards===
[[Iceberg]]s are common in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and the [[Madeira Islands]]. Ships are subject to [[superstructure#Engineering concept|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in extreme northern Atlantic from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September. So can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents, due to unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but coastguard records do not support this belief.

== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. Drift net fishing is killing [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern [[Brazil]], and eastern [[Argentina]], oil pollution in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]], and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

== Notes on geography ==
Major chokepoints include the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the [[Panama Canal]]; strategic straits include the [[Strait of Dover]], [[Straits of Florida]], [[Mona Passage]], The Sound ([[Oresund]]), and [[Windward Passage]]; the [[Equator]] divides the Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean (previously known as the [[Ethiopic Ocean]]). During the [[Cold War]] the so called [[Greenland]]-[[Iceland]]-[[United Kingdom|UK]] (GIUK) Gap was a major strategic concern, the seabed in that area was laid with extensive [[hydrophone]] systems to track Soviet [[submarine]]s.

'''Arthur Schopenhauer''' ([[February 22]], [[1788]] &amp;ndash; [[September 21]], [[1860]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. He is most famous for his work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.  He is commonly known for having espoused a sort of philosophical [[pessimism]] that saw life as being essentially [[evil]], futile, and full of suffering. However, upon closer inspection, in accordance with [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern thought]], especially that of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], he saw [[salvation]], deliverance, or escape from suffering in [[aesthetic]] [[contemplation]], [[sympathy]] for others, and [[ascetic]] living.  His ideas profoundly influenced the fields of [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[music]], and [[literature]].

== Life ==
Schopenhauer was born in [[1788]] in [[Sztutowo]], Poland, near [[Gda≈Ñsk]]. He was the son of Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer and [[Johanna Schopenhauer]], a middle class mercantile family of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] heritage, although they had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism. Indeed, the name Arthur was selected by his father especially because it was the same in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. His parents were both from the city, and Johanna was an author as well. After the city was annexed by [[Prussia]] during the second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] in [[1793]], the Schopenhauer family fled to [[Hamburg]]; in [[1805]] Schopenhauer's father died, possibly by [[suicide]], and Johanna moved to [[Weimar]]. Because of a promise to pursue a business career, Schopenhauer remained in Hamburg. His disgust of this career, however, drove him away to join his mother in Weimar after only a year. He never got along with his mother; when the writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who was a friend of Johanna Schopenhauer, told her that he thought her son was destined for great things, Johanna objected: she had never heard there could be ''two'' geniuses in a single family.

Schopenhauer studied at the [[Georg August University of G√∂ttingen|University of G√∂ttingen]] and was awarded a PhD from the [[University of Jena]].  In [[1820]], Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[University of Berlin]]; it was there that his opposition to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] began. 

While in Berlin, Schopenhauer became involved in a consuming lawsuit from a Caroline Marquet. She asked for damages from him, a man of independent means, on the basis that she had been injured when Schopenhauer allegedly pushed her. Marquet had noisily attracted Schopenhauer's attention. Then, Marquet's companion witnessed her as being prostrate outside of his apartment. Marquet claimed that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway. In this manner, she succeeded in gaining, through the court, a portion of Schopenhauer's limited wealth; he had to make payments for many years. His reputation was permanently damaged by her legal machination.

Schopenhauer's health deteriorated during the year of [[1860]]. He died of [[natural causes]] on [[September 21]] of the same year at the age of 72. 

Schopenhauer called himself a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] and despised Hegel. He formulated a [[philosophical pessimism|pessimistic]] [[philosophy]] that gained importance and support after the failure of the German and Austrian [[revolution]]s of [[1848]].

== Philosophy ==
Schopenhauer's starting point was [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s division of the universe into [[phenomenon]] and [[noumenon]], claiming that the noumenon was the same as that in us which we call [[will (philosophy)|Will]]. It is the inner content and the driving force of the world. For Schopenhauer, human will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought, and, in a parallel sense, will is said to be prior to being.  In solving/alleviating the fundamental problems of life, Schopenhauer was rare among philosophers in considering [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] less important (or less effective) than [[art]], certain types of charitable practice (&quot;loving kindness&quot;, in his terms), and certain forms of religious discipline; Schopenhauer concluded that discursive thought (such as philosophy and logic) could neither touch nor transcend the nature of desire&amp;mdash; i.e., the will.  In ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Schopenhauer posited that humans living in the [[realm of objects]] are living in the [[realm of desire]], and thus are eternally tormented by that desire (his idea of the role of desire in life is similar to that of [[Vedanta]] [[Hinduism]] and Buddhism, and Schopenhauer draws attention to these similarities himself).

While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

{{Quotation|Philosophy... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.|Arthur Schopenhauer|''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. i, pg. 106., E.F.J. Payne Translation}} 

{{Quotation|This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.|Arthur Schopenhauer|''World as Will and Representation'', vol. i, pg. 273, E.F.J. Payne Translation}}

Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian ''noumenon'' (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what we call our will deserves some explanation.  The noumenon was what Kant called the ''Ding an Sich'', the &quot;Thing in Itself&quot;, the reality that is the foundation of our [[sense|sensory]] and [[mind|mental]] representations of an external world; in Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena.  Schopenhauer's assertion that what we call our will is the same as this ''noumenon'' might at first instance strike some as oddly as [[Heraclitus]]'s revelation that everything is made out of [[fire]]. 

But Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical [[philosophical skepticism]] of [[David Hume]] and his fellow [[British Empiricists]], who claimed that as far as we could tell there was [[solipsism|no outside reality]] beyond our mental representations of it.  Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission.  There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception. It is our own body. 

We know our [[human anatomy|human bodies]] have [[boundary|boundaries]], and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do.  Though we seldom think of our bodies as physical objects, we know even before reflection that it shares some of their properties.  We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck.  We know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own bodies, we would obtain similar results.  We know this even if we do not understand the [[physics]] involved.  

We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena.  Yet, our consciousness is not commensurate with our body.  Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion.  We usually are not aware of our [[lung]]s' breath, or our [[heart]]beat, unless our attention is called to it.  Our ability to control either is limited.  Our [[kidney]]s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose.  Few of us have any idea what our [[liver]]s are doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys.  The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs.  These organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and has limited power over.   

When Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name &quot;will,&quot; what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will.  We cannot ''prove'' that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning.  Through will, we know&amp;mdash;without thinking&amp;mdash; that the world can stimulate us.  We suffer fear, or desire.  These states arise involuntarily.  They arise prior to reflection.  They arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay.  The rational mind is for Schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion.  That stream is will; and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality that lies beyond mere phenomena.  It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with what we call our will.

Also, Schopenhauer's philosophy could be considered as [[panpsychism]] and [[solipsism]], and in some way [[Gnosticism|gnostic]].

== Psychology ==
Schopenhauer was perhaps even more influential in his treatment of man's [[mind]] than he was in the realm of [[philosophy]].

Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of [[love]].  But Schopenhauer addressed it, and related concepts, forthrightly.

:&quot;We should be surprised that a matter that generally plays such an important part in the life of man [love] has hitherto been almost entirely disregarded by philosophers, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&quot;

He gave a name to a [[force]] within man which he felt invariably had precedence over reason: the [[Will to Live]] (Wille zum Leben), defined as an inherent [[drive]] within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive and to [[reproduce]].

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man's [[psyche]] and dramatically shaping the [[world]]:

:&quot;The ultimate aim of all love affairs ...is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it.&quot;
:&quot;What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation...&quot;

These ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s [[Will to Power]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious]] [[mind]].

== Aesthetics ==
:''See main article: [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]]''

This wild and powerful drive to reproduce, however, caused [[suffering]] and [[pain]] in the world.  For Schopenhauer, one way to escape the suffering inherent in a world of Will was through [[art]].

Through art, Schopenhauer thought, the thinking subject could be jarred out of their limited, individual [[perspective]] to feel a sense of the [[universal (metaphysics)]] directly &amp;mdash; the &quot;universal&quot; in question, of course, was the will.  The contest of personal [[desire]] with a world that was, by nature, inimical to its satisfaction is inevitably tragical; therefore, the highest place in art was given to [[tragedy]].  [[Music]] was also given a special status in [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]] as it did not rely upon the medium of representation to communicate a sense of the universal.  Schopenhauer believed the function of art to be a [[meditation]] on the unity of [[human nature]], and an attempt to either demonstrate or directly communicate to the [[audience]] a certain [[existential]] [[angst]] for which most forms of entertainment &amp;mdash; including bad art &amp;mdash; only provided a distraction.  A wide range of authors (from [[Thomas Hardy]] to [[Woody Allen]]) and artists have been influenced by this system of [[aesthetics]], and in the 20th century this area of Schopenhauer's work garnered more attention and praise than any other.

According to Daniel Albright (2005), &quot;Schopenhauer thought that [[music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself.&quot;

==Politics==
Schopenhauer's [[politics]] were, for the most part, a much-diminished echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''[[Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik]]'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''; ethics also occupies about one fourth of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'').  In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralimpomena]]'' and ''[[Manuscript Remains]]'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government.  What was essential, he thought, was that the state should &quot;leave each man free to work out his own salvation&quot;, and so long as government was thus limited, he would &quot;prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats&quot; &amp;mdash; i.e., a monarch.  Schopenhauer did, however, share the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state violence, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species.  Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes prideful boasts of how little attention he had paid &quot;to political affairs of [his] day&quot;.  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of &quot;minding not the times but the eternities&quot;.

== Schopenhauer on women ==
Schopenhauer is also famous for his essay &quot;On Women&quot; (''√úber die Weiber''), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called &quot;Teutonico-Christian stupidity&quot; on female affairs. He claimed that &quot;woman is by nature meant to obey&quot;, and opposed [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s poem in honor of women, ''W√ºrde der Frauen''. The essay does give two compliments however: that &quot;women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are&quot; and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.  However, the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue.    

The ultra-intolerant view of women contrasts with Schopenhauer's generally liberal views on other social issues: he was strongly against [[taboo]]s on issues like [[suicide]] and [[masochism]] and condemned the treatment of African [[slavery|slave]]s.  This [[polemic]] on female nature has since been fiercely attacked as [[misogyny|misogynistic]]. However, he did not hold a universally negative opinion of women in particular; one should note that Schopenhauer had a very high opinion of [[Madame de Guyon]], whose writings and biography he highly recommended.

In any case, the controversial writing has influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] to [[19th century]] [[feminism|feminists]].  While Schopenhauer's hostility to women may tell us more about his [[biography]] than about philosophy, his [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] in the [[twentieth century]].

==Schopenhauer on homosexuality==
Schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of [[Greek philosophy]] to address the subject of male [[homosexuality]].  In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' ([[1856]]), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the &quot;Metaphysics of Sexual Love.&quot;  In it, he develops the idea that since only mature men and fully adult but pre-[[menopause|menopausal]] women are capable of bearing healthy children, in early adolescence and in late middle age the sexual appetite is susceptible of being turned towards another channel.  

While there may again be more [[autobiography]] than analysis in this hypothesis, it is consistent with the general tenor of Schopenhauer's thought, which gives the Will in nature the position of setting an agenda for individual lives.  It is also one of the first attempts at portraying homosexuality as a natural phenomenon, acknowledging its existence in every culture, and seeking to explain its appearance even in those cultures whose moralities sharply condemn homosexual behaviour.

==Schopenhauer on Hegel==
Schopenhauer seems to have disliked just about everything concerning his contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. The following quotation from ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' (page 15-16) is quite famous:

{{Quotation|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a [[pseudophilosophy|pseudo-philosophy]] paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.&lt;p&gt;
Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus [...] scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called [[Phenomenology of the Mind]], without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], I should be no less right.|Arthur Schopenhauer|''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' (page 15-16)}}

But Schopenhauer had good reason to mistrust the writings of Hegel. In his &quot;Foreword to 
the first edition&quot; of his work [[Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik]], Schopenhauer 
had found Hegel to have fallen prey to the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy. 

Schopenhauer's critique of Hegel is most certainly directed at his perception that Hegel's works use deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous [[jargon]] and [[neologism]]s, and that they contained castles of abstraction that sounded impressive but ultimately contained no verifiable content.  He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with search for philosophical truth.  Although Schopenhauer may have appeared vain in his constant attacks on [[Hegel]], they were not necessarily devoid of merit: the [[Right Hegelians]] interpreted  Hegel as seeing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.

==Common Misconceptions==
Many are put off Schopenhauer by descriptions of him as an obstinate and arrogant man, who did not lead the ascetic life that he glorified in his work.  The idea that he made resignation into a command to virtue is inaccurate, as he was merely trying to explain asceticism in terms of [[metaphysics]].  He does refer to the asceticism as a state of &quot;inner peace and cheerfulness&quot;, but he also clearly states that he was not trying to recommend the denial of the will above the affirmation of the will.  Furthermore, the call to asceticism was supposed to come to select individuals as knowledge all of a sudden, rather than being a virtue that can be taught. &quot;In general,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses.&quot; (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol.I, ¬ß 68)

[[Nietzsche]] seems to have made this misinterpretation, leading some people to a distorted view of Schopenhauer.  The following sentence from ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'' is often quoted:

{{Quotation|He has interpreted art, heroism, genius, beauty, great sympathy, knowledge, the will to truth, and tragedy, in turn, as consequences of &quot;negation&quot; or of the &quot;will's&quot; need to negate.|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]|''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]''}}

Schopenhauer did see all these things as means to a more peaceful and enlightened way of life, but none of them were &quot;denial of the will-to-live&quot;.  Only asceticism is referred to in that way.  [[Nietzsche]] also claimed that Schopenhauer did not recognise that suffering had a redemptive quality, yet his recognition of this seems blatantly clear in part 4 of ''The World as Will and Representation''.

Also, his identification of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] with the Kantian &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; has been misunderstood.  [[Kant]] defined things-in-themselves as being beyond comprehension and that no-one could know the inner nature of a material thing.  It is sometimes thought that Schopenhauer denied this, but he did not.  What he did assert was that one could know things about the thing-in-itself.  For example, you can know that the will is a striving force, that it is endless, that it causes suffering, that it will produce boredom if unoccupied, etc.  However, he did not say that you could directly know the will.  In addition, it has sometimes been criticised that he never defined the will, but he explained that it could not be fully defined.

==Influence==

}}{{about|the country|the prison|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]]}}
'''Angola''' is a country in southwestern [[Africa]] bordering [[Namibia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Zambia]], and with a west coast along the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[exclave]] province [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] has a border with [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]]. A former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony, it has considerable natural resources, among which oil and diamonds are the most relevant.  The country is nominally a [[democracy]] and is formally named the '''Republic of Angola''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Rep√∫blica de Angola'', [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[IPA]]: /{{IPA| Å…õ.'pu.Œ≤li.k…ê d…® …êÃÉ.'…£…î.l…ê}}/).

==Origin and history of the name==

The name '''Angola''' is a Portuguese derivation of the [[Bantu language|Bantu]] word N‚Äôgola, being the title of the native rulers of the Quimbundos Kingdom in the [[16th century]], at the time of colonization by the Portuguese.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Angola]]''

[[Image:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|left|Shows Queen Nzinga in peace negotiations with the portuguese governor in Luanda, 1657.]]
The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They were largely replaced by Bantu tribes during [[Bantu]] [[human migration|migrations]]. In present-day Angola [[Portugal]] settled in 1483 at the river Congo, where the [[Kongo Empire|Kongo]] State, [[Ndongo]] and [[Lunda]] existed. The Kongo State stretched from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. Portugal established in 1575 a Portuguese colony at [[Luanda]] based on the slave trade. The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip throughout the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars. They formed the colony of Angola. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] occupied Luanda from 1641-48, providing a boost for anti-Portuguese states. 

In 1648 Portugal retook Luanda and initiated a process of military conquest of the Kongo and Ndongo states that ended with Portuguese victory in 1671. Full Portuguese administrative control of the interior didn't occur until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1951 the colony was restyled as an overseas province, also called Portuguese West Africa. When Portugal refused a decolonization process three independence movements emerged: 
* the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (''Movimento Popular de Liberta√ß√£o de Angola'' MPLA), with a base among [[Kimbundu]] and the mixed-race intelligentsia of Luanda, and links to communist parties in Portugal and the [[Eastern Bloc]]; 
* the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (''Frente Nacional de Liberta√ß√£o de Angola'', FNLA), with an ethnic base in the Bakongo region of the north and links to the [[United States]] and the [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] regime in [[Zaire]]; and
* the [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola]] (''Uni√£o Nacional para a Independ√™ncia Total de Angola'', UNITA), led by [[Jonas Savimbi|Jonas Malheiro Savimbi]] with an ethnic and regional base in the Ovimbundu heartland in the center of the country. 

After a 14 year independence guerrilla war, and the overthrow of fascist Portugal's government by a military coup, Angola's nationalist parties began to negotiate for independence in January 1975.  Independence was to be declared in November 1975.  Almost immediately, a [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] broke out between MPLA, UNITA and FNLA, exacerbated by foreign intervention.  South African troops struck an alliance of convenience with UNITA and invaded Angola in August 1975 to ensure that there would be no interference (by a newly independent Angolan state) in [[Namibia]], which was then under South African control (Hodges, 2001, 11). Cuban troops came to the support of the MPLA in October 1975, enabling them to control the capital, [[Luanda]], and hold off the South African forces.  The MPLA declared itself to be the de facto government of the country when independence was formally declared in November, with [[Agostinho Neto]] as the first President.  

In 1976, the FNLA was defeated by a combination of MPLA and [[Cuba|Cuban]] troops, leaving the Marxist MPLA and UNITA (backed by the United States and South Africa) to fight for power.  

The conflict raged on, fuelled by the geopolitics of the Cold War and by the ability of both parties to access Angola's natural resources.  The MPLA drew upon the revenues of off-shore oil resources, while UNITA accessed alluvial diamonds that were easily smuggled through the region's very porous borders (LeBillon, 1999).

In 1991, the factions agreed to turn Angola into a multiparty state, but after the current president [[Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos]] of MPLA won UN supervised elections, UNITA claimed there was fraud and fighting broke out again.

A 1994 peace accord ([[Lusaka]] protocol) between the government and UNITA provided for the integration of former UNITA [[insurgent]]s into the government. A national unity government was installed in 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of people homeless. President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos suspended the regular functioning of democratic instances due to the conflict.

On [[February 22]] [[2002]], Jonas Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, was shot dead and a cease-fire was reached by the two factions. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party. Although the political situation of the country seems to be normalizing, president dos Santos still hasn't allowed regular democratic processes to take place. Among Angola's major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of [[minefield]]s, and the actions of guerrilla movements fighting for the independence of the northern exclave of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] ([[Frente para a Liberta√ß√£o do Enclave de Cabinda]]).

Angola, like many sub-Saharan nations, is subject to periodic outbreaks of infectious diseases. In April 2005, Angola was in the midst of an [[Marburg virus#2004-2005 outbreak in Angola|outbreak]] of the [[Marburg virus]] which was rapidly becoming the worst outbreak of a haemorrhagic fever in recorded history, with over 237 deaths recorded out of 261 reported cases, and having spread to 7 out of the 18 provinces as of [[April 19]], [[2005]].

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Angola]]''

The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Prime Minister (currently [[Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos]]) and Council of Ministers. Currently, political power is concentrated in the Presidency. The Council of Ministers, composed of all government ministers and vice ministers, meets regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has never been constituted despite statutory authorization.

The 27 year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically Luanda (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

The president has announced the government's intention to hold elections in 2006. These elections would be the first since 1992 and would serve to elect both a new president and a new National Assembly.

==Geography==
[[Image:Angola map.png|thumb|300px|Map of Angola]]
[[Image:LuandaJuin2005-1-br.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Luanda]], the Angolan capital]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Angola]]''

Angola is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, [[Zambia]] to the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north-east, and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] also borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the north. Angola's capital, [[Luanda]], lies on the Atlantic coast in the north-west of the country.

Angola is divided into an arid coastal strip stretching from Namibia to Luanda; a wet, interior highland; a dry savanna in the interior south and southeast; and rain forest in the north and in Cabinda. The [[Zambezi River]] and several tributaries of the Congo River have their sources in Angola.

===Exclaves and enclaves===
The [[exclave]] province of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] borders with both the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The latter's only oceanic access, 60 kilometres (37 [[mile|mi]]) in width, divides Angola from Cabinda. The population stands at around 300,000, two-thirds of which inhabit the surroundings in a generally stable state on Congolese and Zairian territory. The Angolan central government has yet to put a definitive end to the Cabindese secessionist movement.

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Angola]]''

Angola is an economy in disarray because of a quarter century of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.  Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government.  Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, millions of land mines remain, rural violence is a possibility, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the country's food must still be imported. Despite the increase in the pace of civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note. Expanded oil production brightens prospects for 2000, but internal strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector. With the advent of peace in 2002 a strategic partnership with China is set in motion, so huge investments by Chinese companies are now in place, especially in the construction sector and more recently in the metallurgical sector.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Angola]]''

Angola has three main ethnic groups, each speaking a Bantu language: [[Ovimbundu]] 37%, [[Kimbundu]] 25%, and [[Bakongo]] 13%. Other groups include [[Chokwe]] (or [[Lunda]]), [[Ganguela]], [[Nhaneca-Humbe]], [[Ambo]], [[Herero]], and [[Xindunga]]. In addition, ''[[mesti√ßo]]s'' (Angolans of mixed European and African family origins) amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. Portuguese make up the largest non-Angolan population, with at least 30,000 (though many native-born Angolans can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law). In [[1975]], 250,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers settled Angola to help the MPLA forces to fight for its independence. These Cubans are of European and [[Asia]]n (mostly [[Chinese Cuban| Chinese]] descent, while others include those of pure [[Afro-Cuban|African]] and [[mulatto]] descent, who has ancestors in Angola. But in [[1989]], almost all Cubans went out of the country after a peace agreement has been signed between Angola, Cuba, and [[South Africa]]. Portuguese is both the official and predominant language, spoken in the homes of about two-thirds of the population, and as a secondary language by many more. Cubans speak [[Spanish language]], but almost none of their descendants speak it.

The great majority of the inhabitants are of Bantu stock with some admixture in the Congo district. In the south-east are various tribes of Bushmen. The best-known of the Bantu tribes are the Ba-Kongo (Ba-Fiot), who dwell chiefly in the north, and the [[Abunda]] (Mbunda, Ba-Bundo), who occupy the central part of the province, which takes its name from the Ngola tribe of Abunda. Another of these tribes, the Bangala, living on the west bank of the upper Kwango, must not be confused with the Bangala of the middle Congo. In the Abunda is a considerable strain of Portuguese blood. The Ba-Lunda inhabit the Lunda district. Along the upper Kunene and in other districts of the plateau are settlements of Boers, the Boer population being about 2000. In the coast towns the majority of the white inhabitants are Portuguese. The Mushi-Kongo and other divisions of the Ba-Kongo retain curious traces of the Christianity professed by them in the 16th and 17th centuries and possibly later. Crucifixes are used as potent fetish charms or as symbols of power passing down from chief to chief; whilst every native has a &quot;Santu&quot; or Christian name and is dubbed dom or dona. [[Fetishism]] is the prevailing religion throughout the province. The dwelling-places of the natives are usually small huts of the simplest construction, used chiefly as sleeping apartments; the day is spent in an open space in front of the hut protected from the sun by a roof of palm or other leaves. Despite all that, Catholicism remains the dominant religion, although recently an increasing number of churches are claiming more followers, particularly evangelicals.

[[Angola]] is located on the [[South Atlantic]] Coast of West [[Africa]] between [[Namibia]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. It also is bordered by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]] to the east. The country is divided into an arid coastal strip stretching from Namibia to [[Luanda]]; a wet, interior highland; a dry [[savanna]] in the interior south and southeast; and [[rain forest]] in the north and in [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The [[Zambezi River]] and several tributaries of the [[Congo River]] have their sources in Angola. The coastal strip is tempered by the cool [[Benguela]] current, resulting in a climate similar to coastal [[Peru]] or [[Baja California]]. There is a short rainy season lasting from February to April. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are mild. The interior highlands have a mild climate with a rainy season from November through April followed by a cool dry season from May to October. Elevations generally range from 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m). The far north and Cabinda enjoy rain throughout much of the year. 

The coast is for the most part flat, with occasional low cliffs and bluffs of red [[sandstone]]. There is but one deep inlet of the sea - [[Great Fish Bay]] (or [[Ba√≠a dos Tigres]]). Farther north are [[Port Alexander]], [[Little Fish Bay]] and [[Lobito Bay]], while shallower bays are numerous. Lobito Bay has water sufficient to allow large ships to unload close inshore. The coast plain extends inland for a distance varying from 30 to 100 miles (48 to 165 km). This region is in general sparsely watered and somewhat sterile. The approach to the great central plateau of Africa is marked by a series of irregular terraces. This intermediate mountain belt is covered with luxuriant vegetation. Water is fairly abundant, though in the dry season obtainable only by digging in the sandy beds of the rivers. The plateau has an altitude ranging from 4000 to 6000 ft (1,200 to 1,800 m). It consists of well-watered, wide, rolling plains, and low hills with scanty vegetation. In the east the tableland falls away to the basins of the Congo and Zambezi, to the south it merges into a barren sandy [[desert]]. A large number of rivers make their way westward to the sea; they rise, mostly, in the mountain belt, and are unimportant, the only two of any size being the Kwanza and the Kunene, separately noticed. The mountain chains which form the edge of the plateau, or diversify its surface, run generally parallel to the coast, as [[Tala Mugongo]] (4400 ft., 1350 m), [[Chella]] and [[Vissecua]] (5250 ft. to 6500 ft. or 1500 to 2000 m). In the district of [[Benguela]] are the highest points of the province, viz. [[Loviti]] (7780 ft., 2370 m), in 12¬∞ 5' S., and [[Mt. Elonga]] (7550 ft., 2300 m). South of the Kwanza is the volcanic mountain [[Caculo-Cabaza]] (3300 ft., 1000 m). From the tableland the [[Kwango]] and many other streams flow north to join the [[Kasai River]] (one of the largest affluents of the Congo), which in its upper course forms for fully 300 mi (490 km). the boundary between Angola and the Congo State. In the south-east part of the province the rivers belong either to the [[Zambezi]] system, or, like the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], drain to [[Lake Ngami]].

== Geology ==

The rock formations of Angola are met with in three distinct regions:

# the [[littoral]] zone,
# the median zone formed by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast,
# the central plateau.

The central plateau consists of ancient [[crystalline rock]]s with [[granite]]s overlain by [[unfossiliferous]] sandstones and conglomerates of [[Paleozoic]] age. The outcrops are largely hidden under [[laterite]]. The median zone is composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some Palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks. The [[littoral]] zone contains the only [[fossiliferous]] strata. These are of [[Tertiary Age|Tertiary]] and [[Cretaceous]] ages, the latter rocks resting on a reddish sandstone of older date. The Cretaceous rocks of the Dombe Grande region (near Benguella) are of [[Albian age]] and belong to the ''[[Acanthoceras mamillari]]'' zone. The beds containing ''[[Schloenbachia inflata]]'' are referable to the [[Gault]]. Rocks of Tertiary age are met with at Dombe Grande, Mossamedes and near Loanda. The sandstones with [[gypsum]], [[copper]] and [[sulfur]] of Dombe are doubtfully considered to be of [[Triassic]] age. Recent eruptive rocks, mainly [[basalt]]s, form a line of hills almost bare of vegetation between Benguella and Mossamedes. Nepheline basalts and [[liparite]]s occur at Dombe Grande. The presence of [[gum copal]] in considerable quantities in the superficial rocks is characteristic of certain regions.

== Climate ==

Like the rest of tropical Africa, Angola experiences distinct, alternating rainy and dry seasons. It is semiarid in South and along coast to Luanda; North has cool, dry season (May to October) and hot, rainy season (November to April).  In the interior, above 3300 ft. (1000 m), the temperature and rainfall decrease.  The plateau climate is healthy and invigorating.  The mean annual temperature at [[S√£o Salvador do Congo]] is 22.2¬∞ C (72.5¬∞ F); at [[Loanda]], 23.3¬∞ C (74.3¬∞ F); and at [[Caconda]], 19.5¬∞ C (67.2¬∞ F).  The climate is greatly influenced by the prevailing [[wind]]s, which arc W., S.W. and S.S.W.  Two seasons are distinguished - the cool, from June to September; and the rainy, from October to May.  The heaviest [[rainfall]] occurs in April, and is accompanied by violent storms.

== Terrain ==
Angola has three principal natural regions: the coastal lowland, characterized by low plains and terraces; hills and mountains, rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment; and an area of high plains, called the high plateau (planalto), which extends eastward from the escarpment. The highest point in Angola is [[Morro de Moco]], at 2,620 m.

===Coastal lowland===
The coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces. This region varies in width from about 25 kilometers near Benguela to more than 150 kilometers in the Cuanza River Valley just south of Angola's capital, Luanda, and is markedly different from Angola's highland mass. The Atlantic Ocean's cold, northwardflowing Benguela Current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast, making the region relatively arid or nearly so south of Benguela (where it forms the northern extension of the Namib Desert), and quite dry even in its northern reaches. Even where, as around Luanda, the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters, it is not uncommon for the rains to fail. Given this pattern of precipitation, the far south is marked by sand dunes, which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast. Portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush.

===Hills and mountains===
The belt of hills and mountains parallels the coast at distances ranging from 20 kilometers to 100 kilometers inland. The Cuanza River divides the zone into two parts. The northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of 500 meters, with crests as high as 1,000 meters to 1,800 meters. South of the Cuanza River, the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment, extending from a point east of Luanda and running south through Namibia. The escarpment reaches 2,400 meters at its highest point, southeast of the town of Sumbe, and is steepest in the far south in the Serra da Chela mountain range.

===High plateau===
The high plateau lies to the east of the hills and mountains and dominates Angola's terrain. The surface of the plateau is typically flat or rolling, but parts of the Benguela Plateau and the Humpata Highland area of the Hu√≠la Plateau in the south reach heights of 2,500 meters and more. The Malanje Plateau to the north rarely exceeds 1,000 meters in height. The Benguela Plateau and the coastal area in the immediate environs of Benguela and Lobito, the Bi√© Plateau, the Malanje Plateau, and a small section of the Hu√≠la Plateau near the town of Lubango have long been among the most densely settled areas in Angola.

==Drainage==

Most of the country's many rivers originate in central Angola, but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied. A number of rivers flow in a more or less westerly course to the Atlantic Ocean, providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power, only some of which had been realized by 1988. Two of Angola's most important rivers, the Cuanza and the Cunene, take a more indirect route to the Atlantic, the Cuanza flowing north and the Cunene flowing south before turning west. The Cuanza is the only river wholly within Angola that is navigable--for nearly 200 kilometers from its mouth- -by boats of commercially or militarily significant size. The Congo River, whose mouth and western end form a small portion of Angola's northern border with Zaire, is also navigable.

North of the Lunda Divide a number of important tributaries of the Congo River flow north to join it, draining Angola's northeast quadrant. South of the divide some rivers flow into the Zambezi River and thence to the Indian Ocean, others to the Okavango River (as the Cubango River is called along the border with Namibia and in Botswana) and thence to the Okavango Swamp in Botswana. The tributaries of the Cubango River and several of the southern rivers flowing to the Atlantic are seasonal, completely dry much of the year.

==Land use and hazards==

'''Natural resources:''' [[petroleum]], [[diamond]]s, [[iron]] ore, [[phosphates]], [[copper]], [[feldspar]], [[gold]], [[bauxite]], [[uranium]]

'''Land use:'''
* ''arable land:'' 2.41%
* ''permanent crops:'' 0.4%
* ''other:'' 97.19% (1999 est.)

'''Irrigated land:''' 750 km¬≤ (1998 est.)

'''Natural hazards:''' locally heavy rainfall causes periodic flooding on the plateau

== Environment - current issues ==
Overuse of [[pasture]]s and subsequent [[soil erosion]] attributable to population pressures; [[desertification]]; [[deforestation]] of tropical rain forest, in response to both international demand for tropical [[timber]] and to domestic use as fuel, resulting in loss of [[biodiversity]]; soil erosion contributing to [[water pollution]] and [[silting]] of rivers and dams; inadequate supplies of potable water

'''Environment - international agreements:'''
* ''party to:'' Biodiversity, [[Climate Change]], Desertification, [[Law of the Sea]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])
* ''signed, but not ratified:'' none of the selected agreements

== Flora and fauna ==

Both [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] are those characteristic of the greater part of tropical Africa.  As far south as Benguela the coast region is rich in [[oil palm]]s and [[mangrove]]s.  In the Northern part of the province are dense forests.  In the South towards the Kunene are regions of dense [[thorn scrub]].  [[Rubber]] vines and trees are abundant, but in some districts their number has been considerably reduced by the primitive methods adopted by native collectors of rubber.  The species most common are various root rubbers, notably the ''Carpodinus chylorrhiza''.  This species and other varieties of carpodinus are very widely distributed. [[Landolphia]]s are also found.  The [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[Guinea pepper]] plants are indigenous, and the [[tobacco]] plant flourishes in several districts.  Among the trees are several which yield excellent timber, such as the [[tacula]] (''Pterocarpus tinctorius''), which grows to an immense size, its wood being blood-red in colour, and the Angola [[mahogany]].  The [[bark]] of the [[musuemba]] (''Albizzia coriaria'') is largely used in the tanning of [[leather]].  The [[mulundo]] bears a fruit about the size of a cricket ball covered with a hard green shell and containing scarlet pips like a [[pomegranate]].  The fauna includes the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[cheetah]], [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], [[rhinoceros]], [[hippopotamus]], [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], [[zebra]], [[kudu]] and many other kinds of [[antelope]], [[wildpig]], [[ostrich]] and [[crocodile]].  Among fish are the [[barbel]], [[bream]] and [[African yellow fish]].

'''Geography - note:''' the province of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] is an [[exclave]], separated from the rest of the country by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]

== Extreme points ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Angola demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of [[Angola]], Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
The '''demographics of Angola''' consist of three main ethnic groups, each speaking a [[Bantu language]]: [[Ovimbundu]] 37%, [[Kimbundu]] 25%, and [[Bakongo]] 13%. Other groups include [[Chokwe]] (or Lunda), Ganguela, Nhaneca-Humbe, Ambo, Herero, and Xindunga. In addition, mixed racial (European and Africa) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. Portuguese make up the largest non-Angolan population, with at least 30,000 (though many native-born Angolans can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law). In [[1975]], 250,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers settled Angola to help the MPLA forces to fight for its independence. These Cubans are of European and [[Asia]]n (mostly [[Chinese Cuban| Chinese]] descent, while others include those of pure [[Afro-Cuban|African]] and [[mulatto]] descent, who has ancestors in Angola. But in [[1989]], almost all Cubans went out of the country after a peace agreement has been signed between Angola, Cuba, and [[South Africa]]. Cubans speak [[Spanish language]], but almost none of their descendants speak it. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is both the official and predominant language. 

The great majority of the inhabitants are of Bantu-Negro stock with some admixture in the Congo district with the pure negro type. In the south-east are various tribes of Bushmen. The best-known of the Bantu-Negro tribes are the Ba-Kongo (Ba-Fiot), who dwell chiefly in the north, and the Abunda (Mbunda, Ba-Bundo), who occupy the central part of the province, which takes its name from the Ngola tribe of Abunda. Another of these tribes, the Bangala, living on the west bank of the upper Kwango, must not be confounded with the Bangala of the middle [[Congo]]. In the Abunda is a considerable strain of Portuguese blood. The Ba-Lunda inhabit the Lunda district. Along the upper Kunene and in other districts of the plateau are settlements of Boers, the Boer population being about 2000. In the coast towns the majority of the white inhabitants are Portuguese. The Mushi-Kongo and other divisions of the Ba-Kongo retain curious traces of the Christianity professed by them in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and possibly later. Crucifixes are used as potent fetish charms or as symbols of power passing down from chief to chief; whilst every native has a &quot;Santu&quot; or Christian name and is dubbed dom or dona. Fetishism is the prevailing religion throughout the province. The dwelling-places of the natives are usually small huts of the simplest construction, used chiefly as sleeping apartments; the day is spent in an open space in front of the hut protected from the sun by a roof of palm or other leaves.

[[Angola]] changed from a [[Single-party state|one-party]] [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] system ruled by the [[MPLA]] to a formal multiparty democracy following the 1992 elections. President [[Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos|dos Santos]] won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s 40%. A runoff never has taken place. The subsequent renewal of civil war and collapse of the [[Lusaka Protocol]] have left much of this process stillborn, but democratic forms exist, notably the [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]].
Currently, political power is concentrated in the Presidency. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Prime Minister (currently [[Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos]]) and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all government ministers and vice ministers, meets regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented. Courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has never been constituted despite statutory authorization.

The 26-year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically Luanda (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Economy of Angola table}}
[[Angola]]'s is the fastest-growing economy in Africa, largely due to a major oil boom, but it also ranks in the bottom 10 of socioeconomic conditions in the world. Aside from the oil sector and [[diamond]]s, it is in economic disarray because of 26 years of nearly continuous warfare. Despite abundant natural resources, output per capita remains among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture and dependence on humanitarian food assistance sustain the large majority of the population. Little industry exists.

By contrast, the rapidly expanding [[petroleum]] industry now producing up to 800,000 barrels (127,000 m&amp;sup3;) per day, behind only Nigeria in Africa, accounts for more than 60% of GNP and 90% of government revenues. Oil production remains largely offshore and has few linkages with other sectors of the economy. Block Zero, located of the enclave of Cabinda, provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production. There, [[ChevronTexaco]], through its subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, is the operator with a 39.2% share, with [[SONANGOL]] (the Angolan state oil company), [[Total S.A.|Total]], and [[ENI-Agip]] splitting up the rest. ChevronTexaco also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, which started pumping in January 2000. The U.S. takes more than half of Angola's production, by far the largest importer. Exports to Asian countries have grown rapidly in recent years, however, especially China. Significant discoveries have been made on deepwater Blocks 15, 17, 18, and 24, with [[ExxonMobil]], [[BP]], [[Statoil]], [[Norsk Hydro]], and [[Agip]] having major interests. Total operates Angola's one refinery (in Luanda) as a joint venture with SONANGOL; plans for a second refinery in Lobito are moving forward.

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now is forced to import almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. Coffee production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at 800,000 barrels (127,000 m&amp;sup3;) a day. Diamonds make up most of the remaining exports--and have provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and countless fruits.

An economic reform effort was launched in 1998. In April 2000, Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context, the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with World Bank assistance, has begun with the BCI bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports. The U.S. imports about 4% of its oil from Angola, a share which should continue to increase. By the same token, U.S. companies account for more than half the investment in Angola, with Chevron-Texaco leading the way. The U.S. exports industrial goods and services--primarily oilfield equipment, mining equipment, chemicals, aircraft, and food--to Angola, while principally importing petroleum. 

'''Economy - overview:''' Angola is an economy in disarray because of a quarter century of nearly continuous warfare and corruption. Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, violence continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich resources - [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will need to implement the peace agreement and reform government policies. Despite the increase in the pace of civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note. Expanded oil production brightens prospects for 2000, but internal strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector.

[[Angola]]'s military is called the FAA, the Portuguese acronym for [[Angolan Armed Forces]], headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisions--the '''Army''', Navy ('''Marinha de Guerra''', MdG), and '''Air and Air Defense Forces''' (FANA). Total manpower is about 110,000. The army is by far the largest of the services with about 100,000 men and women. The navy numbers about 3,000 and operates several small patrol craft and barges. Air force personnel total about 7,000; its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters and transport planes. A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

Froom 1975 to 1989, [[Angola]] was aligned with the [[Eastern bloc]], in particular the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with [[Western world|Western countries]], cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in [[Central Africa]] through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]]. It has entered the [[Southern African Development Community]] as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely anglophone neighbors to the south. [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]] joined Angola in its military intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where Angolan troops remain in support of the [[Joseph Kabila]] government. It also has intervened in the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the [[UN Security Council]] to impose and carry out sanctions on [[UNITA]]. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on conflict diamonds, the primary source of revenue for UNITA. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with Portugal and Brazil in particular.

'''Disputes - international:''' [[Angola]] gives shelter to thousands of refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo while thousands of Angolan refugees still remain in neighboring states as a consequence of the protracted civil wars in both states

'''Illicit drugs:''' [[Angola]] is used as a transshipment point for cocaine destined for [[Western Europe]] and other African states

'''Albert Sidney Johnston''' ([[February 2]], [[1803]] &amp;ndash; [[April 6]], [[1862]]) was a career [[U.S. Army]] officer and a [[Confederate States Army | Confederate]] [[general]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Considered by [[President of the Confederate States | Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest general in the Confederacy, he was killed early in the war at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].

==Early life==
Johnston was born in [[Washington, Kentucky | Washington]], [[Kentucky]], the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail Harris Johnston. His father was a native of [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in [[Texas]], which he considered his home. He was educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky | Lexington]] and later secured an appointment to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. In [[1826]] he graduated eighth in his class from the [[United States Military Academy]] with a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 2nd U.S. [[Infantry]]. He was assigned to posts in [[New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the [[Black Hawk War]] in [[1832]] as chief of staff to General Henry Atlinson. In [[1829]] he married Henrietta Preston. He resigned his commission in [[1834]] to return to Kentucky to care for his dying wife. They had one son, William Preston Johnston.

==Texas Army==
In April 1834, Johnston took up farming in [[Texas]], but enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texas Army during the [[Texas War of Independence]] against the Republic of [[Mexico]] in [[1836]]. One month later, Johnston was promoted to [[major]] and the position of [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Sam Houston]]. He was named [[Adjutant General]] as a [[colonel]] in the [[Republic of Texas]] Army on [[August 5]], [[1836]]. On [[January 31]], [[1837]], he became Senior Brigadier General in command of the Texas Army.

On [[February 7]], [[1837]], he fought in a [[duel]] with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], challenging each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis. The second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], appointed him Secretary of War on [[December 22]], [[1838]]. Johnston was to provide the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky, where he married [[Eliza Griffin]] in [[1843]]. They settled on a large [[plantation]] he named China Grove in [[Brazoria County, Texas]].

==U.S. Army==
Johnston returned to the Texas Army during the [[Mexican-American War]] under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers.  The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]].  Johnston managed to convince a few volunteers to stay and fight as he himself served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]]. Johnston remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by [[President of the United States | President]] [[Zachary Taylor]] to the U.S. Army as a [[major]] and was made a [[U.S. Army Paymaster | paymaster]] in December of [[1849]]. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than 4,000 miles annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier and elsewhere in the West. In [[1855]] President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the 2nd (now 5th) Cavalry, a new regiment, which he organized. As a key figure in the [[Utah War]], he led U.S. troops who established a non-Mormon government in the formerly [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|Mormon]] territory. He received a [[brevet (military) | brevet]] promotion to [[brigadier general]] in [[1857]] for his service in Utah. He spent [[1860]] in Kentucky until [[December 21]], when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War | Civil War]], Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. He was approached by some Californians who urged him to take his forces east to join the [[Union army | Union]] against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He resigned his commission, [[April 9]], [[1861]], as soon as he heard of the [[secession]] of Texas. He remained in California until June. After a rapid march through the deserts of Arizona and Texas, he reached [[Richmond, Virginia]], on or about [[September 1]], [[1861]]. There Johnston was appointed a general by his friend, Jefferson Davis. On [[May 30]], [[1861]], Johnston became the second highest ranking Confederate General (after the little-known [[Samuel Cooper (general) | Samuel Cooper]]) as commander of the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War | Western Department]]. He raised the [[Army of Mississippi]] to defend Confederate lines from the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kentucky]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

Although the [[Confederate Army]] won a morale-boosting victory at [[First Bull Run]] in the East in [[1861]], matters in the West turned ugly by early [[1862]]. Johnston's subordinate generals lost [[Battle of Fort Henry | Fort Henry]] on [[February 6]], [[1862]], and [[Battle of Fort Donelson | Fort Donelson]] on [[February 16]], [[1862]], to [[Union army | Union]] [[Brigadier General | Brig. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Johnston has been faulted for poor judgment in selecting Gens. [[Lloyd Tilghman | Tilghman]] and [[John B. Floyd | Floyd]] for those crucial positions and for not supervising adequate construction of the forts. And Union Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] captured the vital city of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] was sent west to join Johnston and they organized their forces at [[Corinth, Mississippi]], planning to ambush Grant's forces at [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].

==Shiloh==
Johnston concentrated many of his forces from around the theater and launched a massive surprise attack against Grant at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on [[April 6]], [[1862]]. As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line. At about 2:30 p.m., while leading one of those charges, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He did not think the wound serious at the time, and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded Union soldiers instead. The bullet had in fact clipped his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood. Within a few minutes Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off of his horse, and asked him if he was wounded, to which he replied &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; It is possible that Johnston's duel in [[1837]] had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. Johnston was taken to a small ravine, where he bled to death in minutes.

Ironically, it is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers. He was the highest-ranking casualty of the war and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country; this was two months before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]] as their pre-eminent general.

==Epitaph==
Johnston was buried in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. In [[1866]], a joint resolution of the [[Texas Legislature]] was passed to have his body reinterred to the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] (the re-interment occurred in [[1867]]). Four decades later, the state appointed [[Elisbet Ney]] to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at his gravesite.

The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once his [[plantation]]. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the [[Daughters of The Republic of Texas]] and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederate States of America]].

The '''[[Arctic]] Ocean''', located mostly in the [[North Pole|north polar]] region, is the smallest of the world's five [[ocean]]s, and the shallowest.  Even though [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]] recognizes it as an ocean, [[oceanography|oceanographers]] may call it ''the Arctic Mediterranean Sea'' or simply ''the Arctic Sea'', classifying it as one of the [[mediterranean sea]]s of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Arctic_Ocean.png|right|Arctic Ocean]]

The Arctic Ocean occupies a roughly circular basin and covers an area of about 14,090,000 km¬≤ (5,440,000 mi&amp;sup2;), slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the [[United States|US]].  The coastline length is 45,389 km.  Nearly landlocked, it is surrounded by the land masses of [[Eurasia]], [[North America]], [[Greenland]], and a number of islands.  It includes [[Baffin Bay]], [[Barents Sea]], [[Beaufort Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Hudson Bay]], [[Hudson Strait]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[White Sea]] and other tributary bodies of water.  It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the [[Bering Strait]] and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea.

An underwater [[ocean ridge]], the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], divides the Arctic Ocean into two basins: the [[Eurasian Basin|Eurasian]], or [[Nansen Basin|Nansen]], Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500 m (13,000 and 15,000 ft) deep, and the [[North American Basin|North American]], or [[Hyperborean Basin|Hyperborean]], Basin, which is about 4,000 m deep. The [[topography]] of the ocean bottom is marked by [[fault-block ridge]]s, [[abyssal plain|plains of the abyssal zone]], ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038 m (3,407 ft), in part due to the large extent of [[continental shelf]] extant on the Eurasian side [http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm].

[[Image:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|The Arctic Ocean is used by both [[marine mammal]]s and nuclear [[submarine]]s.]]
The greatest inflow of water comes from the Atlantic by way of the [[Norwegian Current]], which then flows along the Eurasian coast. Water also enters from the Pacific via the Bering Strait. The [[East Greenland Current]] carries the major outflow. [[Temperature]] and [[salinity]] vary [[season]]ally as the ice cover melts and freezes. Ice covers most of the ocean surface year-round, causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time. The Arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the [[equator]], meeting with warmer air in the middle [[latitude]]s and causing [[rain]] and [[snow]]. Little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year. Marine life abounds in open areas, especially the more southerly waters. The ocean's major ports are the [[Russia]]n cities of [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] (Archangel). The Arctic Ocean is important as the shortest air route between the Pacific coast of North America and Europe overflies it.

Major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow cover lasts about 10 months.

==Climate==
[[image:north pole september ice-pack 1978-2002.png|thumb|Extent of the Arctic ice-pack in September, 1978-2002]]
[[image:north pole february ice-pack 1978-2002.png|thumb|Extent of the Arctic ice-pack in February, 1978-2002]]
[[Polar climate]] characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow.

There is considerable seasonal variation in how much [[pack ice]] covers the Arctic Ocean.



==Elevation extremes==
* ''lowest point:'' [[Fram Basin]] &amp;minus;4,665 m (according to [http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm], the Arctic Ocean's Eurasian Basin deepest point is at &amp;minus;5,450 m (17,881 ft))
* ''highest point:'' sea level 0 m

==Natural resources==
Oil and gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, [[fish]], marine mammals ([[Seal (mammal)|seals]] and [[Whale|whales]]).

The political dead zone near the center of the sea is also at the center of a mounting dispute between the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], and [[Denmark]]. It is considered significant because of its potential to contain as much as or more than a quarter of the world's oil and gas resources, the tapping of which could greatly alter the flow of the global energy market. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4354036.stm#map The Arctic's New Gold Rush - BBC]

==Natural hazards==
Ice islands occasionally break away from northern [[Ellesmere Island]]; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern [[Canada]]; permafrost on islands; virtually ice locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing from October to May.

==Environment - current issues==
Endangered marine species include [[Walrus|walruses]] and whales; fragile [[ecosystem]] slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack; seasonal hole in [[ozone layer]] over the [[North Pole]].

Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice will have an effect on the planet's [[albedo]], thus possibly affecting [[global warming]].  Many scientists are presently concerned that warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh, Arctic Ocean meltwater to enter the North Atlantic, possibly disrupting global [[thermohaline circulation|ocean current patterns]]. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.

==Ports and harbors==

==Transportation - note==
Sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the [[Northwest Passage]] (North America) and [[Northern Sea Route]] ([[Eurasia]]) are important seasonal waterways.

==Exploration==
The first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean was led by Wally Herbert in [[1969]], in a dogsled expedition from [[Alaska]] to [[Svalbard]] with air support. See also [[Northwest Passage]], [[Open Polar Sea]].

[[Image:Data2.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], portrayed by [[Brent Spiner]], from the TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'']]An '''android''' is an [[artificial]]ly created [[robot]], an [[automaton]], that resembles a [[human]] being usually both in appearance and behavior.  The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''andr-'', &quot; meaning &quot;[[man]], male&quot;, and the suffix ''-eides'', used to mean &quot;of the [[species]]; alike&quot; (from ''eidos'' &quot;species&quot;).  The word ''[[droid]]'', a robot in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, is derived from this meaning.

In the semantic sense the word &quot;android&quot; is a misnomer. The intended meaning is &quot;an artificial human being like being&quot;, while the literal translation is &quot;an artificial male being&quot;.  The word ''andros'' has definite meaning of &quot;male human being&quot; in Greek, while the word ''man'' can mean either &quot;male human being&quot; or &quot;human being in general&quot;.  The gender-neutral word for human being in Greek is ''anthropos'', and the correct word for an artificial human being-like automaton would be [[anthropoid]].

__TOC__
== Usage and distinctions ==
Unlike the terms ''[[robot]]'' (a &quot;[[mechanics|mechanical]]&quot; being) and ''[[cyborg]]'' (a being that is partly [[organic compound|organic]] and partly mechanical), the word ''android'' has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of [[artificial life|artificially constructed beings]]:

* a robot that closely resembles a human
* a cyborg that closely resembles a human
* an artificially created, yet primarily organic, being that closely resembles a human

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[automata]]'' (devices that have independence).

The term android was first used by the French author [[Mathias Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] (1838-1889) in his work ''[[Tomorrow's Eve]]'', featuring an artificial human-like robot named Hadaly.  As said by the officer in the story, &quot;In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.&quot;

Although [[Karel Capek|Karel &amp;#268;apek]]'s robots in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)&amp;mdash;the play that introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; to the world&amp;mdash;were organic artificial humans, the word ''robot'' has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.  The term android can mean either one of these, while a [[cyborg]] (&quot;cybernetic organism&quot; or &quot;bionic man&quot;) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

== Ambiguity ==
Historically, [[science fiction]] [[authors]] have used &quot;android&quot; in a greater diversity of ways than the terms &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;cyborg&quot;.  In some fiction works, the primary difference between a robot and android is only skin-deep, with androids being made to look almost exactly like humans on the outside, but with internal mechanics exactly the same as that of robots.  In other stories, authors have defined android to indicate a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.  Other definitions of android fall somewhere in between.

The character [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], from the [[television series]] ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', is described as an android.  Data became [[intoxication|intoxicated]] in an early episode (&quot;[[The Naked Now (TNG episode)|The Naked Now]]&quot;) and is later referred to having &quot;bioplast sheeting&quot; for skin (&quot;[[The Most Toys (TNG episode)|The Most Toys]]&quot;), perhaps suggesting that he was initially intended by the writers to be at least partially organic.  Otherwise, Data was shown to be mechanical throughout and this often became a central plot theme.

The [[Replicant]]s from the movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' were [[bioengineering|bioengineered]] organic beings.  While they were not referred to as either robots or androids in the movie, the screenplay was originally based on a [[novel]] by [[Philip K. Dick]] called ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''

In the video game [[Beneath a Steel Sky]], genetically engineered androids similar to Blade Runner's Replicants are a central plot theme.  However, despite their organic makeup, their behavior is programmed by computer.

The robots of &amp;#268;apek's ''R.U.R.'' were organic in nature.  Today, an author writing a similar story might very well be inclined to call them androids.

The character Ash in the movie ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]'', another artificial organic being, is often referred to as an android (though not in the dialogue of the movie itself).  Similarly, the character Bishop in ''[[Aliens (movie)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien¬≥]]'' is a more advanced android commonly called a Synthetic, but prefers to be called an &quot;artificial person&quot;.  Much later in the series timeline, the character Call in ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' is ashamed of being an android. 

[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] from the [[Star Wars]] movies are referred to as ''droids''.  While C-3PO could reasonably be called an android because he is humanoid in appearance, the squat cylinder R2-D2 is only humanoid in behavior.

In the movie ''[[A.I. (movie)|A.I.]]'', the robotic characters are called ''mechanoids'', but the film is loosely based on a short story written by [[Brian Aldiss]] called &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot;, in which the central character David is called an android (by which Aldiss seemed to be referring to an organic creation).

In the anime/manga Chobits, Androids are known as &quot;Persicoms&quot;, essentially computers in a man-made body.  The series does not go into their internal composition, but it is assumed to be artificial with a very realistic outside.  One of the key points of this series was a special type of persicom named a &quot;Chobit&quot;, a persicom that had free will and the ability to fall in love and have emotions.

== Androids in fiction ==
Thus far, androids have remained mostly within the domain of [[science fiction]] and, frequently, in [[film]] and [[television]].  However, some &quot;[[humanoid robot]]s&quot; exist.

One of the earliest android characters is Otho from the [[Captain Future]] stories of [[Edmond Hamilton]].  Otho's construction is never discussed but he is much more human-like than his companion Grag, a mechanical [[robot]].

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s robot stories are mostly about androids; many are collected in ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950).  They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for androids and robots (see [[Three Laws of Robotics]]) that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject.  Most of Asimov's robots appear too artificial to be mistaken for human beings, with the notable exceptions of R. Jander Panell, [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] and Andrew Martin.

Perhaps the most famous android is [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], played by actor [[Brent Spiner]], of the series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (1987&amp;ndash;1994) and several spin-off motion pictures; this character was largely inspired by another android character created by [[Gene Roddenberry]] for ''[[The Questor Tapes]]''.  Data's immediate 'family' ‚Äì brothers [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]] and [[B-4 (Star Trek)|B-4]] et al., daughter [[Lal]], and 'mother' [[Juliana Tainer|Dr. Juliana Tainer]] ‚Äì were also androids (and the fembots are properly, though rarely, referred to as [[gynoid]]s) from the same creator, [[Noonien Soong|Dr. Noonien Soong]].

Earlier in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979), the Ilia [[probe]] ‚Äì a precisely duplicated biomechanical [[drone]] of [[Ilia|Lieutenant Ilia]], with some of her [[emotion]]s intact ‚Äì was dispatched by [[V'ger]] to gather information about the crew of the [[starship]] ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]''.

In the TV series ''[[Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda]]'' (2000&amp;ndash;2005), the [[gynoid]] [[Rommie]] is an extension of [[Andromeda Ascendant|the starship]]'s [[artificial intelligence|AI]] [[operating system]], represented by an [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]] of Rommie.

In the re-imagined series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (2003&amp;ndash;), the gynoid [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] is one of a (seductive) variant of the [[antagonist]]ic, robotic [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]] that is used to infiltrate the fleeing [[human]] [[Twelve Colonies|Colonial forces]] and, particularly, the mind of the scientist [[Gaius Baltar|Dr. Gaius Baltar]].

Androids (Jinzou Ningen in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; meaning 'artificial human') are also a race in ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', and ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]''.  The androids' names were only numbers (such as Android #13 or Android #20). They were created by Dr. Gero, Dr. Muu, and the Red Ribbon Army.  Some are entirely artificial and some are created from humans and can be considered cyborgs.

Jinzo Ningen [[Kikaider]] was the first [[manga]] and [[tokusatsu]] series to feature an android protagonist.

The series [[Xenosaga]] borrows Villiers' original term Realian when referring to a race of beings created by Vector Corporation.  Two playable characters are androids (MOMO and KOS-MOS). One is refered to as a Realian while the second is simply an android.

In their respective series by [[Capcom]], [[Mega Man]] was initially called a &quot;humanoid&quot;, which was then simplified to robot.  [[Mega Man X|X]], a later version, is said to be more advanced, more independent of thought, and closer to an android.  Other beings, based off his design, are called [[Reploids]].

Many more examples may be found in this [[list of fictional robots]].

'''Alberta''' is one of [[Canada|Canada's]] [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]].   It celebrated 100 years as a province on [[September 1]], [[2005]].

Alberta is located in western Canada.  It is bounded on the west by the province of British Columbia, on the north by the Northwest Territories, on the east by the province of Saskatchewan, and on the south by the United States of America (State of Montana).

Alberta's capital is the city of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], located just south of the centre of the province.  The most populous city and metropolitan area is [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]]. Calgary is also the province's busiest transportation hub (for road, air, and rail) and is one of Canada's major commerce centres. Other major municipalities include [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Lethbridge, Alberta|Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]], [[Fort McMurray, Alberta|Fort McMurray]], [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], [[Lloydminster, Alberta|Lloydminster]], [[Wetaskiwin, Alberta|Wetaskiwin]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], and [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]]. See also: [[List of communities in Alberta]].

The [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] of the province is Hon. [[Ralph Klein]], Progressive Conservative.  See also [[List of Alberta Premiers]].

Alberta is named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848-1939), the fourth daughter of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]].  Princess Louise was also the wife of [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Sir John Campbell]], who was the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1878-1883.  [[Lake Louise]] was also named in honour of Princess Louise.

==Geography==
:''Main article: [[Geography of Alberta]]''

Alberta is in [[western Canada]], and covers an area of 661,190 km¬≤ (255,287 mi¬≤). To the south, it borders the US state of [[Montana]] at a latitude of 49¬∞N, or the [[49th parallel north|49th Parallel]]. To the east at a longitude of 110¬∞W, it borders the province of [[Saskatchewan]]. At 60¬∞N, it is bordered by the [[Northwest Territories]]. To the west, its border with [[British Columbia]] follows the line of peaks of the [[Rocky Mountains]] range along the [[Continental Divide]], which runs northwesterly until it reaches 120¬∞ W, at which point the border follows this meridian to 60¬∞N.

With the exception of the southeastern section, the province is well watered. Alberta contains dozens of rivers and lakes ideal for [[swimming]], [[water skiing]], [[fishing]] and a full range of other [[water sports]]. There are a multitude of fresh-water lakes, each less than 260&amp;nbsp;km¬≤ situated in Alberta, and three of more considerable size.  These three larger lakes are [[Lake Athabasca]] (7898&amp;nbsp;km¬≤), part of which lies in the province of Saskatchewan, [[Lake Claire (Albertan lake)|Lake Claire]] (1436&amp;nbsp;km¬≤), which lies just west of Lake Athabasca in [[Wood Bufflao National Park]], and [[Lesser Slave Lake]] (1168&amp;nbsp;km¬≤), which is well northwest of [[Edmonton]].

As Alberta extends for 1200&amp;nbsp;km from north to south, and about 600&amp;nbsp;km wide at its greatest east-west extent, it is natural that the climate should vary considerably between the 49th and 60th  parallels. It is also further influenced by altitude, especially in the southwestern part of the province within the [[Canadian Rockies]] and adjacent areas directly to the east.

[[Image:Canada 35 bg 061904.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Banff National Park]]

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has fewer frost-free days than southern Alberta, which is often semi-arid due to the summer heat and much lower rainfall. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains, and enjoys the warmth brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s, while southeastern Alberta is flat, dry prairie, where temperatures can range from very cold (&amp;minus;35¬∞C (&amp;minus;31¬∞F) in the winter) to very hot (35¬∞C (95¬∞F) or higher in the summer). Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely [[aspen parkland]], a [[biome]] transitional between [[prairie]] to the south and [[taiga|boreal forest]] to the north. After southern [[Ontario]], Central Alberta is the most likely region in [[Canada]] to experience [[tornadoe]]s. [[Thunderstorm]]s, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada. 

Overall, Alberta has cold winters, with a daytime average of about &amp;minus;10¬∞C (14¬∞F) in the south to &amp;minus;24¬∞C (&amp;minus;12¬∞F) in the north. In the summer, the daytime temperature averages from about 13¬∞C (55¬∞F) in the Rocky Mountains to 19¬∞C (67¬∞F) in the dry prairie to the south-east. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures.

Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is located almost in the geographic centre of the province, and most of Alberta's oil is [[refinery|refined]] here. Southern Alberta, where [[Calgary]] is located, is known for its [[ranching]]. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to [[dairy farming]], with ranching predominantly a southern Alberta industry.  

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Dinosaurparkalberta.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Badlands]] terrain at the Dinosaur Provincial Park]] --&gt;
In southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] traverses the flat prairie and farmland, are the Alberta [[badlands]] with deep [[gorge|gorges]] and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Drumheller, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, [[desert]] [[flora (plants)|flora]], and remnants from Alberta's past when [[dinosaurs]] roamed the then lush landscape.

Alberta is one of only two Canadian provinces to have no maritime coast (the other being the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.)

Only 15,487 people live on the Alberta side, which would make it Alberta's 11th largest city.''&lt;/small&gt;

==Industry==
:''Main article: [[Industry in Alberta]]''

Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country.  Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in [[North America]] are located in central and north central Alberta.  In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (previously known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands|Tar Sands]]) have estimated [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves in excess of that of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km¬≥).  With the advancement of extraction methods, bitumen and economical synthetic crude are produced at costs nearing that of conventional crude.  This technology is Alberta grown and developed.  Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the Athabasca deposit.  With current technology, only 315 billion barrels (50 km¬≥) are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's youngest and liveliest cities, has grown up entirely because of the large [[multinational corporation]]s which have taken on the task of oil production.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil.  In 2005, record oil prices have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

While [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] is considered the pipeline junction, manufacturing, chemical processing, research and refining centre of the province, [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] is known for its senior and junior oil company head offices (unlike Edmonton, Calgary is not close to any large sources of oil).

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably the invention and perfection of [[liquid crystal display]] systems.  With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with several civil and private funds.

==Agriculture and forestry==
  
[[Image:Alberta red farm buildings.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Farm Buildings]]
[[Image:Field 150.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alberta canola field]]
[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Grain Elevator - Alberta]]
[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy.  Over 5 million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another, and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta.  Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[mutton]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grain]]s also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation.  Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion.  Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]] and [[plywood]], and several northern Alberta plants supply [[North America]] and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

==Government==
:''See also:  [[Politics of Alberta]]''

[[Edmonton]] is the seat of government of Alberta. It is a [[parliamentary]] [[democracy]]. Its [[unicameral]] legislature  -- the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]] -- consists of 83 members. As Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II is the Government of Alberta's chief executive.  Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor, Norman Kwong.  The government is headed by the [[Premier]], [[Ralph Klein]].  The city of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] is Alberta's government capital.

The province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil, natural gas, beef, softwood lumber, and wheat, but also includes [[grant]]s from the [[federal government]] primarily for [[infrastructure]] projects.  Albertans are the lowest-[[tax]]ed people in [[Canada]], and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[GST]]). Alberta's municipalities have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta's [[politics]] are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces.  Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the [[Alberta Progressive Conservatives|Progressive Conservatives]] (&quot;Conservatives&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;), the centrist [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. A fourth party, the strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], was a power in Alberta for many [[decade]]s, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in the early [[1970s]]. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta.  In fact, only  three parties have governed Alberta: the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] the Social Credit Party, and the currently-governing Progressive Conservative Party  

As is the case with many western Canadian provinces, Alberta has had occasional bouts of separatist sentiment. Even during the [[1980|1980s]], when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referenda. There are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province. See also: [[Alberta separatism]].

In the [[Alberta general election, 2004|2004 provincial election]], held in November, the [[Alberta Alliance Party]], running to the [[right-wing politics|right]] of the Conservatives, won one seat.

==Education==
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta government is the highest authority in education, creating and regulating the school boards, public colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.

===K-12===
The vast majority of Alberta's schools are run by publicly funded school boards (each with its own district of authority).  The largest are English language Public school boards.  Alberta also has English Separate Catholic boards throughout the province, which serve a substantial minority of students.  There is one protestant school board in part of the province.  Where numbers warrant, there are francophone school boards (Public and Separate Catholic).  All five of these types of boards are  primarily publicly funded (basic school fees range from $200-$750 depending on the school board) by local property taxes and provincial grants given on an equal per student basis by the province (with some adjustments).  The different types of school boards are a necessity under the Canadian constitution, which guarantees the francophones and Catholic communities both the right to their own schools, and the right to administer them.  

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Myhallway.jpg|thumb|210px|right|School Hallway]] --&gt;

Some other Canadian provinces have reformed their school systems on non-religious lines, by seeking a constitutional amendment, but Alberta has not.  Often the decision to go to one system or another is not based on religion, but a parent's belief of which system provides a better education.

Starting in 1994, the province has allowed some [[Alberta charter schools|chartered schools]] to operate, independently of any district school board, reporting directly to the province.  Homeschooling is officially recognized and partially funded from within the Alberta school system.

Originally in Alberta, school boards had the power to levy property taxes within their respective districts. However, this meant districts with a low tax base were underfunded, so the province moved to a system that pools the education property tax, and distributes it based on student population and need.

===Post-secondary===
Alberta's oldest and largest university is Edmonton's [[University of Alberta]]. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966, and is now the second largest university in Alberta.  There is also [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]].  There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology|SAIT]] ([http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/college/postsecsystem/postsecinst/postsecinst.asp]).  Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions.

==Transportation==
Alberta has over 180,000&amp;nbsp;km of [[highway]]s and roads, of which nearly 50,000&amp;nbsp;km are paved. The main north-south [[corridor]] is [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]], which begins south of [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] at the [[Carway, Alberta|Carway]] [[border]] crossing. Highway 4, which effectively extends [[Interstate 15|U.S. Interstate Highway 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at [[Lethbridge, Alberta|Lethbridge]]. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway 3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] before dividing into two highways. One continues northwest as Highway 43 into [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]] and the [[Peace River country]]; the other (Highway 63) travels northeast to [[Fort McMurray]], the location of the [[Athabasca Tar Sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]].  Highway 2 is supplimented by two more highways that run parallel to it: highway 22, west of highway 2, known as 'the cowboy trail', and highway 21, east of highway 2.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]], runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through [[Banff National Park]].  The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network but known alternatively as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]]), runs west from [[Lloydminster, Alberta/Saskatchewan|Lloydminster]] in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into [[British Columbia]]. On a sunny spring or fall day, one of the most scenic drives in the world is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs some 300&amp;nbsp;km between Jasper and Banff, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and [[freeway]]s are often called ''trails''.  For example, Highway 2 is Deerfoot Trail as it passes through Calgary, Calgary Trail as it leaves Edmonton southbound, and St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton northbound toward the city of [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]].  Visitors from outside Alberta often find this disconcerting, accustomed as they are to the notion that a trail is an unpaved route primarily for [[pedestrian]]s.

Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial mass transit systems.  Edmonton and Calgary also operate light rail vehicles.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with international [[airport]]s at both Edmonton and Calgary. Calgary's airport is the larger of the two, and is also the fourth busiest in Canada. It is a hub airport for a significant proportion of the connecting trans-border and international flights into and out of central Canada. There are over 9000&amp;nbsp;km of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard [[Via Rail]] or [[Rocky Mountain Railtours]].

==Culture==
:''Main article: [[Culture of Alberta]]''

Alberta is well known for its warm and outgoing friendliness and [[frontier]] spirit.  

[[Image:whyte4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Whyte Avenue, Edmonton]]

Summer brings many festivals to the province.  Edmonton's Fringe Festival is the world's second largest after [[Edinburgh]]'s. Alberta also hosts some of Canada's largest folk festivals, multicultural festivals, and heritage days (to name a few). Calgary is also home to [[Carifest]], the second largest [[Caribbean]] festival in the nation (after [[Caribana]] in [[Toronto]]). These events highlight the province's cultural diversity and love of entertainment.  Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre]]. 

Alberta also has a large ethnic population. Both the Chinese and East Indian communities are significant. According to [[Statistics Canada]], Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province. As reported in the 2001 census, the [[China|Chinese]] represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population and [[India|East Indians]] represented better than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have [[Chinatown]]s and Calgary's is Canada's third largest. [[Aboriginal peoples in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population. 

The major contributors to Alberta's ethnic diversity have been the European nations. Forty-four percent of Albertans are of [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, and there are also large numbers of [[Germany|Germans]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]], and [[Scandinavia]]ns.

Both cities heavily support first-class [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. [[football (soccer)|Soccer]], [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta. 

[[Tourism]] is also important to Albertans. A million visitors come to Alberta each year just for Calgary's world-famous [[Calgary Stampede | Stampede]] and for Edmonton's [[Klondike Days]]. Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

[[Image:Stephen_Avenue.jpg |thumb|left|Stephen Avenue, Calgary]]

Visitors throng to Calgary for ten days every July for a taste of &quot;Stampede Fever&quot;. As a celebration of Canada's own [[Wild West]] and the cattle ranching industry, the [[Calgary Stampede | Stampede]] welcomes around 1.2 million people each year. Only an hour's drive from the [[Rocky Mountains]], Calgary also makes a visit to tourist attractions like [[Banff National Park]] something which can easily be done in a day. Calgary and Banff each host nearly 5 million tourists yearly.

Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to [[skiing|ski]] and [[hiking|hike]]; Alberta boasts several world-class [[ski resort]]s. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive [[trophy|trophies]] and [[tall tales]] from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.

==Demographics==
Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, due in large part to its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province saw high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as [[British Columbia]]), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm]. As of 2005, the population of the province was 3,212,813 (''Albertans''). 81% of this population lives in urban areas and 19% is rural. The [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized area in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history.

Racially and ethnically, the province is predominantly [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]. 88.8% of the population is either white or [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal]] (Aboriginals represent a fairly small proportion of this percentage, however). This number is significantly smaller in many of the cities, particularly [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] which are home to a much larger number of visible minorities.

'''Visible Minorities'''
*3.3% [[China|Chinese]]
*2.3% [[Asian]]
*1.1% [[Black]]
*1.1% [[Filipino people|Filipino]]

Most Albertans identify as [[Christian]]s. Nevertheless, many people in the province observe other faiths or do not profess to a religion at all. Alberta has a somewhat higher percentage of [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians than do other provinces.  Conversely, Alberta also has the second highest percentage of [[Non-religious]] residents in Canada (after British Columbia).

The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province. There are [[Temple (Mormonism)|temples]] in both Cardston and Edmonton. Many Alberta Mormons descend from [[Mormon pioneers]] who emigrated from [[Utah]] around the turn of the 20th century. Alberta also has a large [[Hutterite]] population, a communal  [[Anabaptist]] sect similar to the [[Mennonites]], and a significant population of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] in and around the [[Lacombe]] area due to the presence of the [[Canadian University College]].

Many people of the [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]], and [[Muslim]] faiths also make Alberta their home; one of the largest [[Gurdwara|Sikh temples]] in Canada is located just outside of Edmonton.

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of Alberta]]''

The present province of Alberta, as far north as about 53¬∞ north latitude, was a part of [[Rupert's Land]] from the time of the incorporation of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] ([[1670]]).  After the arrival in the North-West of the French around 1731 they settled the prairies of the west, establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville. Fort La Jonqui√®re was established near what is now Calgary in (1752).  The [[North-West Company]] of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived from Hudson Bay to take possession of it.  The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who, on behalf of the North-West Company of Montreal, built [[Fort Athabasca]] on [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] in 1778.  [[Roderick Mackenzie]] built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on [[Lake Athabasca]] ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the [[Athabasca River]], which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name -- the [[Mackenzie River]] -- which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to [[Lake Athabasca]], he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]], and so being the first white man to cross the North American continent north of [[Mexico]].

The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status.

==Fauna and flora==
===Fauna===
The three climatic regions ([[alpine]], [[forest]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals.  The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of [[American Bison|buffalo]]. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback, and thrive on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[Grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[american Black Bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions.  Smaller carnivores of the [[dog]] and [[Felidae|cat]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]], [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).  

[[Image:Bighorn23.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rocky Mountains]] Bighorn Sheep]]

[[Herbivorous]], or plant-eating animals, are found throughout the province. [[Moose]] and [[deer]] (both mule and white-tail [[variety (biology)|varieties]]) are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn antelope]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta.  [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains.  [[Rabbit]]s,  [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]]. 

Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting-ground of the migratory birds.  Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found.  Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and [[bee]]s.  Rivers and lakes are well stocked with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[white fish]], [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], and [[Brown trout|brown]] [[trout]], and even [[sturgeon]].  [[Turtle]]s are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province.  [[Frog]]s and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

===Flora===
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie anemone, the [[avens]], [[crocus]]es, and other early flowers.  The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the [[sunflower]] family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple.  The southern part of Alberta is covered by a short grass, very nutritive, but dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the [[buffalo bean]], [[fleabane]], and [[sage]].  Both yellow and purple [[clover]] fill the roadways and the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides.  These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[birch]], [[poplar]], and [[tamarack]]. Many species of [[willow]] and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain.  On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres.  [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or [[cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species.  [[Conifer]]s include [[Jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].

[[Image:ARCTIC CIRCLE 021106.jpg|thumb|350px]]

[[Image:Arctic Circle sign.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sign along the [[Dalton Highway]] marking the location of the Arctic Circle]]

The '''Arctic Circle''' is one of the five major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] that mark maps of the [[Earth]]. This is the parallel of [[latitude]] that (in 2000) runs [[degree (angle)|66¬∞ 33' 39&quot;]] north of the [[Equator]]. Everything north of this circle is known as the [[Arctic]], and the zone just to the south of this circle is the [[temperate|Northern Temperate Zone]]. 

The Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the [[polar day]] of the [[summer solstice]] in June and the [[polar night]] of the [[winter solstice]] in December. Within the Arctic Circle, the arctic [[Sun]] is above the [[horizon]] for at least 24 continuous [[hour]]s once per [[year]], in conjunction with the Arctic's [[Summer Solstice]] - this is often referred to in local [[wiktionary:Vernacular|vernacular]] as [[midnight sun]]. Likewise, in conjunction with the Arctic's [[Winter Solstice]], the Arctic sun will be below the horizon for at least 24 continuous hours.
(In fact, because of [[refraction]] and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen at the night of the summer solstice up to about 50' (90 km) south of the geometric arctic circle; similarly, at the day of the winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about 50' north of the geometric arctic circle. This is true at sea level;  these limits increase with elevation above sea level, however in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the horizon.)

The position of the Arctic Circle is determined by the [[axial tilt]] (angle) of the polar axis of rotation of the Earth on the [[ecliptic]].  This angle is not constant, but has a complex motion determined by many cycles of short to very long periods.  Due to [[nutation]] the tilt oscillates over 9&quot; (about 280 [[metre|m]] on the surface) over a period of 18.6 years.  The main long-term cycle has a period of 41000 years and an amplitude of about 0.68¬∞, or 76 km on the surface.  Currently the tilt is decreasing by about 0.47&quot; per year, so the Arctic Circle is moving north by about 14 m per year.  Also see [[precession]].

Countries which have significant territory within the Arctic Circle are:

* [[Russia]]
* [[Canada]]
* [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]])
* [[United States of America]] ([[Alaska]])
* [[Norway]]
* [[Sweden]]
* [[Finland]]

The country of [[Iceland]] also has territory within the Arctic Circle, but less than 1 sq km.  This area is on a few small islets, of which only [[Gr√≠msey]] (which lies directly on the Arctic Circle) is inhabited.

An '''assault rifle''' is a type of [[automatic rifle]] generally defined as a [[selective fire]] [[rifle]] or [[carbine]] (depending on the particular [[firearm]]'s size), using intermediate-powered ammunition. They are categorized between the larger and heavier [[light machine gun]] and the weaker [[submachine gun]]. Assault rifles are the standard [[Small arms|small arm]] in most modern [[Army|armies]], having largely replaced or suplemented the larger, more powerful rifles of the past.

The name is a literal translation of the German term ''Sturmgewehr'' or &quot;storm weapon&quot;, first applied to the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], developed during [[World War II]]. It gradually became a popular term for this type of firearm. The term has since been retro-actively applied to earlier weapons with similar traits.

==History==

===1900s to the 1930s: Light automatic rifles using rifle cartridges===
[[Image:Avtomat Fedorova 1916.jpg|right|thumb|]]Federov Avtomat (Russia). The weapon fired the Japanese rifle [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge.]]

''These automatic firearms tended to use used pre-existing rifle cartridges, [[kinetic energy]] ranged between 3,000&amp;ndash;5,000 [[Joule|J]] (2,200&amp;ndash;3,700 foot-pounds), velocites of 750&amp;ndash;900 [[m/s]] (2,460&amp;ndash;2,950 ft/s) and bullets of 9 to 13 [[Gram|g]] (139&amp;ndash;200 grains).''

The first true assault rifle was probably the [[Italy|Italian]]-made [[Cei-Rigotti]], which was developed in the 1890s and finished around 1900, at the beginning of the 20th century; it never entered military service, however. The first service assault rifle was the [[Russia]]n [[Federov Avtomat]] of 1916, chambered for the [[Japan]]ese [[Arisaka]] 6.5 √ó 50 mm rifle [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], which was only used in small numbers due to supply problems.

The [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) was a [[World War I]]-era weapon that used a full-power round. It was an [[automatic rifle]] by today's definition, and designed for single accurate shots and suppressive automatic fire. The weight of roughly 15 pounds (7 kg) meant that it was rather cumbersome for closer quarters. Later developments added heavier [[Gun barrel|barrels]] and [[bipod]]s that lent it to being used as more like today's light machine gun or [[squad automatic weapon]], though it did help establish the doctrine of use for light selective fire rifles. The BAR was produced in large numbers, widely adopted, and served into the 1960s with the U.S. military and other nations. While it did not use an intermediate cartridge, it was an intermediate weapon between the newly adopted submachine guns and heavier [[machine gun]]s such as the [[Lewis Gun]].

During WWI, a few weaker submachine guns also entered service, such as the [[Villar Perosa]], the [[Berretta 1918]] and the [[MP18]]. These weapons fired rounds based of pistols ‚Äî [[9 mm Glisenti]] and [[9 mm Bergmann]]. The 9 mm Bergman was based on the [[9 mm Parabellum]], with reduced charge to reduce recoil in the MP18. The developers of the [[Thompson submachine gun]] (also developed during the 1910s) originally intended to use rifle-powered rounds. However, a mechanical system that could handle their power was not found and it ended up using the [[.45 ACP]] cartridge. These firearms are considered part of the [[submachine gun]] class, but were an important part in the development of the assault rifles.

===1930s: Automatic intermediate weapons===

''Some of these automatic and [[semi-automatic]] firearms used new intermediate cartridges; others used pre-existing rounds.''

An attempt to provide soldiers with a rifle with intermediate-power ammunition that was heavier than a [[submachine gun]] (too weak, with short range due to the [[pistol]] ammunition), but lighter than a long rifle (uncomfortable to fire, and difficult to control on [[fully-automatic]] mode due to the powerful ammunition; more expensive to design and manufacture), by the [[Italy|Italian]] arms company [[Beretta]] resulted in the MAB 38 (''Moschetto Automatico Beretta 1938''). The MAB 38 used a [[Fiocchi]] ''9M38'' cartridge and a higher-powered 9 mm Parabellum cartridge, which could provide longer range fire. The effective range was about 200 m, although it was declared to be effective up to 500 m. The MAB 38 was a multipurpose weapon.

[[Image:M1 Carbine.jpg|thumb|[[M1 Carbine]] (U.S.). Unlike the M1, the later M2 and M3 were [[Automatic fire|fully-automatic]]]]

In 1938, prior to World War II, the United States introduced the [[M1 Carbine]], which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the [[.30 Carbine]] cartridge. The M1 Carbine was originally planned to have automatic fire, but this was dropped from the first version, although later in the war, selective fire variants were made (M2 and M3 Carbines). The weapon had higher [[stopping power]] than [[submachine gun]]s, but was not as powerful as full-size automatic rifles such as the BAR. The longer barrel (18-inch) provided the carbine with higher [[muzzle velocity]] than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same .30 round.

The M1 Carbine series was designed for close quarters engagements, a concept that would be re-applied later. It marked the first time in which such an intermediate weapon would be mass-produced in such large numbers &amp;mdash; it became the most produced American weapon of the war, with millions made. The M1 Carbine series would remain in service with the U.S. military until replaced by the [[M16 (rifle)|M16 rifle]] in the 1960s; it continued to be used in other nations.

===1940s and 1950s: Maschinenkarabiner, Sturmgewehr, &amp; the AK-47===
[[Image:Sturmgewehr 44.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sturmgewehr 44]] (Germany). Its development began in earnest with the Maschinenkarabiner project]]

''Some of these automatic firearms used pre-existing rounds; others used new intermediate cartridges. Kinetic energy ranged between 1,400&amp;ndash;2,100 J (1,033&amp;ndash;1,550 foot-pounds), muzzle velocities of 600&amp;ndash;800m/s (1,970&amp;ndash;2,625 ft/s) and bullets of 7&amp;ndash;9g (108&amp;ndash;139 grains).''

Germany, like other countries, had studied the problem since [[World War I]], and their factories made a variety of non-standard cartridges, therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers. The 7.92 √ó 30 mm cartridge was an example of these experiments; in 1941, it was improved to [[7.92 x 33 mm|7.92 √ó 33 mm]] ''Infanterie Kurz Patrone'' (&quot;Infantry Short Standard&quot;). In 1942, it was again improved as ''Maschinenkarabiner Patrone S'', and in 1943, ''Pistolen Patrone 43mE''; then, finally, ''Infanterie Kurz Patrone 43''. It is just a coincidence, but the intermediate cartridge developed by Winchester for the M1 Carbine, developed slightly before, also measured 33 mm.

In 1942, [[Walther]] presented the ''Maschinenkarabiner'' (&quot;automatic carbine&quot;, abbr. MKb), named MKb42(W). In the same year, [[Haenel]] presented the MKb42(H), designed by [[Hugo Schmeisser]] as a result of this program. Rheinmetall-Borsig (some said Krieghoff) presented its [[FG 42]] (''Fallschirmjaeger Gewehr 42'', sponsored by [[Hermann G√∂ring]]) though this was in a different role, and using a heavy [[8 mm Mauser|8 √ó 57 mm]] (8 mm Mauser) cartridge, which was not an intermediate round. War-time tests in [[Russia]] indicated the MKb42(H) performed better than the other two. Schmeisser developed it first as the MP43, then MP43/1, and finally as the MP44/Sturmgewehr 44 (abbreviated StG44). It immediately entered large scale production. More than 5,000 units had been produced by February 1944, and 55,000 by the following November.

Following the end of the war, the [[Soviet Union]] developed the [[AK-47]], which was vaguely similar in concept and layout to the German StG44, but extremely different mechanically. It fired the [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 √ó 39 mm]] cartridge, which had been developed during WWII. The round was similar to the StG44's in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the Russian rifle ammunition.

===1960s and 1970s: Lighter automatic weapons and lighter smaller bullets===

''Many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and smaller calibers, but fired at very high velocity, kinetic energy ranged between 1300&amp;ndash;1800J (960&amp;ndash;1,330 foot-pounds),  velocities of 900&amp;ndash;1050m/s (2,950&amp;ndash;3,450 ft/s), and bullets of 3&amp;ndash;4g (46&amp;ndash;62 grains).''

[[Image:Stgw 90.jpg|thumb|right|[[SIG 550]] ([[Switzerland|Swiss]]). The SIG fires [[Gw Pat.90]], which has the same caliber as the [[5.56 mm NATO]]]]

Many nations continued the development of traditional high-powered rifles with ranges of 500 meters (550 yards) and beyond. Most designs of this period used low-caliber but high-velocity ammunition, with some experiments in [[flechette]]s and other exotic ammunition.

Statistical studies of World War II battles performed by the [[U.S. Army]] revealed that infantry combat beyond 300 meters (325 yards) was rare. The Russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman's ability to aim. Therefore, a lighter, less-powerful cartridge could be effective. This permitted a lighter rifle and enabled troops to carry more ammunition, making them more autonomous &amp;mdash; a greater amount of the lighter ammunition could be transported in the same amount of space. In addition, the smaller size and handiness of an assault rifle would benefit [[tank]] crews, support troops, and units with missions other than [[front line]] combat. The [[5.56 x 45 mm NATO|5.56 √ó 45 mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the 1960s, and was adopted for use in the [[M16 (rifle)|M16]] assault rifle. The M16A1 version soon followed, and was then replaced in 1982 by the M16A2.

The [[Soviet Union]] also developed its own similar round, the [[5.45 x 39 mm|5.45 √ó 39 mm]], which was used in the [[AK-74]], the successor of the [[AK-47]]. 

These rounds are usually considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds that fired larger rifle caliber ammunition with reduced propellant, but the smaller caliber and lighter bullets achieve higher velocities than even a hunting rifle bullet. These high speeds induce additional lethality through bullet shattering, although these high speed rounds generally do not exceed the momentum of the heavier (but slower) bullets of the less sophisticated AK-47. Any pointed (spitzer) round will tumble in soft tissue. If the jacket has a cannelure like the U.S. 5.56 √ó 45 mm M193 round, the bullet will fragment, leading to significant blood loss and internal damage. 

Blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation, but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue. Since combat use of rifles expends around 50,000 rounds in suppressive fire for each combatant killed, trading lighter cartridge weight and lower recoil for slower but more sure incapacitation often makes good sense.

The key to the assault rifle concept is firing at both known ''and suspected'' enemy positions. This allows an attacking infantry unit to shoot at a hidden enemy first, rather than waiting for the enemy to fire first. Good volume and distribution of aimed suppressive fire delivered by infantry squad members as they maneuver, prevents enemy return fire, and in turn allows the assaulting unit to maneuver through enemy fields of fire faster. Faster maneuver limits the assaulting unit's vulnerability to small arms fire, [[artillery]], [[mortar]]s, or counter-attack. Of course this requires a larger basic ammunition load and steady supply of rifle ammunition.

===1970s, 1980s, 1990s: New form factors and features===

''Many of these automatic firearms usually used the same rounds as in older eras, but focused on using new form factors, materials, and added features like standard [[Telescopic sight|telescopic]] and [[Red dot sight|reflex]] sights.''

[[Image:FAMAS dsc06877.jpg|thumb|[[FAMAS]] ([[France]]). It was adopted in 1978]]

The biggest change since adoption of high velocity rounds of 5 mm caliber and higher, has been designs that have new form factors, sights, electronics, and materials. A number of [[bullpup]] rifles entered service in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although bullpup rifles had existed since the 1930s, the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[EM2]] was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time. Examples of the new trend include the [[FAMAS]], [[Steyr AUG]], and [[SA80]]. They were all bullpup rifles that made heavy use of composites and plastics with ambidextrous controls, and the latter both added a low-power [[telescopic sight]] to the standard service version. The [[SAR-21]], the [[Tavor TAR-21]], and [[QBZ-95]] follow a similar trend as well, with a bullpup configuration and heavy use of composites.

The [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36]], adopted in the late 1990s by [[Spain]] and [[Germany]], is of the traditional configuration, but also has integral telescopic and red dot sights and composite exterior. The [[XM8 rifle]], developed from the G36, had similar features, but also added more electronics such as [[laser]] sight, round counter, and integral [[infrared]] laser and pointers.

The trend in the new designs, and very likely future ones, is towards more integrated features and lighter weight with new materials and configurations. Introduction of a new ammunition would require retooling factories, phasing out conventional ammunition and in general infrastructure change that is considered by many military planners too expensive to undertake.

Some have called for a reintroduction of larger caliber rounds to improve conventional lethality, or an increase in caliber in the 6&amp;ndash;7 mm range, with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets: a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber&amp;ndash;faster modern rounds and the standard caliber‚Äìslower rounds of the previous generation. China in the late 1980's introduced a 5.8 √ó 42 mm round, with an initial velocity of 930 m/s, 4.26 g bullet and 1,842 J of energy, China claims the new round provides superior performace and lethality to the NATO and modern Soviet intermediate rounds. In the United States, [[Remington]] has developed the [[6.8 mm Remington SPC]] cartridge, which is the same overall length at the 5.56 x 45 mm NATO round but fires a bullet the same caliber at the [[.270 Winchester]] hunting cartridge.  Its similar size to the 5.56 √ó 45 mm means that existing rifles can be converted without an excessive amount of trouble.  Development of a [[G11|4.73 mm]] [[caseless ammunition]] and advanced assault rifle in the 1970&amp;ndash;1980s by Germany was effectively halted by the [[German reunification]] in 1990, and that rifle never entered full production.

==&quot;Assault weapons&quot; vs. Fully-automatic weapons==
Primarily in the [[United States]], the term ''[[assault weapon]]'' is an arbitrary (and politicized) phrase generally used to describe a collection of '''''semi-automatic''''' firearms that have certain features associated with military/police use, such as a folding stock, [[flash suppressor]], [[bayonet]], protruding pistol grip, or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of a capacity larger than ten rounds. The phrase ''assault weapon'' has been used primarily in relation to a specific expired [[gun law]] that was commonly known as the '[[Federal assault weapons ban|Assault Weapons Ban]]', '[[Clinton]] gun ban', or '1994 crime bill'. It is a common misconception that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully-automatic fire, such as assault rifles and [[machine gun]]s. Fully-automatic weapons were unaffected by the ban because they have been heavily restricted since the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934, and other, more recent laws. 

The term 'assault weapon' has often been erroneously used to describe machine guns. Many states and localities still use the term [[assault weapon]] with a variety of variations following the California model loosely. See separate article on [[assault weapon]]s for further information.

'''Animals''' are a major group of [[organism]]s, classified as the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] '''Animalia''' or '''Metazoa'''.  In general they are [[multicellular]], capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment, and feed by consuming other organisms.  Their body plan becomes fixed as they develop, usually early on in their [[ontogeny|development]] as [[embryo]]s, although some undergo a process of [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] later on.  

The name animal comes from the [[Latin]] word ''animal'', of which ''animalia'' is the plural, and ultimately from ''anima'', meaning vital breath or soul.

==Characteristics==
Kingdom Animalia has several characteristics that set it apart from other living things.  Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and [[multicellular]], which separates them from [[bacteria]] and most [[protist]]s.  They are [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic]], generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from [[plant]]s and [[alga]]e.  They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking cell walls.

==Structure==
With a few exceptions, most notably the [[sponge|sponges]] (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings. Animals with this sort of organization are called metazoans, or [[eumetazoan]]s when the former is used for animals in general.

All animals have [[eukaryotic]] cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[shell]]s, [[bone]]s, and [[spicule]]s. During development it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms like plants and fungi have cells held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions: [[tight junction]]s, [[gap junction]]s, and [[desmosome]]s.

==Reproduction and development==

Nearly all animals undergo some form of [[sexual reproduction]].  Adults are [[diploid]] or occasionally [[polyploid]].  They have a few specialized reproductive cells, which undergo [[meiosis]] to produce smaller motile [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] or larger non-motile [[ovum|ova]].  These fuse to form [[zygote]]s, which develop into new individuals.

Many animals are also capable of [[asexual reproduction]].  This may take place through [[parthenogenesis]], where fertile eggs are produced without mating, or in some cases through fragmentation.

A [[zygote]] initially develops into a hollow sphere, called a [[blastula]], which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation.  In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge.  In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement.  It first [[invagination|invaginates]] to form a [[gastrula]] with a digestive chamber, and two separate [[germ layer]]s - an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.  In most cases, a mesoderm also develops between them.  These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.

Animals grow by indirectly using the energy of [[sunlight]].  Plants use this [[energy]] to turn air into simple [[sugars]] using a process known as [[photosynthesis]].  These sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow.  When animals eat these plants (or eat other animals which have eaten plants), the sugars produced by the plant are used by the animal.  They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.  This process is known as [[glycolysis]].

==Origin and fossil record==

Animals are generally considered to have evolved from [[flagellate]] protozoa.  Their closest living relatives are the [[choanoflagellate]]s, collared flagellates that have the same structure as certain sponge cells do.  Molecular studies place them in a supergroup called the [[opisthokont]]s, which also include the [[fungus|fungi]] and a few small parasitic [[protist]]s.  The name comes from the posterior location of the [[flagellum]] in motile cells, such as most animal sperm, whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella.

The first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the [[Precambrian]], around 600 million years ago, and are known as the [[Vendian biota]].  These are difficult to relate to later fossils, however.  Some may represent precursors of modern phyla, but they may be separate groups, and it is possible they are not really animals at all.  Aside from them, most known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during the [[Cambrian]] period, about 570 million years ago.  It is still disputed whether this event, called the [[Cambrian explosion]], represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible.

==Groups of animals==
[[Image:Elephant-ear-sponge.jpg|thumb|left|Elephant ear [[sponge]]]]
The sponges ([[Porifera]]) diverged from other animals early.  As mentioned, they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla.  Their cells are differentiated, but not organized into distinct tissues.  Sponges are sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through [[pore]]s. [[Archaeocyatha]], which have fused skeletons, may represent sponges or a separate phylum.

[[Image:Brain_coral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brain Coral]]]]
Among the eumetazoan phyla, two are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus.  These are the [[Cnidaria]], which include [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[jellyfish]], and the [[Ctenophora]] or comb jellies.  Both have distinct tissues, but they are not organized into [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].  There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm, with only scattered cells between them.  As such, these animals are sometimes called [[diploblastic]].  The tiny phylum [[Placozoa]] is similar, but individuals do not have a permanent digestive chamber.

The remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the [[Bilateria]].  For the most part, they are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs.  The body is [[triploblastic]], i.e. all three germ layers are well-developed, and tissues form distinct organs.  The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom.  There are exceptions to each of these characteristics, however - for instance adult [[echinoderm]]s are radially symmetric, and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.

[[Image:Common_clownfish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clownfish]] in their [[Sea Anemone]] home]]
Genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria.  Most appear to belong to four major lineages:
# [[Deuterostomes]]
# [[Ecdysozoa]]
# [[Platyzoa]]
# [[Lophotrochozoa]]

In addition to these, there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to have diverged before these major groups.  These include the [[Acoelomorpha]], [[Rhombozoa]], and [[Orthonectida]].  The [[Myxozoa]], single-celled parasites that were originally considered Protozoa, are now believed to have developed from the Bilateria as well.

[[Image:Magellanic-penguin02.jpg|thumb|left|the [[Magellanic Penguin]]]]
===Deuterostomes===
[[Deuterostome]]s differ from the other Bilateria, called [[protostome]]s, in several ways.  In both cases there is a complete digestive tract.  However, in protostomes the initial opening (the [[archenteron]]) develops into the mouth, and an anus forms separately.  In deuterostomes this is reversed.  In most protostomes cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes it forms through [[invagination]] of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching.  Deuterostomes also have a dorsal, rather than a ventral, nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage.

All this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages.  The main phyla of deuterostomes are the [[Echinodermata]] and [[Chordate|Chordata]].  The former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine, such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea cucumber]]s.  The latter are dominated by the [[vertebrate]]s, animals with backbones.  These include [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

In addition to these, the deuterostomes also include the [[Hemichordata]] or acorn worms.  Although they are not especially prominent today, the important fossil [[graptolite]]s may belong to this group.  The [[Chaetognatha]] or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but this is less certain.

===Ecdysozoa===
[[Image:Sympetrum flaveolum - side (aka).jpg|thumb|the [[Yellow-winged Darter]]]]
The [[Ecdysozoa]] are protostomes, named after the common trait of growth by moulting or [[ecdysis]].  The largest animal phylum belongs here, the [[Arthropoda]], including [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[crab]]s, and their kin.  All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages.  Two smaller phyla, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.

[[Image:roundworm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roundworm]]]]
The ecdysozoans also include the [[Nematoda]] or roundworms, the second largest animal phylum.  Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water.  A number are important parasites.  Smaller phyla related to them are the [[Nematomorpha]] or horsehair worms, which are visible to the unaided eye, and the [[Kinorhyncha]], [[Priapulida]], and [[Loricifera]], which are all microscopic.  These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.

The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the Spiralia, since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage.

[[Image:Bedford-s_flatworm.jpg|thumb|left|Bedford's [[Flatworm]]]]
===Platyzoa===
The [[Platyzoa]] include the phylum [[Platyhelminthes]], the flatworms.  These were originally considered some of the most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors.

[[Image:Rotifer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rotifer]]]]
A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the [[fluke]]s and [[tapeworm]]s.  Flatworms lack a coelom, as do their closest relatives, the microscopic [[Gastrotricha]].

The other platyzoan phyla are microscopic and pseudocoelomate.  The most prominent are the [[Rotifera]] or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments.  They also include the [[Acanthocephala]] or spiny-headed worms, the [[Gnathostomulida]], [[Micrognathozoa]], and possibly the [[Cycliophora]].  These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the [[Gnathifera]].

===Lophotrochozoa===
[[Image:Reef2063.jpg|thumb|Big Blue [[Octopus]]]]
The [[Lophotrochozoa]] include two of the most successful animal phyla, the [[Mollusca]] and [[Annelida]].  The former includes animals such as [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[squid]]s, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as [[earthworm]]s and [[leech]]es.  These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of [[trochophore]] larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods, because they are both segmented.  Now this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla.

The Lophotrochozoa also include the [[Nemertea]] or ribbon worms, the [[Sipuncula]], and several phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called a [[lophophore]].  These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates, but it now appears they are [[paraphyletic]], some closer to the Nemertea and some to the Mollusca and Annelida.  They include the [[Brachiopoda]] or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the [[Entoprocta]], the [[Phoronida]], and possibly the [[Bryozoa]] or moss animals.

==History of classification==
[[Image:Caerulea3 crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[White's Tree Frog]]]]
[[Image:R√∏d r√¶v (Vulpes vulpes).jpg|thumb|''Vulpes vulpes'', the [[red fox]]]]
[[Aristotle]] divided the living world between animals and [[plant]]s, and this was followed by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in the first hierarchical classification.  Since then biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships, and so these groups have been restricted somewhat.  For instance, microscopic [[protozoa]] were originally considered animals because they move, but are now treated separately.  

In [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of [[Vermes]], [[Insect]]a, [[Fish|Pisces]], [[Amphibia]], [[bird|Aves]], and [[Mammal]]ia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the [[chordate|Chordata]], whereas the various other forms have been separated out. The above lists represent our current understanding of the group, though there is some variation from source to source.

==Usage of the word ''animal''==
In everyday usage ''animal'' refers to any member of the [[animal kingdom]] that is not a [[human being]], and sometimes excludes [[insects]] (although including such arthropods as crabs). This confusion stems primarily from the familiarity with zoo animals, farm animals and pets, not from an analytical distinction between insects, humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Astronomy and Astrophysics''''' (abbreviated as ''A&amp;A'' in the astronomical literature, or else ''Astron. Astrophys.'') is a European Journal, publishing papers on theoretical, observational and instrumental [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]].  It was published by [[Springer-Verlag]] from [[1969]]-[[2000]], while [[EDP Sciences]] published the companion ''A&amp;A Supplement Series''.  In 2000, the two journals merged, with the combined journal known simply as ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', and published by EDP Sciences.

''A&amp;A'' is one of the major journals of astronomy, alongside the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]'', ''[[Astronomical Journal]]'' and the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]''.  While the first two are often the preferred journal of US-based researchers and the MNRAS is often the favoured journal for UK- and Commonwealth-based astronomers, A&amp;A tends to be the preferred journal of astronomers based in [[Europe]] (excluding the UK), particularly since page charges are waived for astronomers working in member countries.

''A&amp;A'' was created from the merger in 1969 of six major European astronomical journals     
* ''Annales d'Astrophysique'' (France), founded in 1938
* ''Arkiv for Astronomi'' (Sweden), founded in 1948
* ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands'', founded in 1921
* ''Bulletin Astronomique'' (France), founded in 1884
* ''Journal des Observateurs'' (France), founded in 1915
* ''Zeitschrift fur Astrophysik'' (Germany), founded in 1930
and extended in 1992 by the incorporation of:
* ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia'', founded in 1947

The '''Actinopterygii''' are the '''ray-finned [[fish]]'''. They are the dominant group of [[vertebrate]]s, with over 27,000 species ubiquitous throughout [[fresh water]] and [[ocean|marine]] environments.

==Classification==
Traditionally three grades of Actinopterygii have been recognized: the '''[[Chondrostei]]''', '''[[Holostei]]''', and '''[[Teleostei]]'''.  The second is [[paraphyletic]] and tends to be abandoned, however, while the first is now restricted to those forms closer to extant [[Chondrostei]] than to the other groups.  Nearly all fish alive today are teleosts.  A listing of the different groups is given below, down to the level of orders, arranged in what is believed to represent the evolutionary sequence down to the level of superorder.

[[Image:Einstein In Overcoat.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Albert Einstein photographed by Oren J. Turner in 1947.]]

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] ‚Äì [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] widely regarded as the greatest [[science|scientist]] of the 20th century. He was the author of the [[general theory of relativity]]  and made important contributions to the [[special theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. He was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] in 1905 (his &quot;[[Annus Mirabilis Papers|miracle year]]&quot;) and &quot;for his services to Theoretical Physics.&quot;

After British [[solar eclipse]] expeditions in 1919 confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in the exact amount he predicted in his [[general theory of  relativity]], Einstein became world-famous, an unusual achievement for a scientist. In his later years, his fame exceeded that of any other scientist in [[history of science and technology|history]]. In [[popular culture]], his name has become synonymous with great [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[genius]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Young Albert Einstein.jpg|thumb|left|222px|Young Einstein before the Einsteins moved from [[Germany]] to [[Italy]].]]
===Youth and college===
Einstein was born on [[March 14]], [[1879]] at [[Ulm]] in [[Baden-W√ºrttemberg]], [[German Empire]], about 100 km east of [[Stuttgart]]. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman who later ran an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] works, and Pauline, whose maiden name was Koch. They were married in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt. The family was [[Jew]]ish (non-observant); Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] and, at the insistence of his mother, was given [[violin]] lessons. Though he initially disliked (and eventually discontinued) the lessons, he would later take great solace in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[violin sonata]]s.

When Albert was five, his [[father]] showed him a pocket [[compass]], and Einstein realized that something in &quot;empty&quot; space acted upon the [[needle]]; he would later describe the experience as one of the most revelatory of his life. Though he built [[model (physical)|model]]s and [[machine|mechanical device]]s for fun and showed great mathematical faculty early on, he was considered a slow learner, possibly due to [[dyslexia]], simple [[shyness]], or the significantly rare and unusual structure of [[Albert Einstein's brain|his brain]] (examined after his death).{{rf|1|brain}} He later credited his development of the theory of relativity to this slowness, saying that by pondering space and time later than most children, he was able to apply a more developed intellect. Some researchers have speculated that Einstein may have exhibited some traits of mild forms of [[autism]], although they concede that a reliable posthumous diagnosis is impossible.{{rf|2|autism}}

In 1889, a student named Max Talmud introduced Einstein to key science and [[philosophy]] texts including [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by suggesting and providing books on science, mathematics and philosophy. 

Einstein attended the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] where he received a relatively progressive education.  He began to learn [[mathematics]] around age twelve: in 1891, he taught himself [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean plane geometry]] from a school booklet and began to study [[calculus]]. There is a recurring [[rumor]] that he failed mathematics later in his education, but this is untrue; a change in the way grades were assigned caused confusion years later. While there, he clashed with authority and resented the school regimen, believing the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such an endeavor as strict memorization.    

In 1894, following the failure of Hermann's electrochemical business, the Einsteins moved from [[Munich]] to [[Pavia, Italy]] (near [[Milan]]). Einstein's first scientific work was written therein (called &quot;''The Investigation of the State of [[Aether]] in [[Magnetic Field]]s''&quot;).  Albert remained behind in Munich lodgings to finish school, completing only one term before leaving the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in spring 1895 to rejoin his family in Pavia. He quit without telling his parents and a year and a half prior to final examinations, Einstein convinced the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor, but this meant he had no secondary-school certificate.{{rf|3|Highfield1}} That year, at the age of 16, he performed the [[thought experiment]] known as Albert Einstein's mirror. After gazing into a mirror, he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the [[speed of light]]; his conclusion that the speed of light is independent of the observer would later become one of the two [[postulates of special relativity]].  

Despite excelling in the mathematics and science portion, his failure of the liberal arts portion of the ''[[ETH Zurich|Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule]]'' (ETH, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in [[Zurich]]) entrance exam the following year was a setback; his family sent him to [[Aarau]], [[Switzerland]], to finish secondary school, where he studied the seldom-taught [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]] and received his diploma in September 1896. During this time he lodged with Professor Jost Winteler's family and became enamoured with Marie, their daughter, his first sweetheart. Albert's sister Maja was to later marry their son Paul, and his friend [[Michele Besso]] married their other daughter Anna.{{rf|4|Highfield2}} Einstein subsequently enrolled at the ''Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule'' in October and moved to Zurich, while Marie moved to [[Olsberg]] for a teaching post. The same year, he renounced his [[W√ºrttemberg]] citizenship and became [[stateless person|stateless]].

In the spring of 1896, the [[Serbia]]n [[Mileva Maric|Mileva Mariƒá]] started initially as a medical student at the [[University of Zurich]], but after a term switched to the same section as Einstein as the only woman that year to study for the same diploma. Einstein's relationship with Mileva developed into romance over the next few years.

In 1900, he was granted a teaching diploma by the ''Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule'' ([[ETH Zurich]]). Einstein then wrote his first published paper on the [[capillary action|capillary forces]] of a drinking straw, wherein he tried to unify the [[laws of physics]], an attempt he would continually make throughout his life. (It was titled &quot;''Folgerungen aus den Capillarit√§tserscheinungen'',&quot; which translated is &quot;''Consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena'',&quot; found in &quot;''Annalen der Physik''&quot; volume 4, page 513.) Shortly following, Einstein was accepted as a Swiss citizen in 1901; he kept his Swiss passport for his whole life. Through his friend Michelle Besso, an [[engineer]], he was presented with the works of [[Ernst Mach]] and later would consider him &quot;the best sounding board in Europe&quot; for physical ideas. During this time Einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends, including Besso and Mileva. The men referred to themselves as the &quot;Olympia Academy.&quot; He and Mileva had an illegitimate daughter [[Lieserl Einstein|Lieserl]], born in January 1902.

===Work and doctorate===
[[Image:Einstein patentoffice.jpg|frame|right||Einstein in 1905, when he wrote the &quot;''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers]]''&quot;]]

Upon graduation, Einstein could not find a teaching post, mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most of his professors. The father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant [[patent clerk|examiner]] at the Swiss Patent Office{{rf|5|www.ipi.ch.376}} in 1902. There, Einstein judged the worth of [[inventor]]s' [[patent]] applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand ‚Äî in particular he was chiefly charged to evaluate patents relating to electromagnetic devices.{{rf|6|Galison368}} He also learned how to discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions, and was taught by the director how &quot;to express [him]self correctly&quot;. He occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work.

Einstein married [[Mileva Mariƒá]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Einstein's marriage to Mariƒá, who was a mathematician, was both a personal and intellectual partnership: Einstein referred to Mileva as &quot;a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as I am&quot;.  [[Ronald W. Clark]], a biographer of Einstein, claimed that Einstein depended on the distance that existed in his and Mileva's marriage in order to have the solitude necessary to accomplish his work; he required intellectual isolation.  [[Abram Joffe]], a Soviet physicist who knew Einstein, in an obituary of Einstein, wrote, &quot;The author of [the papers of 1905] was ... a bureaucrat at the Patent Office in Bern, Einstein-Mariƒá&quot; and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship.  However, according to Alberto A. Mart√≠nez of the Center for Einstein Studies at Boston University, Joffe only ascribed authorship to Einstein, as he believed that it was a Swiss custom at the time to append the spouse's last name to the husband's name.{{rf|7|physicsweb.org.377}}  Whatever the truth, the extent of her influence on Einstein's work is a highly controversial and debated question.

On [[May 14]], [[1904]], the couple's first son, [[Hans Albert Einstein]], was born. In 1903, Einstein's position at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] had been made permanent, though he was passed over for promotion until he had &quot;fully mastered machine technology&quot;.{{rf|8|Galison370}} He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] after submitting his thesis &quot;''A new determination of molecular dimensions''&quot; (&quot;''Eine neue Bestimmung der Molek√ºldimensionen''&quot;) in 1905.

That same year, he wrote four articles that provided the foundation of modern physics, without much [[scientific literature]] to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories. Most physicists agree that three of those papers (on [[Brownian motion]], the [[photoelectric effect]], and [[special relativity]]) deserved [[Nobel Prize]]s. Only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the Nobel committee in the award. This is ironic, not only because Einstein is far better-known for relativity, but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon, and Einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] would take. In each of these papers, Einstein boldly took an idea from theoretical physics to its logical consequences and managed to explain experimental results that had baffled scientists for decades.

====Annus Mirabilis Papers====
{{details|Annus Mirabilis Papers}}

Einstein submitted the series of papers to the &quot;''Annalen der Physik''&quot;.  They are commonly referred to as the &quot;''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers]]''&quot; (from [[List of Latin phrases|''Annus mirabilis'']], [[Latin]] for 'year of wonders'). The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ([[IUPAP]]) commemorated the 100th year of the publication of Einstein's extensive work in 1905 as the '[[World Year of Physics 2005]]'.

The first paper, named &quot;''On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light''&quot;, (&quot;''√úber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt''&quot;) proposed that &quot;energy quanta&quot; (which are essentially what we now call [[photon]]s) were real, and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the [[photoelectric effect]].  This paper was specifically cited for his Nobel Prize. [[Max Planck]] had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black-body radiation law, published in 1901, but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick.  The photoelectric effect thus provided a simple confirmation of Max Planck's hypothesis of quanta.

His second article in 1905, named &quot;''On the Motion‚ÄîRequired by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat‚Äîof Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid''&quot;, (&quot;''[[√úber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W√§rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl√ºssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen]]''&quot;) covered his study of [[Brownian motion]], and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms. Before this paper, [[atom]]s were recognized as a useful concept, but [[physicist]]s and [[chemist]]s hotly debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave [[experimentalist]]s a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary [[microscope]]. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.  At the same time as Einstein, Brownian Motion was also described by [[Smoluchowski]].

Einstein's third paper that year, &quot;''On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies''&quot; (&quot;''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K√∂rper''&quot;), was published in September 1905. This paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], a theory of time, distance, mass and energy which was consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omitted the force of [[gravity]]. While developing this paper, Einstein wrote to Mileva about &quot;our work on relative motion&quot;, and this has led some to ask whether Mileva played a part in its development. A few historians of science believe that Einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous Frenchman [[Henri Poincar√©]] had already published the equations of Relativity, a few weeks  before Einstein submitted his paper; most believe their work independent, especially given Einstein's isolation at this time. 

A fourth paper, &quot;''Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?''&quot;, (&quot;''Ist die Tr√§gheit eines K√∂rpers von seinem Energieinhalt abh√§ngig?''&quot;) published late in 1905, showed one further deduction from relativity's [[axiom]]s, the famous equation that the [[energy]] of a body at rest (''E'') equals its mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: ''[[E=mc¬≤|E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;mc&amp;sup2;]]''. &lt;!-- whether this is correct or should be included seems dubious:  , this equation having been first correctly published by [[Henri Poincar√©]] (1900), for the case of mass equivalence of electromagnetic [[radiation]].  Max Planck(1907) questioned the reasoning in Einstein's derivation, and H.E.Ives(1953) called Einstein's derivation a tautology. --&gt;

===Middle years===
[[Image:Einstein 1911 Solvay.jpg|frame|right|Einstein at the 1911 [[Solvay Conference]].]] 

In 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class. In 1908, Einstein was licensed in [[Bern]], Switzerland, as a [[Privatdozent]] (unsalaried teacher at a university). Einstein's second son, [[Eduard Einstein|Eduard]], was born on [[July 28]], [[1910]]. At this time, he described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of [[critical opalescence]], which shows the cumulative effect of [[scattering]] of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere.[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/] In 1911, Einstein became first associate [[professor]] at the [[University of Zurich]], and shortly afterwards full professor at the (German) [[University of Prague]], only to return the following year to [[Zurich]] in order to become full professor at the [[ETH Zurich]]. At that time, he worked closely with the [[mathematician]] [[Marcel Grossmann]]. In 1912, Einstein started to refer to [[time]] as the [[fourth dimension]] (although [[H.G. Wells]] had done this earlier, in 1895 in ''[[The Time Machine]]'').

In 1914, just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]] as professor at the local [[University of Berlin|university]] and became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. He took German citizenship. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jew]]ish origins irritated German nationalists.  After he became world-famous, nationalistic hatred of him grew and for the first time he was the subject of an organized campaign to discredit his theories. From 1914 to 1933, he served as director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time that he was awarded his [[Nobel Prize]] and made his most groundbreaking discoveries. He was also an extraordinary professor at the [[Leiden University]] from 1920 until officially 1946, where he regularly gave guest lectures.

In 1917, Einstein published &quot;''On the Quantum Mechanics of Radiation''&quot; (&quot;''Zur Quantenmechanik der Strahlung''&quot;, Physkalische Zeitschrift 18, 121-128). This article introduced the concept of [[stimulated emission]], the physical principle that allows light amplification in the [[laser]]. He also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behavior of the entire universe, setting the stage for modern [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. In this work he created his self-described &quot;worst blunder&quot;, the [[cosmological constant]].

Einstein divorced Mileva on [[February 14]], [[1919]], and married his cousin [[Elsa L√∂wenthal]] (born Einstein: L√∂wenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]]. Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally). She was three years older than Albert, and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment; there were no children from this marriage. The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, Lieserl, is unknown. Some believe she died in infancy, while others believe she was given out for adoption.  They later had two sons: Eduard and Hans Albert. Eduard intended to practice as a [[psychoanalyst|Freudian analyst]] but was institutionalized for [[schizophrenia]] and died in an asylum. [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Albert]], his older brother, became a professor of [[hydraulic engineering]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], having little interaction with his father. 
[[Image:Einstein theory triumphs.png|thumb|left|222px|&quot;Einstein theory triumphs,&quot; declared the ''[[New York Times]]'' on [[November 10]] [[1919]].]]

====General relativity====
In November 1915, Einstein presented a series of lectures before the Prussian Academy of Sciences in which he described his theory of gravity, known as [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity, the Field Equation, which was first derived from a variational principle by [[David Hilbert]].  This theory considered all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it is in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]].  

The theory provided the foundation for the study of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were discovered well after Einstein's death.  A truly revolutionary theory, general relativity has so far passed every test posed to it and has become a powerful tool used in the analysis of many subjects in physics.

Initially, scientists were skeptical because the theory was derived by mathematical reasoning and rational analysis, not by experiment or observation.  But in 1919, predictions made using the theory were confirmed by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]]'s measurements (during a [[solar eclipse]]), of how much the light emanating from a star was [[Gravitational lens|bent]] by the [[Sun]]'s gravity when it passed close to the Sun, an effect called gravitational lensing. The observations were carried out on [[May 29]], [[1919]], at two locations, one in [[Sobral, Cear√°]], [[Brazil]], and another in the island of [[Principe]], in the west coast of [[Africa]]. On [[November 7]], ''[[The Times]]'' reported the confirmation, cementing Einstein's fame.  

Many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from disagreement with Einstein's interpretation of the experiments, to not being able to tolerate the absence of an absolute frame of reference.  In Einstein's view, many of them simply could not understand the mathematics involved.  Einstein's public fame which followed the 1919 article created resentment among these scientists some of which lasted well into the 1930s.

In the early 1920s Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.  On [[March 30]], [[1921]], Einstein went to [[New York City|New York]] to give a lecture on his new Theory of Relativity, the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Though he is now most famous for his work on relativity, it was for his earlier work on the [[photoelectric effect]] that he was given the Prize, as his work on general relativity was still disputed. The Nobel committee decided that citing his less-contested theory in the Prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community.

Sir Edmund Whittaker(1953) stated that [[David Hilbert]] published the theory of general relativity  ''nearly simultaneously'' with Einstein.

====The &quot;Copenhagen&quot; interpretation====
[[Image:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] sparred over [[quantum theory]] during the 1920s.]]
Einstein's postulation that light can be described not only as a wave with no kinetic energy, but also as massless discrete packets of energy called quanta with measurable kinetic energy (now known as photons) was a landmark break with the classical physics. In 1909 Einstein presented his first paper on the quantification of light to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.

In the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of [[quantum mechanics]], Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behaviour. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for a more &quot;complete&quot; explanation, i.e., more [[scientific determinism|deterministic]]. He could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern &quot;real things&quot;, the belief which had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity.

In a 1926 letter to [[Max Born]], Einstein made a remark that is now famous:
: ''Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.'' 

To this, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], who sparred with Einstein on quantum theory, retorted, &quot;Stop telling God what He must do!&quot; The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the [[Solvay Conference|Solvay conferences]]. 

Einstein was not rejecting probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein himself was a great statistician, using statistical analysis in his works on Brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before the miraculous year 1905; Einstein had even discovered [[Gibbs ensemble]]s. He believed, however, that at the core reality behaved [[scientific determinism|deterministically]]. Many physicists argue that experimental evidence contradicting this belief was found much later with the discovery of [[Bell's Theorem]] and [[Bell's inequality]]. Nonetheless, there is still space for lively discussions about the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].

====Bose-Einstein statistics====
In 1924, Einstein received a short paper from a young [[India]]n physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] describing light as a gas of photons and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in [[German language|German]] (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] now describe any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[boson]]s. The [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] phenomenon was predicted in the 1920s by Bose and Einstein, based on Bose's work on the statistical mechanics of photons, which was then formalized and generalized by Einstein. The first such condensate was produced by [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] in 1995 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. Einstein's original sketches on this theory were recovered in August 2005 in the library of [[Leiden University]].{{rf|10|www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl.378}}

Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr√∂dinger]] in the development of the [[quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the Bose-Einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper.

====The Einstein refrigerator====
[[Image:Einstein Refrigerator.png|thumb|right|222px|Einstein and [[Le√≥ Szil√°rd|Szil√°rd]]'s refrigerator  patent diagram.]]

Einstein and former student [[Le√≥ Szil√°rd]] co-invented a unique type of [[refrigeration|refrigerator]] (usually called the [[Einstein refrigerator]]) in 1926.{{rf|11|gtalumni.org.379}} On [[November 11]], [[1930]], {{US patent|1,781,541}} was awarded to Albert Einstein and Le√≥ Szil√°rd. The patent covered a thermodynamic refrigeration cycle providing cooling with no moving parts, at a constant [[pressure]], with only [[heat]] as an input. The refrigeration cycle used [[ammonia]], [[butane]], and [[water (molecule)|water]].

====World War II====
When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in January 1933, Einstein was a guest professor at [[Princeton University]], a position which he took in December 1932, after a invitation from the American educator, [[Abraham Flexner]]. In 1933, the [[Nazi]]s passed &quot;The Law of the Restoration of the Civil Service&quot; which forced all Jewish university professors out of their jobs, and throughout the 1930s a campaign to label Einstein's work as &quot;Jewish physics&quot;&amp;mdash;in contrast with &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Aryan physics&quot;&amp;mdash;was led by Nobel laureates [[Philipp Lenard]] and [[Johannes Stark]]. With the assistance of the [[SS]], the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' supporters worked to publish pamplets and textbooks denigrating Einstein's theories and attempted to politically [[blacklist]] German physicists who taught them, notably [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Einstein renounced his German citizenship and stayed in the [[United States]], where he was given permanent residency. He accepted a position at the newly founded [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in 1940, though he still retained Swiss citizenship.

In 1939, under the encouragement of Szil√°rd, Einstein [[Einstein-Szil√°rd letter|sent a letter]] to President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] urging the study of [[nuclear fission]] for military purposes, under fears that the Nazi government would be first to develop [[atomic weapon]]s. 
Roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein himself did not work on the bomb project, however.

The [[International Rescue Committee]] was founded 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein to assist opponents of Adolf Hitler.

For more information, see the section below on Einstein's [[#Political views|political views]].

====Institute for Advanced Study====
His work at the Institute for Advanced Study focused on the unification of the [[physical law|laws of physics]], which he referred to as the ''Unified Field Theory''. He attempted to construct a model which would describe all of the [[fundamental forces]] as different manifestations of a single force. This took the form of an attempt to unify the gravitational and electrodynamic forces. His attempt was hindered because the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s were not understood independently until around 1970, fifteen years after Einstein's death. Einstein's goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for [[Grand unification theory|unification of the forces]], embodied most notably by [[string theory]].

====Generalized theory==== 
Einstein began to form a [[generalized theory of gravitation]] with the Universal Law of Gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification of the fundamental forces. In 1950 he described his work in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article.  Einstein was guided by a belief in a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws. 

Einstein's Generalized Theory of Gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to field theory. He investigated reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident. Einstein tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism in a way that also led to a new subtle understanding of quantum mechanics.

Einstein postulated a four-dimensional space-time continuum expressed in axioms represented by five component vectors.  Particles appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. Einstein treated subatomic particles as objects embedded in the unified field, influencing it and existing as an essential constituent of the unified field but not of it. Einstein also investigated a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields, treating the combination of two parts of the field as being a natural procedure of the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately. He researched a way to delineate the equations and systems to be derived from a [[variational principle]].

Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalised theory of gravitation and was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts.  In particular, his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large, most notably the discovery of the [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]].

===Final years===
In 1948, Einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding of [[Brandeis University]]. A portrait of Einstein was taken by [[Yousuf Karsh]] on [[February 11]] of that same year. In 1952, the [[Israel]]i government proposed to Einstein that he take the post of second president. He declined the offer, and remains the only United States citizen ever to be offered a position as a foreign head of state. On [[March 30]], [[1953]], Einstein released a revised unified [[Field (physics)|field theory]].

He died at 1:15 AM[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/ein.html] in Princeton hospital[http://www.princetonhistory.org/museum_alberteinstein.cfm] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on [[April 18]], [[1955]] at the age of 76 from internal bleeding, which was caused by the rupture of an [[aortic aneurism]], leaving the Generalized Theory of Gravitation unsolved.  The only person present at his deathbed, a hospital nurse, said that just before his death he mumbled several words in [[German language|German]] that she did not understand. He was [[cremation|cremated]] without ceremony on the same day he died at [[Trenton, New Jersey]], in accordance with his wishes. His ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. 

An autopsy was performed on Einstein by Dr. [[Thomas Stoltz Harvey]], who removed and preserved [[Albert Einstein's brain|his brain]]. Harvey found nothing unusual with his brain, but in 1999 further analysis by a team at [[McMaster University]] revealed that his parietal [[Operculum (brain)|operculum]] region was missing and, to compensate, his inferior [[parietal lobe]] was 15% wider than normal.{{rf|12|news.bbc.co.uk.381}} The inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought, visuospatial cognition, and imagery of movement. Einstein's brain also contained 73% more [[glial cells]] than the average brain.

==Personality==
Albert Einstein was much respected for his kind and friendly demeanor rooted in his [[pacifism]].  He was modest about his abilities, and had distinctive attitudes and fashions‚Äîfor example, he minimized his wardrobe so that he would not need to waste time in deciding on what to wear. He was captivatingly simple, wearing mothy sweaters and sweatshirts and sans socks in his old age. He occasionally had a playful sense of humor, and enjoyed [[sailing]] and playing the [[violin]].  He was also the stereotypical bumbling &quot;[[absent-minded professor]]&quot;; he was often forgetful of everyday items, such as keys, and would focus so intently on solving physics problems that he would often become oblivious to his surroundings. In his later years, his appearance inadvertently created (or reflected) another stereotype of scientist in the process: the researcher with unruly white hair. 

===Religious views===
Although he was raised [[Jewish]], he was not a believer in the religious aspect of [[Judaism]], though he still considered himself a Jew. He simply admired the beauty of nature and the universe.  From a letter written in [[English language|English]], dated [[March 24]], [[1954]], Einstein wrote, ''&quot;It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.  If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.&quot;''

He also said (in an essay reprinted in ''Living Philosophies'', vol. 13, 1931): ''&quot;A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds‚Äîit is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity; in this sense, and this [sense] alone, I am a deeply religious man.&quot;''

The following is a response made to [[Rabbi Herbert Goldstein]] of the [[International Synagogue]] in [[New York City|New York]] which read, ''&quot;I believe in [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's God]] who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.&quot;'' After being pressed on his religious views by [[Martin Buber]], Einstein exclaimed, ''&quot;What we [physicists] strive for is just to draw His lines after Him.&quot;'' He also quoted once ''&quot;When I read the [[Bhagavad Gita]], I ask myself how God created the universe. Everything else seems superfluous.&quot;'' Summarizing his religious beliefs, he once said: ''&quot;My [[religion]] consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.&quot;''

Einstein was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] beginning in 1934, and was an admirer of [[Ethical Culture]].{{rf|13|ethicalculture.1}}

===Political views===
[[Image:Mikhoels and Einstein 1943.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Einstein and [[Solomon Mikhoels]], the chairman of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], in 1943.]]

Einstein considered himself a [[pacifism|pacifist]]{{rf|14|www.amnh.org.382}} and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]],{{rf|15|www.amnh.org.383}} and in later years, a committed democratic [[socialism|socialist]]. He once said, ''&quot;I believe [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi's]] views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time.  We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence for fighting for our cause, but by non-participation of anything you believe is evil.&quot;'' Einstein's views on other issues, including socialism, [[McCarthyism]] and [[racism]], were controversial. In a 1949 article entitled &quot;Why Socialism?&quot;,{{rf|16|socialism}} Albert Einstein described the &quot;predatory phase of human development&quot;, exemplified by a chaotic [[capitalism|capitalist]] society, as a source of evil to be overcome. He disapproved of the [[totalitarian]] regimes in the [[Soviet Union]] and elsewhere, and argued in favor of a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] system which would combine a [[planned economy]] with a deep respect for [[human rights]]. Einstein was a co-founder of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]] and a member of the [[AFL-CIO]]-affiliated union the [[American Federation of Teachers]].

Einstein was very much involved in the [[American Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights movement]]. He was a close friend of [[Paul Robeson]] for over 20 years.  Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups (including the Princeton chapter of the [[NAACP]]) many of which were headed by Paul Robeson. He served as co-chair with [[Paul Robeson]] of the ''American Crusade to End Lynching''. When [[W.E.B. DuBois]] was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the McCarthy era while he was in his 80s, Einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case. The case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity. Einstein was quoted as saying that &quot;racism is America's greatest disease&quot;. 

The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein ''&quot;believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'&quot;'', among other charges. They also alleged that Einstein ''&quot;was a member, sponsor, or affiliated with thirty-four [[communism|communist]] fronts between 1937-1954&quot;'' and ''&quot;also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations&quot;''.{{rf|17|foia.fbi.gov.384}} It should be noted that many of the documents in the file were submitted to the FBI, mainly by civilian political groups, and not actually written by FBI officials.

[[Image:EinsteinSzilard.jpg|thumb|left|222px|In 1939, Einstein signed a letter, written by [[Le√≥ Szil√°rd]], to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] arguing that the United States should start funding research into the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s.]]

Einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government, and for this reason (and his Jewish background), opposed the Nazi regime and fled Germany shortly after it came to power. At the same time, Einstein's [[libertarian socialism|anarchist]] nephew [[Carl Einstein]], who shared many of his views, was fighting the fascists in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and even sent a letter{{rf|18|hypertextbook.com.385}} to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] (dated [[August 2]], [[1939]], before [[World War II]] broke out, and probably written by [[Le√≥ Szil√°rd]]) encouraging him to initiate a program to create a nuclear weapon. Roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using [[uranium]] as a weapon, which in a few years was superseded by the [[Manhattan Project]].  

After the war, though, Einstein lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]]: &quot;I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth‚Äîrocks!&quot;{{rf|19|calaprice173}}

Einstein was a supporter of [[Zionism]]. He supported Jewish settlement of the ancient seat of Judaism and was active in the establishment of the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], which published (1930) a volume titled ''About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein'', and to which Einstein bequeathed his papers.  However, he opposed nationalism and expressed skepticism about whether a Jewish nation-state was the best solution.  He may have imagined Jews and Arabs living peacefully in the same land.  In later life, in 1952, he was offered the post of second president of the newly created state of [[Israel]], but declined the offer, claiming that he lacked the necessary people skills. Einstein was disturbed by the violence taking place in the Palestine after the Second World War and expressed that he was disappointed with the Jewish Ultra-Nationalist Organization ([[Irgun]] and Stern Gang). Nonetheless, Einstein remained deeply committed to the welfare of Israel and the Jewish people for the rest of his life.  

Einstein, along with [[Albert Schweitzer]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], fought against nuclear tests and bombs. As his last public act, and just days before his death, he signed the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], which led to the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]]. His letter to Russell read:

:Dear Bertrand Russell,

::Thank you for your letter of April&amp;nbsp;5. I am gladly willing to sign your excellent statement. I also agree with your choice of the prospective signers.

:With kind regards, A. Einstein

==Nationality: German, Swiss or American?==
Einstein was born a [[Germany|German]] citizen. At the age of seventeen, on [[January 28]], [[1896]], he was released from the German citizenship by his own request and with the approval of his father. He remained [[stateless person|stateless]] for five years.  On [[February 21]], [[1901]] he gained [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship, which he never revoked.  Einstein regained German citizenship in [[1914#January-April|April 1914]] when he entered German civil service, but due to the political situation and the persecution of Jewish people in [[Nazi Germany]], he left civil service in [[1933#March|March 1933]] and thus also lost the German citizenship.  On [[1940#September-October|October 1, 1940]], Einstein became an [[United States citizen|American citizen]]. He remained both an American and a Swiss citizen until his death on [[1955#April|April 18, 1955]].

==Popularity and cultural impact==
Einstein's popularity has led to widespread use of Einstein in [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]], including the registration of &quot;Albert Einstein&quot; as a [[trademark]]. 

[[Image:Einstongue.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The photo (detail from the original) of this humorous expression was taken during Einstein's [[birthday]] on [[March 14]], [[1951]], [[United Press International|UPI]].]]

===Entertainment===
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, [[film]]s and plays, including [[Jean-Claude Carrier]]'s 2005 French novel, Einstein S'il Vous Plait (Please Mr Einstein), [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film ''[[Insignificance (film)|Insignificance]]'', [[Fred Schepisi]]'s film ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'', [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel ''Einstein's Dreams'', and [[Steve Martin]]'s comedic play &quot;[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]&quot;.  He was the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 [[opera]] ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''.  His humorous side is also the subject of [[Ed Metzger]]'s one-man play ''[[Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian]]''.

He is often used as a model for depictions of [[mad scientists|eccentric scientist]]s in works of fiction; his own character and distinctive hairstyle suggest eccentricity, or even lunacy and are widely copied or exaggerated. [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine writer Frederic Golden referred to Einstein as &quot;a cartoonist's dream come true.&quot;

On Einstein's 72nd birthday in 1951, the [[UPI]] photographer Arthur Sasse was trying to coax him into smiling for the camera. Having done this for the photographer many times that day, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead.{{rf|20|www.mentalfloss.com.386}} The image has become an icon in pop culture for its contrast of the genius scientist displaying a moment of levity. [[Yahoo Serious]], an Australian film maker, used the photo as an inspiration for the intentionally anachronistic movie ''[[Young Einstein]]''.

===Licensing===
Einstein bequeathed his estate, as well as the use of his image (see [[personality rights]]), to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].{{rf|21|aip.org.387}} Einstein actively supported the university during his life and this support continues with the [[royalties]] received from licensing activities. [[The Roger Richman Agency]] [[licence|licences]] the commercial use of the name &quot;Albert Einstein&quot; and associated imagery and likenesses of Einstein, as [[agent (law)|agent]] for the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As head licensee the agency can control commercial usage of Einstein's name which does not comply with certain standards (e.g., when Einstein's name is used as a [[trademark]], the ‚Ñ¢ symbol must be used){{rf|22|refbot.388}}. As of May, 2005, the Roger Richman Agency was acquired by [[Corbis]].

===Honors===
[[Image:Einstein TIME Person of the Century.jpg|thumb|right|159px|Einstein on the cover of ''TIME'' as Person of the Century.]]

Einstein has received a number of posthumous honors. For example:
*In 1992, he was ranked #10 on [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100|list of the most influential figures in history]].
*In 1999, he was named ''Person of the Century'' by [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine.
*Also in 1999, [[Gallup]] recorded him as the fourth most [[Gallup's List of Widely Admired People|admired]] person of the 20th century.
*The year 2005 was designated as the &quot;[[World Year of Physics]]&quot; by [[UNESCO]] for its coinciding with the centennial of the &quot;[[Annus Mirabilis Papers|Annus Mirabilis]]&quot; papers, celebrated at the [[Einstein Symposium]].
Among Einstein's many namesakes are:
*a unit used in [[photochemistry]], the ''[[einstein (unit)|einstein]]''.
*the [[chemical element]] 99, [[einsteinium]].
*the [[asteroid]] [[2001 Einstein]].
*the [[Albert Einstein Peace Prize]].
*the  Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University{{rf|23|refbot.389}} was named after Einstein upon his death in 1955.
*the  Albert Einstein Medical Center{{rf|24|www.einstein.edu.390}} in [[Philadelphia]], PA.

{{ent|9|Thorne}} [[David Hilbert]] actually published the field equation in an article dated five days before Einstein's lecture. But according to Thorne (pp. 117&amp;ndash;118), Hilbert had discovered the correct derivation after &quot;mulling over things he had learned&quot; on a recent visit by Einstein to Gottingen. However Thorne goes on to say &quot;Quite naturally, and in accord with Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of warpage was quickly given the name the ''Einstein field equation'' rather than being named after Hilbert. Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps: the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime, the vision that the law of warpage must obey the reativity principle, and the first 90 percent of that law, the Einstein field equation. In fact without Einstein the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later.&quot;  See [[Priority disputes about Einstein and the relativity theories]] for more details.

'''Afghanistan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari-Persian]]: ÿßŸÅÿ∫ÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ, AfƒüƒÅnistƒÅn) is a [[landlocked]] country at the crossroads of [[Asia]]. Generally considered a part of [[Central Asia]], it is sometimes ascribed to a regional bloc in either [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]], as it has cultural, ethno-linguistic, and geographic links with most of its neighbors. It is bordered by [[Iran]] in the west, [[Pakistan]] in the south and east, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] in the north, and [[People's Republic of China|China]] to the east. It has a population of 30 million people, although this remains an estimate, as no official census has been taken for decades.

Afghanistan literally translates to 'land of the [[Afghan people|Afghans]]', but a plethora of other names have been applied to its general location in the past. Between the fall of the [[Taliban]] after the [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 Loya jirga]], Afghanistan was referred to by the Government of the United States as the ''Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan''. Under its new [[Constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], the country is now officially named the '''[[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]] of Afghanistan'''.

Population of Kabul: 1,424,400 (1988)
Land borders: 5,529 km

--&gt;
==Origin and history of the name==
The name of '''Afghanistan''' derives from  word ''[[Afghan people|Afghan]]''. The [[Pushtun]]s appear to have begun using the term Afghan as a name for themselves from the [[Islam |Islamic]] period onwards. According to W.K. Frazier Tyler, M.C. Gillet and several other scholars, ''&quot;The word  Afghan first appears in history in the [[Hudud ul-'alam min al-mashriq ila al-maghrib|Hudud-al-Alam]] in 982 AD.&quot;''

There are numerous views, regarding the origin of name Afghan, most of them being purely speculative as can be seen below:

Makhzan-i-Afghni by Nematullah written in 1612 CE, traces the Afghan or Pakhtun origin from the super-Patriarch [[Abraham]] down to one named King Talut or [[Saul]]. It states that Saul had a son Irmia (Jeremia), who had a son called Afghana. Upon the death of King Saul, Afghana was raised by David, and was later promoted to the chief command of the army during the reign of King [[Solomon]]. The progeny of this Afghana multiplied numerously, and came to be called ''Bani-Israel''. In the sixth century BCE, Bakhtunnasar, or [[Nebuchadnezzar]] king of [[Babul]], attacked [[Judah]] and exiled the progeny of Afghana to Ghor located in the center of what is now  Afghanistan. In course of time, the exiled community came to be addressed as ''Afghan'' after the name of their ancestor, and the country got its name as Afghanistan. This traditional view has many historical discrepancies, and is therefore not accepted by modern scholarship---the last pleader for the ''Bani-Israel'' hypothesis being Mayor Raverty (The Pathans, 1958, Olaf Caroe). 

Another version of Pushtun legend places Afghana, the professed eponymous ancestor of the Afghans or [[Pushtun]]s, as a contemporary of Muslim [[Prophet Mohammad]]. On hearing about the new faith of Islam, Qais from Aryana travelled to [[Medina]] to see the Muslim [[Muhammad |Prophet Muhammad]], and returned to Aryana as a Muslim. Qais Abdur Rashid purportedly had many sons, one of whom was Afghana. Afghana, in turn, had four sons who set out to the east to establish their separate lineages. The first son went to [[Swat]], the second to [[Lahore]] and [[India]], the third to [[Multan]], and the last one to [[Quetta]]. This legend is one of many traditional tales amongst the Pashtuns regarding their disparate origins. Again, it was this legendary Afghana who is stated to have given the  Pushtuns their current name. It is notable that the Afghan of this legend is separated from the Afghana of [[Solomon]]'s times by at least 11 centuries.
Dr H.W. Bellew, in his book  ''An Enquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan'', believes that the name ''Afghan'' derives from the [[Latin]] term ''Alban'', used by [[Armenians]] as ''Alvan'' or ''Alwan'', which refers to mountaineers, and in the case of transliterated Armenian characters, would be pronounced as ''[[Caucasian Albania|Aghvan]]'' or ''Aghwan''.  To the [[Persians]], this would further be altered to ''Aoghan'', ''Avghan'', and ''Afghan'' as a reference to the highlanders or &quot;mountaineers&quot; of the eastern [[Iranian plateau]]. 

Some people hold that the name derives from &quot;Abagan&quot;  (i.e without God) which term the  [[Persians]]  are stated to have coined for the [[Pushtun]]s to describe them as ''Godless or non-believers''. It is claimed that word ''Abagan'' is antonym of the word Bagan (=believer in God) just as word apolitical is [[antonym]] of  political in the English language. 

There are also a few people who link  &quot;Afghan&quot; to an [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] word &quot;''Avagan''&quot; said to mean &quot;original&quot;. Still others believe that the name derives from [[Sanskrit]]  ''upa-ganah'', said to mean &quot;allied tribes&quot;.  

Another etymological view is that the name ''Afghan'' evidently derives from  [[Sanskrit]] [[Ashvaka]] or [[Ashvakan]] (q.v),  the Assakenoi of [[Arrian]]. This view was propounded by J. W. McCrindle and is supported by numerous modern scholars (including C. Lassen, S. Martin, Bishop, Crooks, W. Crooke, J. C. Vidyalnar, M. R. Singh, P. Smith, N. L. Dey, Dr J. L. Kamboj, S. Kirpal Singh and several others).  In Sanskrit, word ''ashva'' ([[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''aspa'', [[Prakrit]] ''assa'') means &quot;horse&quot;, and ''ashvaka'' (Prakrit ''assaka'') means &quot;horseman&quot;. Pre-Christian times knew the people of eastern Afghanistan as ''Ashvakas'' ([[cavalry |horsemen]]), since they raised a fine breed of horses and had a reputation for providing expert [[cavalrymen]]. The fifth-century-BCE [[India]]n grammarian [[Panini]] calls them ''Ashvayana'' and ''Ashvakayana''. Classical writers use the respective equivalents ''Aspasios'' (or Aspasii, Hippasii) and ''Assakenois'' (or Assaceni/Assacani, Asscenus). The Aspasios/Assakenois (= Ashvakas = cavalrymen) is stated to be another name for the [[Kambojas]] because of their [[equestrian]] characteristics  (see [[List of country name etymologies]]).

The last part of the name ''Afghanistan'' originates from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''st&amp;#257;n'' (''country'' or ''land''). The English word ''Afghanland'' that appeared in various treaties between [[Qajars|Qajar-Persia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] dealing with the Eastern lands of the Persian kingdom (modern Afghanistan) was adopted by the Afghans and became ''Afghanistan''.

Before being called 'Afghanistan', the region had gone through several name changes in its long history of around 5000 years. One of the most ancient names, according to historians and scholars, was ''Ariana'' - the Greek pronunciation of the ancient [[Avestan]] ''Aryanam Vaeja'' or the [[Sanskrit]] &quot;Aryavarta&quot;, ''Land of the [[Aryans]]''. Today this Old-Persian, and [[Avestan]] expression is preserved in the name ''[[Iran]]'' and it is noted in the name of the Afghan national airline, ''[[Ariana Airlines]]''. The term 'Ariana Afghanistan' is still popular amongst Persian speakers in the country.

Many centuries later, Afghanistan was part of [[Greater Khorasan]], and hence was recognized with the name [[Khorasan]] (along with regions centered around [[Merv]] and [[Neishabur]]), which in [[Pahlavi]] means &quot;The Eastern Land&quot; (ÿÆÿßŸàÿ± ÿ≤ŸÖ€åŸÜ in Persian). ''([[Dehkhoda]], p8457)''

==History==
{{main|History of Afghanistan}}

Afghanistan exists at a unique nexus-point where numerous Eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region today known as ''Afghanistan'' has been invaded by a host of peoples, including the [[Indo-Iranians|Aryans]], [[Medes]], [[Achaemenids|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryans]], [[Kushans]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanians]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[British]], and [[Soviets]], but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region. On other occasions, native Afghan entities have invaded surrounding regions to form empires of their own.

Between 2000 and 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], waves of [[Indo-European]]-speaking [[Indo-Iranians|Aryans]] are thought to have flooded into modern-day Afghanistan, setting up a nation that became known as ''AryƒÅnƒÅm X≈°aŒ∏ra'', or &quot;Land of the Aryans.&quot; [[Zoroastrianism]] is speculated to have possibly originated in Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BCE. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages such as [[Avestan]] may have been spoken in Afghanistan around a similar time-line with the rise of Zoroastrianism. Around 1000 BCE (or earlier), the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] [[Vedic]] civilization may have arisen near the vicinity of the [[Kabul]] valley of eastern Afghanistan, but this remains speculative as more viable theories based upon archaeological finds tend to support the emergence of the Vedic civilization east of the [[Indus]] and/or [[Ganges]] in what is today Pakistan and India. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenids|Persian Empire]] supplanted the [[Medes]] and incorporated Aryana within its boundaries; and by 330 BCE, Alexander the Great had invaded the region. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the Hellenic successor states of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Bactrians]] controlled the area, while the [[Maurya]]ns from India annexed the southeast for a time and introduced [[Buddhism]] to the region until the area returned to the Bactrian rule.

During the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Kushan]]s, a [[Tocharian]] people from Central Asia with Indo-European origins, occupied the region. Thereafter, Aryana fell to a number of Eurasian tribes &amp;mdash; including [[Parthians]], [[Scythians]], and [[Hepthalites|Huns]], as well as the [[Sassanian]] Persians and local rulers such as the [[Hindu]] [[Shahi]]s in Kabul &amp;mdash; until the 7th century CE, when Muslim [[Arab]] armies invaded the region.

The Arabs initially annexed parts of western Afghanistan in 652 and then conquered most of the rest of Afghanistan between 706-709 CE and administered the region as [[Khorasan]], and over time much of the local population converted to Islam, but retained their [[Iranian languages]]. Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]] (962-1151), founded by a local [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ruler from [[Ghazni]] named [[Mahmud Ghaznavi|Yamin ul-Dawlah Mahmud]], that expanded its suzerainty over a vast area from [[Kurdistan]] to northern India. This empire was replaced by the Ghorid Empire (1151-1219), founded by another local ruler, this time of [[Tajik]] extraction, [[Muhammad Ghori]], whose domains included huge parts of Central and South Asia, and laid the foundations for the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in India.

In 1219, the region was overrun by the Mongols under [[Genghis Khan]], who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]]s, and was extended further following the invasion of [[Tamerlane]] (Timur Leng), a ruler from Central Asia. By 1400, all of Afghanistan came under his dominion, and he also laid the foundation of another Islamic empire in India, the [[Mughal Empire]]. The [[Uzbek]]-born [[Babur]], a descendant of both Tamerlane and Genghis Khan, established an empire with its capital at Kabul by 1504, and then expanded into South Asia in 1525 and established the Mughal Empire's rule throughout much of what is today Pakistan and northern India by 1527. As the empire shifted eastward, the [[Safavids]] of Persia challenged Mughal rule while the two superpower empires of the day battled over the fate of Afghanistan for decades with the Persians acquiring the area by the mid-17th century.

Local [[Ghilzai]] Pashtun tribesmen, lead by Khan Nashir, successfully overthrew Safavid rule, and under the [[Hotaki]] dynasty, briefly controlled all or parts of Persia itself from 1722 to 1736. Following a brief period under the rule (1736-1747) of the Turko-Iranian conqueror [[Nadir Shah]], one of his high-ranking military officers, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]], himself a Pashtun tribesman of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] clan, called for a ''loya jirga'' following Nadir Shah's assassination (for which many implicate Abdali) in 1747. The Afghans/Pashtuns came together at Kandahar in 1747 and chose Ahmad Shah, who changed his last name to Durrani (meaning 'pearl of pearls' in Persian), to be king. The Afghanistan nation-state as it is known today came into existence in 1747 as the [[Durrani Empire]], and expanded outward from traditional Pashtun territories to include all of what is today Afghanistan, a portion of [[Mashad]] in Iran, and all of Pakistan and Kashmir as well. The Durrani Empire lasted for nearly a century until internecine conflict and wars with the Persians and [[Sikhs]] diminished their empire by the early 19th century. However, the current borders of Afghanistan would not be determined until the coming of the British.

During the 19th century, following the [[Anglo-Afghan wars]] (fought in 1839-1842, 1878-1880, and lastly in 1919), Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the [[United Kingdom]]. The United Kingdom exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King [[Amanullah]] acceded to the throne in 1919 (see &quot;[[The Great Game]]&quot;) that Afghanistan regained complete independence. During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]], and this would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and [[British India]], and later the new state of Pakistan, over what came to be known as the [[Pashtunistan]] debate.

The historical rulers of Afghanistan were part of the Abdali tribe of the ethnic Afghans, whose name was changed to [[Durrani]] upon the accession of [[Ahmad Shah]]. They belonged to the Saddozay segment of the [[Popalzay]] clan, or to the Mohammadzay segment of the Barakzay clan, of the ethnic Afghans. The Mohammadzay frequently furnished the Sadozay kings with top counselors, who served occasionally as regents, and identified with the name Mohammadzay.

Since 1900, eleven monarchs and rulers have been unseated through undemocratic means: in 1919 (assassination), 1929 (abdication), 1929 (execution), 1933 (assassination), 1973 (deposition), 1978 (execution), 1979 (execution), 1979 (execution), 1987 (removal), 1992 (overthrow), 1996 (overthrow) and 2001 (overthrow).

The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was between 1933 and 1973, when the country was under the rule of King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]. However, in 1973, Zahir's brother-in-law, [[Sardar Mohammed Daoud]] launched a bloodless coup. Daoud and his entire family were murdered in 1978 when the [[communist]] [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] launched a coup known as the [[Khalq|Great Saur Revolution]] and took over the government.

Opposition against, and conflict within, the series of communist governments that followed, was considerable. As part of a [[Cold War]] strategy, the US government began to covertly fund and train anti-government [[Mujahideen]] forces through the Pakistani secret service agency known as Inter Services Intelligence or ISI, which were derived from discontented Muslims in the country who opposed the official atheism of the Marxist regime, in 1978. In order to bolster the local Communist forces the [[Soviet Union]] - citing the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries in 1978 - intervened on [[December 24]], 1979. The Soviet occupation resulted in a mass exodus of over 5 million Afghans who moved into refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. More than 3 million alone settled in Pakistan. Faced with mounting international pressure and the loss of approximately 15,000 Soviet soldiers as a result of Mujahideen opposition forces trained by the [[United States]], Pakistan, and other foreign governments, the Soviets withdrew ten years later, in 1989. For more details, see [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].

The Soviet withdrawal was seen as an ideological victory in the US, which ostensibly had backed the Mujahideen in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]]. Following the removal of the Soviet forces in 1989, the US and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country. The USSR continued to support the regime of Dr. Najubullah (formerly the head of the secret service, Khad) until its downfall in 1992. However, the absence of the Soviet forces resulted in the downfall of the government as it steadily lost ground to the guerrilla forces. [http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0856490.html]

As the vast majority of the elites and intellectuals had either been systematically eliminated by the Communists, or escaped to take refuge abroad, a dangerous leadership vacuum came into existence. Fighting continued among the various Mujahidin factions, eventually giving rise to a state of [[warlordism]]. The chaos and corruption that dominated post-Soviet Afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the [[Taliban]] in response to the growing chaos. The most serious fighting during this growing civil conflict occurred in 1994, when 10,000 people were killed during factional fighting in Kabul.

Exploiting the chaotic situation in Afghanistan, a few regional bedfellows including fundamentalist Afghans trained in refugee camps in western Pakistan, the Pakistani secret intelligence service (ISI), the regional Mafia (well-established network that smuggled mainly Japanese electronics and tyres before the Russian invasion, now involved in drug smuggling) and Arab extremist groups (that were looking for a safe operational hub) joined forces and helped to create the [[Taliban]] movement (Rashid 2000).[http://www.ahmedrashid.com/] Backed by Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and other strategic allies, the Taliban developed as a politico-religious force, and eventually seized power in 1996. The Taliban were able to capture 90% of the country, aside from the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] strongholds primarily found in the northeast in the [[Panjshir Valley]]. The Taliban sought to impose a strict interpretation of [[Islam]]ic ''[[Sharia]]'' law and gave safe haven and assistance to individuals and organizations that were implicated as terrorists, most notably [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[Al-Qaeda]] network.

The United States and allied military action in support of the opposition following the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks]] forced the Taliban's downfall. In late 2001, major leaders from the Afghan opposition groups and diaspora met in [[Bonn]], and agreed on a [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|plan]] for the formulation of a new government structure that resulted in the inauguration of [[Hamid Karzai]] as Chairman of the [[Afghan Interim Authority]] (AIA) on December 2001. After a nationwide ''[[Loya Jirga]]'' in 2002, Karzai was elected President.

On [[March 3]] and [[March 25]] [[2002]], a series of earthquakes struck Afghanistan, with a loss of thousands of homes and over 1800 lives. Over 4000 more people were injured. The earthquakes occurred at Samangan Province ([[March 3]]) and Baghlan Province ([[March 25]]). The latter was the worse of the two, and caused most of the casualties. International authorities assisted the Afghan government in dealing with the situation.

As the country continues to rebuild and recover, as of late 2005, it was still struggling against widespread poverty, continued warlordism, a virtually non-existent infrastructure, possibly the largest concentration of land mines on earth and other unexploded ordinance, as well as a sizable illegal poppy and heroin trade.  Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying, and the nation's first elections were successfully held in 2004 as women parliamentarians were selected in record numbers. Parliamentary elections in 2005 helped to further stabilize the country politically, in spite of the numerous problems it faced, including inadequate international assistance. The country continues to grapple with occasional acts of violence from a few remaining [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] and the instability caused by warlords.

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Afghanistan]]''

Afghanistan is currently led by president [[Hamid Karzai]], who was elected in October of 2004. Before the election, Karzai led the country after having been hand-picked by the administration of [[United States]]' [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] to head an interim government, after the fall of the Taliban. His current cabinet includes members of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], and a mix from other regional and ethnic groups formed from the transitional government by the [[Loya jirga]] (grand council). Former [[monarch]] [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] returned to the country, but was not reinstated as king, and only exercises limited ceremonial powers.

Under the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] the [[Afghan Constitution Commission]] was established to consult with the public and formulate a draft constitution. The meeting of a constitutional ''loya jirga'' was held in December 2003, when a new constitution was adopted creating a presidential form of government with a bicameral legislature.

Troops and [[intelligence agencies]] from the United States and a number of other countries are present, some to keep the peace, others assigned to hunt for remnants of the [[Taliban]] and [[al Qaeda]]. A [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force called the [[International Security Assistance Force]] has been operating in Kabul since December 2001. [[NATO]] took control of this Force on [[August 11]], [[2003]]. Some of the country remains under the control of warlords. [http://www.newstatesman.com/200502070006]

On [[March 27]], [[2003]], Afghan deputy defense minister and powerful warlord General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] created an office for the [[North Zone of Afghanistan]] and appointed officials to it, defying then-interim president [[Hamid Karzai]]'s orders that there be no zones in Afghanistan.

[[Eurocorps]] took over the responsibility for the NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in Kabul [[August 9]], [[2004]].

[[Afghan presidential election, 2004|National elections]] were held on [[October 9]], [[2004]]. Over 10 million Afghans were registered to vote. Most of the 17 candidates opposing Karzai [[boycott]]ed the election, charging fraud; [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1354517,00.html] an independent commission found evidence of fraud, but ruled that it did not affect the outcome of the poll. Karzai won 55.4% of the vote. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3977677.stm] He was inaugurated as president on [[December 7]]. It was the country's first national election since 1969, when parliamentary elections were last held.

On [[September 18]] [[2005]], [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|parliamentary elections]] were held; the [[Wolesi Jirga|parliament]] opened on the following [[December 19]].
On [[December 20]] Karzai's close ally and president of the first [[mujahideen]] government, [[Sibghatullah Mojadeddi]], was picked to head the 102-seat upper house.
On [[December 21]], [[Yunus Qanuni]], Afghan opposition leader and Karzai's main opponent was chosen to lead the 249-seat lower house of parliament with 122 votes against 117 for his closest challenger.

==Geography==
[[Image:Afghanistan map.png|framed|Map of Afghanistan]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Afghanistan]]''

Afghanistan is a land-locked [[mountain]]ous country, with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point, at 7485 m (24,557 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level, is [[Nowshak]]. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. Afghanistan has a continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to [[earthquake]]s.

The major cities of Afghanistan are its capital Kabul, [[Herat]], [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]] and [[Kandahar]].

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Afghanistan]]''

Afghanistan is an extremely impoverished country, being one of the world's poorest and least developed countries. Two-thirds of the population lives on less than US$2 a day. The economy has suffered greatly from the recent political and military unrest since the 1979-80 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 1998-2001.

About 70 percent of the population is under 30 according to Asian Development Bank. The total fertility rate is 6.8, the highest in South Asia (with a regional average at 3.3), but so are mortality rates. Infant mortality rate is 166 per 1000 births. The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). While there are no official unemployment rate estimates available, it is evident that it is high. The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. (Fujimura, 2004a). [http://www.adbi.org/research-policy-brief/2004/10/15/698.afghan.economy.after.election/]

The country's natural resources include copper, zinc and iron ore in central areas; precious and semi-precious stones such as lapis, emerald and azure in the north-east and east; and (unproved) oil and gas reserves in the north. However, &quot;its significant mineral resources remain largely untapped because of the Afghan War of the 1980s and subsequent fighting&quot; (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2005). A good portion of Afghanistan GDP comes from illicit drugs including opium, its derivtives morphine and heroin and hashish.

On a positive note, international efforts to rebuild Afghanistan led to the formation of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) as a result of the December 2001 [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)| Bonn Agreement]], and later addressed at the Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002, where $4.5 billion was committed in a trust fund to be administered by the [[World Bank Group]]. Priority areas for reconstruction include the rebuilding of education system, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector, and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.

According to a 2004 report by the Asian Development Bank, the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development (Fujimura, 2004b). But macroeconomic planning and management at present is hampered by poor information, weak service delivery systems, and less than adequate law enforcement.

The country has been going through economic recovery since the Taliban were overthrown in October 2001. However, estimating Afghanistan's economy is problematic as it is impossible to gather reliable statistics while it is going through a significant change period in all fronts, with the added problem of less than ideal security situation. The best estimate that can be relied upon is that of the Central Statistical Office in 2003, from which the CIA Factbook seems to have drawn some data. Accordingly, the country's estimated gross domestic product (GDP) was $21.5 billion in 2003, a 28.6% growth over 2002 (CIA Factbook 2003) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html] 

Among the 232 listed countries in the CIA Factbook, Afghanistan ranks 108th in terms of GDP, which means per capita income of $800. A brief comparison shows that Afghanistan is the poorest country among its neighbors. Pakistan, with a GDP of $347 billion in 2003 had a per capita purchasing power of $2200 and Iran with its $517 billion had $7700. In the north, Turkmenistan had a GDP of $27.6 billion and a per capita income of $5700, Uzbekistan with its $48 billion had $1800, and Tajikistan despite a low GDP of only $8 billion had a per capita income of $1100 per head. The World Bank estimates that Afghanistan will remain in need of external financial help before it can stand on its own feet economically.

Ironically, Afghanistan's GDP ranks approximately at the same level as Jordan ($25.5bn) and Qatar ($19.5bn). However, considering that those oil-rich Arab states have smaller populations, Jordan per capita income amounts to $4500 and Qatar's to $23,200.

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over two million refugees from neighbouring countries and the West, who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed capital to start up small businesses. What is also helping is the estimated $2-3 billion in international assistance, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. 

While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the &quot;donor money&quot;, only a small portion - about 15% - is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the UN system and NGOs. It needs to be mentioned that there are some (as yet unconfirmed) claims that most of this money is spent on the expenses of the UN and other non-governmental organizations as well as being funneled into illegitimate activities.

The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible. 

Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old afghani by 1 new afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003 (Fujimura, 2004c).

The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels and according to accepted international norms. A new law on private investment provides 3-7 year tax holidays to eligible companies and a 4-year exemption from exports tariffs and duties.

While these improvements will help rebuild a strong basis for the nation in the future, for now, the majority of the population continues to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, medical care, and other problems exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. The government is not strong enough to collect customs duties from all the provinces due to the power of the warlords. Fraud is widespread and ‚Äúcorruption is rife within all Afghan government organs, and central authority is barely felt in the lawless south and south-west‚Äù (The Economist, 2005). [http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4494134]

Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade is another huge problem for the country. The CIA estimates that one-third of the country's GDP comes from opium export, although the Asian Development Bank states a lower figure, namely $2.5 billion (12% of the GDP). At any rate, this is not only one of Kabul's most serious policy and law-enforcement challenges[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html], but also one of the world's most serious problems. 

The problem began with the Soviet invasion in 1979-80. As the government began to lose control of provinces, &quot;warlordism&quot; flourished and with it opium production as regional commanders searched for ways to generate money to purchase weapons, according to the UN. [http://www.irinnews.org/webspecials/opium/Chronology.asp] (At this time the West was pursuing an &quot;arms-length&quot; supporting strategy of the Afghan freedom-fighters or Mujahidin, the main purpose being to cripple the USSR slowly into withdrawal rather than a quick and decisive overthrow).

When the West abandoned Afghanistan after its perceived victory over the Soviet Union as the Red Army was forced to withdraw in 1989, a power vacuum was created. Various Mujahidin factions started fighting against each other for power. With the discontinuation of Western support, they resorted ever more to poppy cultivation to finance their military existence.

The regional mafia, who were looking for a safe operational hub, joined forces with the more fanatic sections of the Mujahidin supported by Arab extremists like Osama bin Laden as well as the Pakistani secret intelligence service [[ISI]] to form the [[Taliban]] movement towards the end of 1994 (Rashid, 2000); [http://www.ahmedrashid.com/] see also BBC report here [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1569826.stm].

The Taliban, having taken control of 90% of the country, actively encouraged poppy cultivation. With this, they not only fulfilled their promises and obligations to their partners - the regional mafia - but also increased their own desperately needed income through taxes. According to the above UN source, Afghanistan saw a bumper opium crop of 4,600 million tonnes in 1999, which was the height of the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. When they came under extreme international diplomatic pressure in 2002, they initiated a ban on poppy cultivation.

Following the US-led coalition war that led to the defeat of the [[Taliban]] in November 2001 which essentially collapsed the economy, the relatively few other sources of revenue forced many of the country's farmers to resort back to growing cash crops for export. A notable example of such a crop is the [[opium poppy]] (1,300 km&amp;sup2; in 2004 according to the [[United Nations]] Office on Drugs and Crime), the cultivation of which has largely increased during the last decade: Afghanistan has become the first illicit opium producer in the world, before [[Burma]] ([[Myanmar]]), part of the so-called &quot;[[Golden Triangle]]&quot;. 

The main obstacle to eradicating poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is the US forces' need for the warlords and their forces in hunting terrorists. The warlords are the major culprits in poppy cultivation, but are also highly useful to the US forces in scouting, providing local intelligence, keeping their own territories clean from Al-Qaeda and Taliban insurgents, and even taking part in military operations - all for money. This also contributes to the lack of central government's real authority in provinces and discourages farmers from growing grain and fruit as they did for centuries previously.

In short, the Afghan economy is currently (December 2005) going through a hefty change period. On the one hand, there are encouraging signs of positive development and increasing wealth creation and management. But on the other hand, the security situation, the lingering war against terrorism and the opium problem have created tall barriers for Afghanistan to rejoin the international community in prosperity and economic development.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Afghanistan]]''

The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups largely composed of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. Because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are not available.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3717092.stm] Therefore most figures are approximations only. According to the CIA World FactBook (updated on [[17 May]] [[2005]]), an approximate ethnic group distribution is as follows:

[[Pashtun]] 30%, [[Tajiks|Tajik]] 29%,, [[Hazara]] 22%, [[Uzbek]] 11%, [[Aimak]] 5%, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] 3%, [[Baloch]] 2%, other 4% including sikhs.[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html#People]

The CIA factbook on languages in Afghanistan refers to the official languages of Afghanistan as being [[Persian language|Persian]] (local name: [[Dari]]) 50% and [[Pashtu]] 35%. Other languages include [[Turkic language]]s (primarily [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]) 11%, 30 minor languages (primarily [[Balochi]] and [[Pashai]]) 4%. Bilingualism is common.

Religiously, Afghans are overwhelmingly [[Muslim]] (approximately 80% [[Sunni]] and 19% [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]]). There are also small [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] minorities. Afghanistan was once home to a many-centuries-old [[Jew]]ish minority, numbering approximately 5,000 in 1948. Most Jewish families fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual remains today, [[Zablon Simintov]]. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39702-2005Jan26.html] With the fall of the Taliban a number of [[Sikhs]] have returned to the [[Ghazni]], [[Nangarhar]], [[Kandahar]] and [[Kabul]] Provinces of Afghanistan.

==Constitution==
''Main article: [[Constitution of Afghanistan]]''

According to the 2004 constitution, Afghanistan is run by a president, who is elected by direct popular vote to a five-year term. The president may only serve two terms. A candidate for president must be at least forty years of age, a Muslim, and a citizen of Afghanistan. The country has two vice-presidents. The president serves as head of state and government, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president makes appointments for his cabinet, as well as posts in the military, police force, and provincial governorships, with the approval of parliament.

The legislative body of Afghanistan is a parliament consisting of two houses: the ''[[Wolesi Jirga]]'' (House of the People) and the ''[[Meshrano Jirga]]'' (House of Elders). The ''Wolesi Jirga'' consists of up to 250 members elected to five-year terms through direct elections in proportion to the population of each province. At least two women must be elected from each province. In the ''Meshrano Jirga'', one-third of the members are elected by provincial councils for four years, one-third are elected by district councils of each province for three years, and one-third are appointed by the president for five years, of whom half must be women.

The judicial system of Afghanistan consists of the ''[[Stera Mahkama]]'' (Supreme Court), appeals courts, and lower district courts designated by law. The ''Stera Mahkama'' is made up of nine judges appointed by the president, with the approval of parliament, to a ten-year term. Judges must be at least forty years of age, not belong to a political party, and have a degree in law or Islamic jurisprudence. The ''Stera Mahkama'' can judge the constitutionality of all laws in the country.

==Culture==
''Main article: [[Culture of Afghanistan]]''

Afghans display pride in their country, ancestry, military prowess, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their clan loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. (Heathcote, 2003). As clan warfare / internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.

Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Buddha]] in the [[Bamiyan Province]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. Other famous sites include the very cities of [[Herat]], [[Ghazni]] and [[Balkh]]. The [[Minaret of Jam]], in the [[Hari Rud]] valley, is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].

The people of Afghanistan are prominent horsemen as the national [[sport]] is [[Buzkashi]]. [[Afghan hound]]s (a type of running [[dog]]s) also originated in Afghanistan.

Although literacy levels are very low, classic Persian poetry plays a very important role in Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in both Iran and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Private poetry competition events known as ‚Äúmusha‚Äôera‚Äù are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every home owns one or more poetry collection of some sort, even if it is not read often.

The Afghan dialect of the Persian language [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] derives from &quot;Farsi-e Darbari&quot;, meaning 'Persian of the royal courts'. It is regarded by some scholars as the more original version of the language. Iran, having a larger population, a stronger economy and closer ties to the rest of the world has developed its language further in the course of history. Afghanistan took a more conservative approach mainly due to lack of resources. As a result, Dari has not changed much over the last few centuries.

Many of the famous Persian language poets of 10th to 15th centuries stem from what is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy. Examples are Mawlvi Balkhi ([[Rumi]]), born and educated in the Balkh province in the 13th century and moved to today‚Äôs Istanbul, [[Sanaayi]] Ghaznavi (12th century, native of Ghazni provice), [[Jami]] Heravi (15th century, native of Jam-e-Herat in western Afghanistan), [[Alisher Navoi|Nizam ud-Din Ali Sher Heravi Nava'i,]] (15th century, Heart province). Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-know in both Iran and Afghanistan includes [[Ustad Behtab]], [[Khalilullah Khalili]] [http://www.afghanmagazine.com/arts/khalili/khalili.html], Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari [http://www.afghanmagazine.com/jan2000/music/kharaabat/], [[Parwin Pazwak]] and others.

In addition to poets, the region of Afghanistan produced numerous scientists as well including [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina Balkhi) who hailed from [[Balkh]]. Avicenna, who travelled to [[Isfahan]] later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as &quot;the father of modern medicine&quot;. George Sarton called Ibn Sina &quot;the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times.&quot; His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'' and ''The Canon of Medicine'', also known as the Qanun. Avicenna's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through Noah Gordon's The Physician [http://www.noahgordonbooks.com/index.html], now published in many languages.

Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the [[Nauroz]]-celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the 20th century has been likened to [[Vienna]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is certainly as potent in political terms as the national state system of Europe 1914. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders (Khans) in the same way that men throughout Europe &quot;flocked to the colours&quot; in 1914, forming up in regional divisions and battalions under the command of the local nobility and gentry. In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call ([[Ulul-Amr]]), but this was no more needed than was enforced conscription to fill the ranks of the British Army in 1914. The Afghan shepherd or peasant went to war for much the same mixture of reasons as the more &quot;civilised&quot; European clerk or factory worker - a desire for adventure, a desire not to be left out or lose esteem in the eyes of his fellows, a contempt for invading foreigners, revenge against those that ruined his family life or threatened his faith, perhaps even the chance of extra cash or enhanced personal prospects.

The tribal system is not something particularly backward or warlike. It is simply the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that has an uncomplicated lifestyle - from a materialistic point of view (Heathcote, 2003).

==Education==
''Main article: [[Education in Afghanistan]]''

In the spring of 2003, it was estimated that 30% of Afghanistan's 7,000 schools had been seriously damaged during more than two decades of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation and civil war. Only half of the schools were reported to have clean water, while fewer than an estimated 40% had adequate sanitation. Education for boys was not a priority during the [[Taliban]] regime, and girls were banished from schools outright.

In regards to the poverty and violence of their surroundings, a study in 2002 by the [[Save the Children]] aid group said Afghan children were resilient and courageous. The study credited the strong institutions of family and community.

Up to four million Afghan children, possibly the largest number ever, are believed to have enrolled for class for the school year beginning in March of 2003. Education is available for both girls and boys.

Literacy of the entire population is estimated at 36%, Male Literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. The male literacy rate is higher because previous Taliban laws prohibited the education of women.

Higher Education - The American University of Afghanistan

Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of Higher Education. In 2006 the American University of Afghanistan [http://www.auaf.edu.af] opens it's doors, with support from USAID [http://usinfo.state.gov/sa/Archive/2005/Apr/06-83303.html] and other donors. With the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan, the university will take students from Afghanistan and the region.

''This article is about Albania, the country on the Adriatic coast of the Balkans.  For other historic uses, see [[Albania (disambiguation)]]. 

'''Albania''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Republika e Shqip√´ris√´'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[…æ…õpublika …õ  Éci…ôp…ô…æis…ô]}}) is a [[Mediterranean]] country in southeastern [[Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in the north, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the east, and [[Greece]] in the south; it has a coast on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west, and a coast on the [[Ionian Sea]] in the southwest. The country is an emerging [[democracy]] and is formally named the '''Republic of Albania'''.

== History ==
''Main articles: [[Illyria]], [[Illyricum]], [[Dalmatia]], [[History of Albania]].''

The earlier inhabitants were probably part of the pre-Indo-European populace that occupied the coastline of most parts of the Mediterranean. Their physical remains are scarce though, and concentrated on the coastal region. Soon, these first inhabitants were overrun by the Proto-Hellenic tribes that gradually occupied modern-day Greece, southern parts of what is now the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the south of present-day Albania. This process was completed over the second millennium BC and did not really affect northern or central Albania, an area that at the time presented the image of a political vacuum (in essence a historical paradox).

Historians do not agree over the origin of the [[Illyrians]]. Some of them maintain that the Illyrians descended from the pre-Indo-European [[Pelasgians]], while most scholars place them in the later wave of Indo-European invasions. Their presence can be traced back to 900 BC, when their political structure was formulated in the [[7th century BC|7th]] and [[6th century BC|6th]] centuries BC. Excellent metal craftsmen and fierce warriors, the Illyrians formed warlord based kingdoms that fought amongst themselves for most of their history. Only during the 6th century did the Illyrians venture significant raids against their immediate neighbours: the kingdom of the [[Molossians]] in southern Albania, the kingdom of [[Macedon]], and the kingdom of [[Paionia]].

Besides warfare, the [[Illyrians]] were also peaceful traders of agricultural products and metal works. The [[Illyrian]] culture was heavily influenced by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture (mainly the south Illyrian tribes). Albania is also the site of several ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies.

=== Macedonian Rule ===
Probably their most important success was the slaughter of [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], king of Macedon. Unfortunately for the [[Illyrians]], [[Perdiccas]] was succeeded by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], father of [[Alexander the Great]], who effectively terminated the [[Illyrian]] aggression, effectively ending any dominant control by the [[Illyrians]] in the region.

=== Roman and Byzantine Rule ===
After being conquered by the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was reorganized as a [[Roman]] province, [[Illyricum]], later divided into the provinces of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]], the lands comprising Albania mostly being included in [[Dalmatia]]. Later, the [[Byzantine Empire]] governed the region. It was also ruled by the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian Empire]]. After centuries, use of the name ''Illyria'' to denote the region fell out of fashion.

=== Ottoman Rule ===
In the middle ages, the name ''Albania'' (see ''[[Origin and history of the name Albania]]'') began to be increasingly applied to the region now comprising the nation of Albania. From [[1443]] to [[1468]] [[Skanderbeg|Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu]] led a successful resistance against the invading [[Ottomans]]. After the death of [[Skenderbeg]], resistance continued until [[1478]], although with only moderate success. The loyalties and alliances created and nurtured by [[Skenderbeg]] faltered and fell apart, and the [[Ottomans]] conquered the territory of Albania shortly after the fall of the [[castle]] [[Kruje]]. '''Albania''' then became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Following this, many Albanians fled to neighboring [[Italy]], and the majority of the '''Albanian''' population that remained converted to [[Islam]]. They would remain a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until [[1912]].

=== Effects of the Balkan Wars ===
After the [[Balkan Wars|Second Balkan War]], the [[Ottomans]] were removed from Albania and there was a possibility of the lands being absorbed by [[Serbia]], and the southern tip by [[Greece]]. This decision angered the [[Italians]] who did not want [[Serbia]] to have an extended coastline, and it angered the [[German people|Germans]] who could build a railway to reach the Orient. [[Berlin]] then held discussions with [[Russia]] (the superpower in charge of [[Serbia]]) and with [[Greece]]. Eventually, it was decided that the country should not be divided but instead consolidated into the [[Principality]] of Albania under a German [[prince]],[[William of Wied]]. When the German [[prince]] was expelled by the [[Albanian]] people after 6 months as the self named &quot;King of Albania&quot;, [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], as members the [[League of Nations]], wanted to divide the territory once and for all. Intervention by [[United States of America]] [[president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] vetoed the vote and allowed Albania to retain its status. From [[1928]], the country was ruled by [[Zog of Albania|King Zog I]] until [[1938]] when it became a puppet of [[Italy]].

=== World War II and Enver Hoxha Rule ===
Albanian communists and nationalists actively fought a partisan war against the Italian and German invasions in WW II.  Certain smaller organizations helped the foreign invaders, but it was the [[communists]] who took over after [[World War II]]. In November [[1944]] the communists gained control of the government under the leader of the resistance, [[Enver Hoxha]] . From [[1945]] until [[1990]] Albania had one of the most repressive governments in [[Europe]]. The [[communist party]] was created in [[1941]] with the help of [[Bolshevik]] [[Communist]] Parties. All those who opposed it were eliminated.

For the many decades under his domination, Hoxha created and destroyed relationships with Belgrade, Moscow, and China, always in his personal interests. The country was isolated, first from the West (Western Europe, North America and Australasia) and later even from the communist East.

=== The Fall of Communism and Democratic Albania ===

In 1985, Enver Hoxha died and [[Ramiz Alia]] took his place. Initially, Alia tried to follow in Hoxha's footsteps, but in Eastern Europe changes had already started: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had appeared in the [[Soviet Union]] with new policies ([[Glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]). The Albanian totalitarian regime was under pressure from the [[United States|US]], Europe, and the anger and despair of its own people. After [[Nicolae Ceau≈üescu]] (the communist leader of [[Romania]]) was executed in a revolution, Alia knew he would be next if changes were not made. He signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] (which was signed by other countries in 1975) that respected some [[human rights]]. He also allowed [[pluralism]], and even though his party won the election of 1991 it was clear that the change would not be stopped. In [[1992]] the general elections were won by the Democratic Party with 62% of the votes.

In the general elections of June, [[1996]] the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority and manipulated the results. In [[1997]] an epidemic of [[pyramid schemes]] sent shockwaves through the entire country's economy, and riots started. Police stations and military bases were looted of millions of weaponry, [[Kalashnikov]]s. Anarchy prevailed, and many cities were controlled by militia and less-organized armed citizens. Even US military advisors left the country for their own safety. In response to the anarchy, the Socialist Party won the early elections of [[1997]].

However, stability was far from being restored in the years after the 1997 riots. The power feuds raging inside the Socialist Party led to a series of short-lived Socialist governments. The country was flooded with refugees from neighboring [[Kosovo]] in [[1998]] and [[1999]]. In June, 2002, a compromise candidate, Alfred Moisiu, a former general and defense minister, was elected to succeed President Meidani. Parliamentary elections in July, [[2005]], brought back to power Sali Berisha, Leader of the Democratic Party, mostly owing to Socialist infighting and a series of corruption scandals plaguing the Nano government.

Since 1990 Albania has been diplomatically oriented towards the West, it was accepted to the Council of Europe and has requested membership of [[NATO]]. The work-force of Albania has continued to emigrate to Greece, Italy, Europe and North America. Corruption in the government is becoming more and more obvious. Any hope for a short and not too painful transition after Communism has long since been dashed.

== Politics ==
''Main article:'' [[Politics of Albania]]

The head of state is the president, who is elected by the ''[[Kuvendi]]'', or the Assembly of the Republic of Albania every 5 years. The main part of the Assembly's 140 members is elected every 4 years. 100 of the parliament's members are chosen by the people with a direct vote, while the other 40 members are chosen using a proportional system. The head of government is the Prime Minister who is assisted by a council of ministers.  The Council of Ministers is selected by the Prime Minister (A process called &quot;forming the government&quot;) and then approved by a simple majority (71 votes) in the Assembly.

== Administrative divisions ==
''Main articles: [[Districts of Albania]] and [[Counties of Albania]]''

Albania is divided into 12 ''qark'' (county or prefecture), which are further divided into 36 ''rrethe'' (districts).  The capital city, Tiran√´, has a special status. The districts are:

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Albania]]''

[[Image:Albania map.png|frame|Map of Albania]]

Albania consists of mostly [[hill]]y and [[mountain]]ous terrain, the highest mountain, Korab in the district of Dibra reaching up to 2,753 metres (9,032&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The country mostly has a continental [[climate]], with cold [[winter]]s and hot [[summer]]s.

Besides capital city [[Tirana]], with 800,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durr√´s]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkod√´r]], [[Gjirokast√´r]], [[Vlor√´]] and [[Kor√ß√´]]. In Albanian grammar a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: so both Tiran√´ and Tirana, Shkod√´r and Shkodra are used.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Albania]]''

In Albania, half of the economically-active population still engaged in [[agriculture]] and a fifth works abroad.

The country has almost no exports, and imports most if its goods from Greece and Italy. Money for imports comes from financial aid and from the money that [[immigrant]]s working abroad - mostly in neighbouring Greece - bring to Albania. This is a good [[status quo]] business for both Greece and Italy. 

Albania's coastline on the Ionian Sea, near the Greek tourist island of [[Corfu]], is becoming increasingly popular with foreign visitors due to its relatively unspoilt nature and good beaches. However, the tourist industry is still in its infancy.

Growth was strong 2003-05 and inflation is not a problem.

GDP(purchasing power parity): 18.05 billion
Note: Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP. (2005 est.)

GDP (official exchange rate): 8.741 billion (2005 est.)

GDP (real growth rate): 6% (2005 est.)  

GDP- composition by sector: 
agriculture: 23.6%
industry: 20.5%
services: 55.9%  (2005 est.)

Exports: 708 million f.o.b. (2005 est.)

Imports: 2.473 billion f.o.b. (2005 est.)

Aid per Capita:  52 US$ 

External Debt:  1.41 billion (2003 est.) 

Defence Expenditure:  (n/a)  

Children in Labour Force:  1 % of children aged 10-14 work

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Albania]]''

Most of the population is ethnically Albanian (95% according to the [[CIA World Factbook]] Feb 2005), there is a [[Greece|Greek]] minority (3% of the population), this however could significally vary according to other sources, (note: in 1989, other estimates of the Greek population ranged from 1% (official Albanian statistics) to 12% (from a Greek organization) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/al.html#People]). Many ethnic Albanians also live in the bordering countries of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (around 1,850,000; of that, around 1,800,000 in [[Serbia]] (around 1,700,000 in its province called [[Kosovo]] (officially [[Kosovo and Metohia]]) only) and around 50,000 in [[Montenegro]]) and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (around 500,000) although a lot of Albanians believe that the number might be higher.  Also a small number of ethnic Albanians live in Greece which are called √áam.  Claims over √áam numbers have ranged from 90,000 to over one 1,000,000 but are believed to be understated because Athens has not considered the local Albanians to be a separate ethnic group.[http://www.frosina.org]  Since [[1991]], large numbers of Albanians have emigrated, both legally and illegally, to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]].

The language is [[Albanian language|Albanian]], although [[Greek language|Greek]] is also spoken by the Greek minority in the southern regions of the country.

At the height of the Ottoman occupation, the majority of [[Albanians]] were mostly [[Muslim]] (70%), even though religion was prohibited during the communist era. The Albanian government proclaimed Albania the only officially atheistic country in the world. After the fall of the Communist Regime in 1989-1990 religions were reinstated. According to 1939 statistics, the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox]] (20%) and [[Roman Catholic Church]] (10%) would be the other main religions in Albania. Religious fanaticism has never been a serious problem, with people from different religions living in peace and even getting married although this was not considered to be an optimal solution.  20% of the total Muslim population is [[Bektashi]], people who follow a faith originating in the Turkish migrations into Turkey, and came to Albania through the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]. It has outwardly Shi'ite Islamic elements, but is really a Shamanic-Pantheistic faith.

:''For a king of [[Anglo-Saxon]] England, see [[Aella of Deira]] or [[Aelle II of Northumbria]]  or [[Aelle of Sussex]].''
:''Men's names &lt;u&gt;Allah-ed-din&lt;/u&gt; and similar are misspellings for [[Ala-ud-din]]; and see [[Arabic name#Mistakes made by Europeans and other non-Arabs|here]] for other sorts of error.''
The word '''{{ArabDIN|AllƒÅh}}''' is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for &quot;[[God]]&quot;. In other languages, it is often used to refer specifically to the [[Islamic concept of God]]: see &quot;[[#Usage|Usage]]&quot; below.

==Etymology==
===Usage===
{{Arabicterm|ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá|Allah, AllƒÅh|The God}}
Although, outside the Arab world, use of the word ''AllƒÅh'' is most often associated with [[Islam]], it is not exclusive to that faith; [[Arab Christians]] and various Arabic-speaking [[Jew]]s (including the [[Teimanim]], several {{ArabDIN|[[Mizrahi Jews|Mizra·∏•i]]}} communities and some [[Sephardim]]) also use it to refer to the [[monotheist]] [[deity]]. Arabic translations of the [[Bible]] also employ it, as do [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] in [[Malta]] (who pronounce it as &quot;Alla&quot;), [[Christians]] in [[Indonesia]], who say &quot;Allah Bapa&quot; (God the Father) and Christians in the [[Middle East]] who use the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] &quot;AllƒÅha&quot;.

===&quot;Allah&quot; as a word===
Many [[Linguistics|linguists]] believe that the term ''AllƒÅh'' is derived from a contraction of the Arabic words ''al'' (the) and '' æilƒÅh'' (deity, masculine form) - ''al-ilƒÅh'' meaning &quot;the god.&quot; In addition, one of the main pagan goddesses of pre-Islamic Arabia, [[Allat|AllƒÅt]] (''al'' + '' æilƒÅh'' + ''at'', or 'the goddess'), is cited as being [[Etymology|etymologically]] (though not synchronically) the feminine linguistic counterpart to the grammatically masculine AllƒÅh. If so, the word ''AllƒÅh'' is an abbreviated title, meaning 'the deity', rather than a name. For this reason, both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars often translate AllƒÅh directly into [[English language|English]] as 'God'; this also explains why Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians freely refer to God as AllƒÅh. However, some Muslim scholars feel that &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; should not be translated, because they perceived the Arabic word to express the uniqueness of &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; more accurately than the word &quot;god&quot;, which can take a plural &quot;gods&quot;, whereas the word &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; has no plural form.  This is a significant issue in [[translation of the Qur'an]]. 
[[Image:Allah.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of ''{{ArabDIN|allƒÅh}}'' written in simple [[Arabic calligraphy]].]] 

The word ''AllƒÅh'' is always written without an [[alif]] to spell the ''ƒÅ'' vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using [[alif]] to spell ''ƒÅ''. However, in vocalized spelling, a diacritic ''alif'' is added on top of the ''[[shadda|shaddah]]'' to indicate pronunciation. One exception is in the pre-Islamic [[History of the Arabic alphabet#Pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions|Zabad inscription]], where it is spelled ÿßŸÑÿßŸá.

[[Unicode]] has  glyph reserved for Allah,  {{ar|Ô∑≤}} = U+FDF2, which can be combined with an alif to yield the post-consonantal form, {{ar|ÿßÔ∑≤}}, as opposed to the full spelling ''alif-lƒÅm-lƒÅm-hƒÅ'' {{ar|ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá}} which may be rendered slightly differently, in particular featuring a diacritic ''alif'' on top of the ''shadda''. In this, Unicode imitates traditional Arabic typesetting, which also frequently featured special ''llƒÅh'' types.

Also In ''[[Abjad numerals]]'', [[The Name Of Allah (&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1607;) ]] numeric value is [[66]].

==Islamic use of &quot;AllƒÅh&quot;== 
From the point of view of traditional [[Islam]]ic [[theology]], AllƒÅh is the most precious name of God because it is not a descriptive name like other [[Ninety-nine names of Allah|ninety-nine names of God]], but the name of God's own presence.  Muslims believe that the name of Allah had existed before the time of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]. It is the same God worshipped by [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and other [[prophets of Islam]]. In Islam, there is only one God and Muhammad is the last messenger.  

The emphasis in Islamic culture on reciting the [[Qur'an]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has resulted in ''AllƒÅh'' often being used by [[Muslim]]s world-wide as the word for ''God'', regardless of their [[native language]]. Out of 114 [[Sura]]s in the [[Qur'an]], 113 begin with the [[Basmala]] (&quot;Bismi 'llƒÅhi 'r-rahmƒÅni 'r-rahƒ´m&quot; ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸäŸÖ) which means &quot;In the name of God, the most kind, the most merciful&quot;. 
[[Muslim]]s, when referring to the name, often add the words &quot;Subhanahu wa Ta`ala&quot; after it, meaning &quot;Glorified and Exalted is He&quot; as a sign of reverence, or &quot;`Azza wa Jalla&quot; (ÿπÿ≤ Ÿà ÿ¨ŸÑ). The entire religion of [[Islam]] is based on the idea of getting closer to God. Although commonly referred to as a &quot;He&quot;, God is considered genderless, but there is no [[neuter gender]] to express this in the Arabic language. When Greek or other [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] deities are discussed in Arabic, it is customary to use the expression ''ilƒÅh'', a &quot;deity&quot; or lower-case &quot;god&quot;; sometimes the word ''ma`b≈´d'', literally meaning &quot;worshipped [entity]&quot;, is used instead.

===Uses of &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; in phrases===
There are many [[List of Arabic phrases#Phrases with Allah's name|phrases]] that contain the word AllƒÅh:
*[[Allahu Akbar|AllƒÅhu Akbar]] (ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ£ŸÉÿ®ÿ±) (God is the greatest)
*[[A'uzu billahi minashaitanir rajim]] (I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the damned)
*[[Basmala|Bismi-llƒÅh]] (ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) (In the name of God)
*[[Insha'Allah|InshƒÅ'AllƒÅh]] (ÿ•ŸÜ ÿ¥ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) (God-willing)
:also the origin of the common [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[interjection]] &quot;Ojal√°&quot;, which shares a similar meaning.
:probably also the origin of the [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] interjection ''Oxal√°'', &quot;let's hope for it&quot; or &quot;let's hope that...&quot;.
*[[YƒÅ AllƒÅh]] (Ÿäÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá)(Oh God)
:may be the origin of the Spanish and Portuguese [[exclamation]] &quot;Ol√©!&quot;.
*[[Masha Allah|MƒÅ shƒÅ' AllƒÅh]] (ŸÖÿß ÿ¥ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) ([Look at] what God has willed!)
*[[Subhan'allah|SubhƒÅn AllƒÅh]] (ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) (Glory be to God)
*[[alhamdulillah|al-Hamdu li-llƒÅh]] (ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÑŸÑŸá) (All praise be to God)
*[[AllƒÅhu A`alam]] (ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ£ÿπŸÑŸÖ) (God knows best)
*[[Jazaka AllƒÅhu khayran]] (ÿ¨ÿ≤ÿßŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿÆŸäÿ±ÿßŸã) (May God reward you for your deeds)

&quot;AllƒÅh&quot; appears in a stylized form on the [[flag of Iran]], in the phrase &quot;AllƒÅhu Akbar&quot; on the [[flag of Iraq]], and as part of the [[shahadah|shahƒÅdah]] on the [[flag of Saudi Arabia]].

&quot;Allah&quot; is not correctly used as a man's name. See [[Arabic name#Mistakes made by Europeans and other non-Arabs]].

==Islamic concept of God==
{{main|Islamic concept of God}} 

The Islamic concept of mankind's place in the universe hinges on the notion that '''[[AllƒÅh]]''', or '''[[God]]''', is the only true [[reality]]. There is nothing permanent other than Him. God is considered eternal and &quot;uncreated&quot;, whereas everything else in the universe is &quot;created.&quot; The Qur'an describes Him in [[Sura 112]]: &quot;Say: He is AllƒÅh, [[Singular]]. AllƒÅh, the Absolute. He begetteth not nor was begotten. And to Him have never been one equal.&quot; (see [[Tawhid]] for more). The Qur'an condemns and mocks the pre-Islamic Arabs for attributing daughters to AllƒÅh ([[sura 53]]:19.)

Muslims believe that AllƒÅh, or [[God]], is the only true God who deserves to be worshipped. This belief must be accompanied by the acknowledgement that Mohammad was a true prophet of God who was chosen to guide people to believing and worshipping God in the correct manner. God is considered eternal and uncreated; with no beginning, whereas everything else in the universe is created with a beginning. The Qur'an mentions, (approximated in English)  [[Sura 112]]: &quot;Say: He is AllƒÅh, Without partner. AllƒÅh, the Absolute. He begetteth not nor was begotten. And to Him have never been one equal.&quot; (see [[Tawhid]] for more). 

God is considered by Muslims to be [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]], and [[Omniscience|omniscient]]. In the Qur'an, God is described as being fully aware of everything that happens in the universe, and knows all things. God also knows what is in people's hearts and minds at all times. It is mentioned in the Qur'an (approximately), &quot;And He it is Who takes your souls at night (in sleep), and He knows what you acquire in the day, then He raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you were doing. ([[sura 6]]:60)&quot; 

Placing  God inside his creation, or suggesting that nature or creation simultaneously co-exist in God or vice versa, as in other religious traditions, completely compromises exclusive Islamic monotheism. Attributing a partner, spouse, father, son, daughter, mother or other relation(s) to Allah, literally or metaphorically, partially or completely, is considered unquestionably blasphemous by Muslims.

Therefore, Muslims consider it blasphemous to describe Jesus (or another man, woman child etc) as 'Son of God' whether literally or metaphorically. Similarly, Muslims do not believe that God resembles a man (old or young), woman, half man half woman, half man half animal , bird, elephant or other animal or other creation. It is forbidden for Muslims to view God [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphically]].

Allah does not resemble any of his creations in any way whatsoever. Allah is not attributed with shape, colour, size, position, location, direction and indeed all of these attributes are found in the creatures Allah created.

Further, Muslims do not believe that Allah is located in a place, whether on Earth, below the Earth, in the Sky, above the Sky, on a Throne above the Sky or all of these places at once or anywhere else or everywhere, but rather, God exists without a place (given he created all places and locations) and the perfectness of his existence is not compromised by his existence not being bound to a created (by Allah) place or location.

God is attributed with complete perfection in his attributes and is free from any defects or any imperfections. Allah is attributed (amongst other attributes) with oneness (without a partner in God's self or attributes), non-beginningness, eternalness, complete freedom from needing others (i.e. each or any of his creations), complete power to do all things, Will (to do as he wills, as and when God decides without any obstruction), knowledge, (of all things simultaneously, past, present and future) hearing (of all sounds without needing any implement or organ to hear), sight (without needing eyes or any other organ or instrument nor light rays to illuminate an area or an object), life (unlike the human or other life which is created and limited, but that which befits him with no beginning or end), speech (unlike the human, created speech which is constituted of languages, letters and sounds but rather an eternal speech which is not a creation but an attribute of God) and the complete non-resemblence of any creation in his self or attributes.

==History==
It was used in pre-Islamic times by Pagans within the Arabian peninsula to signify the supreme creator. Pre-Islamic  Jews referred to their supreme creator as [[Yahweh]] or [[Elohim]].  The pagan Arabs recognized &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; as the supreme God in their [[Pre-Islamic mythology|pantheon]]; along with Allah, however, the pre-Islamic Arabs believed in a host of other gods, such as [[Hubal]] and 'daughters of AllƒÅh' (the three daughters associated were [[Al-lat|al-LƒÅt]], [[Al-Uzza|al-`Uzzah]], and [[Manah]]) (Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, ''&quot;The Facts on File&quot;'', ed. Anthony Mercatante, [[New York]], [[1983]], I:61). This view of Allah by the pre-Islamic pagans is viewed by Muslims as a latter development having arisen as a result of moving away from Abrahamic monotheism over time. Some of the names of these pagan gods are said to be derived from the descendants of Noah, whom latter generations firstly revered as saints, and then transformed into gods (although non-Muslims often view polytheism as having come before monotheism). The pagan Arabians also used the word &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; in the names of their children; [[Muhammad]]'s father, who was born into pagan society, was named &quot;`AbdullƒÅh&quot;, which translates &quot;servant of AllƒÅh&quot;. &quot;`AbdullƒÅh&quot; is still used for names of Muslim and non-Muslim arabs.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for deity, [[Names of God in Judaism#El|El]] (◊ê◊ú) or [[Names of God in Judaism#Elohim|El≈çah]] (◊ê◊ú◊ï◊î), was used as an [[Old Testament]] synonym for [[Yahweh]] (◊ô◊î◊ï◊î), which is the proper name for the Jewish God according to the [[Tanakh]]. The [[Aramaic]] word for God is ''al√¥h-√¥'' ([[Syriac]] dialect) or el√¢h√¢ (Biblical dialect), which comes from the same Proto-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word (''* æil√¢h-'') as the Arabic and Hebrew terms; [[Jesus]] is described in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:34 as having used the word on the cross, with the ending meaning &quot;my&quot;, when saying, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; (transliterated in Greek as ''el≈ç-i'').  One of the earliest surviving translations of the word into a foreign language is in a [[Greek language|Greek]] translation of the [[Shahada]], from 86-96 AH ([[705]]-[[715]] AD), which translates it as ''ho theos monos''[http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Papyri/enlp1.html], literally &quot;the one god&quot;. Also the cognate Aramaic term appears in the Aramaic version of the ''New Testament'', called the [[Pshitta]] (or Peshitta) as one of the words Jesus used to refer to God, e.g., in the sixth Beatitude, &quot;Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see AlƒÅha.&quot; And in the Arabic Bible the same words ([[Matthew 5:8|Mt 5:8]]): &quot;ÿ∑ŸèŸàÿ®ŸéŸâ ŸÑÿ£ŸéŸÜŸíŸÇŸêŸäŸéÿßÿ°Ÿê ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿêÿå ŸÅŸéÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸëŸáŸèŸÖŸí ÿ≥ŸéŸäŸéÿ±ŸéŸàŸíŸÜŸé ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá&quot;

==Other beliefs==
[[The Nation of Gods and Earths]], one of the many sects created as the result of black separatist movements in the United States, holds that the word &quot;AllƒÅh&quot; is the name of the original black man and stands for &quot;Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head&quot;. [http://web.archive.org/web/20041019023127/http://www.ibiblio.org/nge/] [http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2002-10-29-oped-goldblatt_x.htm] This concept is alien to mainstream Islam, which strictly opposes any attempt to portray AllƒÅh as a human or in any other way. Mainstream Islam also prohibits attibuting divine qualities to, worshipping, or glorifying anything other than AllƒÅh.

The [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith]], whose [[:Category:Bah√°'√≠ texts|scriptures]] are primarily written in [[Arabic]] and [[Farsi]], also uses '''Allah''' to mean God, though in practice the customary word for God in the local language is typically used when speaking in that language.  Some particular uses are not translated, but the Arabic phrase is used.  The chief example of this would be the Bah√°'√≠ customary greeting '''All√°h'u'abh√°''' which is commonly translated as ''God is the All Glorious''.

'''Antarctica''' ([[Greek language|Greek]], ''antarktikos'': &quot;opposite the [[Arctic]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon '' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=%239514 &quot;antarktikos&quot;]. Retrieved February 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[continent]] encircling the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[South Pole]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]] and divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

[[Image:Shackleton expedition.jpg|left|thumb|210px|''The Endurance'' at night during [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1914.]]
In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''‚Äîa vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa‚Äîhad existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

Bransfield supposedly saw Antarctica on [[January 27]], [[1820]], three days before Palmer sighted land. It is certain that on [[January 28]], [[1820]] the expedition led by [[Fabian von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] on two ships reached a point within 32&amp;nbsp;km (20&amp;nbsp;miles) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there.

He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Antarctic researchers.jpg|thumb|Two American researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]
Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Ad√©lie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was &quot;[[Operaci√≥n 90]]&quot;, undertaken 10 years before the Antarctic Treaty by the [[Military of Argentina|Argentinian military]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica Institute of Argentina.

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 reported landing 112,934 metric tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santa Barbara City College Biological Sciences [http://www.biosbcc.net/ocean/AAimportance.htm Importance of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world but the Antarctic. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than a thousand scientists, visitors, and tourists. 

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic Connection [http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml Science in Antarctica] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

{{wiktionarypar|Argentina}}

The '''Argentine Republic''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Rep√∫blica Argentina'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[reÀàpuŒ≤lika a…æx…õnÀàtina]}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]], situated between the [[Andes]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[British overseas territory|British overseas territories]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. Under the name of [[Argentine Antarctica]], it claims around 1,000,000 [[square kilometre]]s (386,000&amp;nbsp;[[square miles|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) of [[Antarctica]], overlapping other claims by [[Chile]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. By area, it is the second largest country of South America after Brazil and the 8th largest country in the [[world]].

The country is formally named ''Rep√∫blica Argentina'' {{audio|1=es-Argentina.ogg|2=(pronunciation)}} (Argentine Republic), while for purposes of [[Law of Argentina|legislation]] the form ''Naci√≥n Argentina'' (Argentine Nation) is used.

==Origin and history of the name==
{{main|Origin and history of the name of Argentina}}

The name '''Argentina''' derives from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]). The first [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s called the River Plate the [[R√≠o de la Plata]] (&quot;River of Silver&quot;). Indigenous people gave silver gifts to the survivors of the shipwrecked expedition, who were led by [[Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s]]. The legend of [[Sierra del Plata]] &amp;mdash; a mountain rich in silver &amp;mdash; reached Spain around [[1524]]. The name Argentina was first used in Ruy D√≠az de Guzm√°n's 1612 book ''Historia del descubrimiento, poblaci√≥n, y conquista del R√≠o de la Plata'' (History of the discovery, population, and conquest of the R√≠o de la Plata), naming the territory ''Tierra Argentina'' (Land of Silver).

==History==
{{main|History of Argentina}}

The area of present Argentina was sparsely populated until it was colonised by [[european|Europeans]]. The native people known as [[Diaguita]] lived in northwestern Argentina on the edge of the expanding [[Inca Empire]]; the [[Guaran√≠]] lived farther east.

Europeans arrived in [[1502]]. [[Spain]] established a permanent colony on the site of [[Buenos Aires]] in [[1580]], and the [[Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata]] in [[1776]]. Independence from Spain was declared on [[July 9]] [[1816]]. Centralist and federationist groups were in conflict, until national unity was established and the [[Argentine constitution|constitution]] promulgated in [[1853]].

Foreign [[investment]] and [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]] from Europe aided the introduction of modern agricultural techniques and integration of Argentina into the world economy in the late 19th century. In the 1880s the &quot;[[Conquest of the Desert]]&quot; subdued or exterminated the remaining native tribes throughout [[Patagonia]].

From [[1880]] to [[1930]] Argentina became one of the ten wealthiest nations. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until [[1916]], when their traditional rivals, the [[Radical Civic Union|Radicals]], won control of the government. The military forced [[Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen]] from power in 1930 leading to another decade of Conservative rule.

Political change led to the presidency of [[Juan Per√≥n]] in [[1946]], who aimed at empowering the working class and greatly expanded the number of unionised workers. The [[Revoluci√≥n Libertadora]] of [[1955]] deposed him.

In the 1950s and 1960s, military and civilian administrations traded power. When military governments failed to revive the economy and suppress escalating [[terrorism]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the way was open for Per√≥n's return to the presidency in 1973, with his third wife, [[Isabel Per√≥n|Mar√≠a Estela Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n]], as Vice President. During this period, extremists on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]] carried out [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts with a frequency that threatened public order.

[[Image:Buenos Aires-2672f-Banco de la Naci√≥n Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank of the Argentine Nation, Buenos Aires]]

Per√≥n died in [[1974]]. His wife succeeded him in office, but a military coup removed her from office in [[1976]], and the armed forces formally exercised power through a [[junta]] in charge of the self-appointed [[Proceso de Reorganizaci√≥n Nacional|National Reorganisation Process]], until [[1983]]. The armed forces repressed opposition using harsh illegal measures (the &quot;[[Dirty War]]&quot;); thousands of dissidents were &quot;[[desaparecidos|disappeared]]&quot;, while the [[SIDE]] cooperated with the [[CIA]], [[DINA]] and other South American intelligence agencies in [[Operation Condor]]. Many of the military leaders that took part in the Dirty War were trained in the U.S. financed [[School of the Americas]]. Among them Argentine dictators [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] and [[Roberto Viola]].

Economic problems, charges of corruption, public revulsion in the face of [[human rights]] abuses and, finally, the country's [[1982]] defeat in the [[Falklands War]] discredited the Argentine military regime. 

Democracy was restored in [[1983]]. [[Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n]]'s Radical government took steps intending to account for the &quot;disappeared&quot;, establishing civilian control of the armed forces and consolidating democratic institutions. Failure to resolve endemic economic problems and an inability to maintain public confidence caused his early departure.

President [[Carlos Menem]] imposed [[Argentine peso|peso]]-[[US dollar|dollar]] [[fixed exchange rate]] in [[1991]] to stop [[hyperinflation]], and adopted far-reaching market-based policies, dismantling [[protectionism|protectionist]] barriers and business [[deregulation|regulations]], and implementing a privatisation program. These reforms contributed to significant increases in investment and growth with stable prices through most of the 1990s.

The Menem and [[Fernando de la R√∫a|de la R√∫a]] administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports, massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment, chronic fiscal and trade deficits, and the contagion of several economic crises. The [[Asian financial crisis]] in [[1998]] precipitated an outflow of capital that mushroomed into a [[recession]], which led to a total freezing of the [[bank account]]s (the ''[[corralito]]''), and culminated in a financial panic in November 2001. The next month, amidst [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|bloody riots]], President de la R√∫a resigned.

Several new presidents followed in quick succession. Argentina [[default (finance)|default]]ed on its international debt obligations. The peso's almost 12-year-old link with the dollar was abandoned, resulting in massive [[devaluation|currency depreciation]] and [[inflation]], in turn triggering a spike in unemployment and poverty. In [[2003]], [[N√©stor Kirchner]] became the president, and started implementing new policies based on re-industrialisation, [[import substitution]], increased exports, consistent fiscal surplus, and high exchange rate.

==Politics==
[[Image:Buenos Aires Congreso stock xchng 214239.jpg|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Politics of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Law of Argentina}}

The [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine constitution]] of 1853, as [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|revised in 1994]], mandates a [[Separation of powers|separation of powers]] into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial branch]]es at the national and provincial level. The [[president of Argentina|president]] and vice-president are directly elected to 4-year terms. Both are limited to two consecutive terms; they are allowed to stand for a third term or more after an interval of at least one term. The president appoints [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] ministers, and the constitution grants him considerable power as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], including authority to enact laws by presidential decree under conditions of &quot;urgency and necessity&quot; and the [[line-item veto]].

Argentina's [[parliament]] is the bicameral [[National Congress]] or ''[[Argentine National Congress|Congreso de la Naci√≥n]]'', consisting of a [[Senate]] (''[[Argentine Senate|Senado]]'') of 72 seats and a [[Chamber of Deputies]] (''[[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|C√°mara de Diputados]]'') of 257 members. Since 2001, senators have been directly elected, with each province, including the [[Federal Capital]], represented by three senators. Senators serve 6-year terms. One-third of the Senate stands for reelection every 2 years via a partial majority system in each district. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are directly elected to 4-year term via a system of [[proportional representation]]. Voters elect half the members of the [[lower house]] every 2 years.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Military of Argentina}}

Argentina is currently prompting the [[Mercosur]] as its first external priority, contrasting with the 1990s' emphasis in the relationship with the [[United States]].

==Administrative divisions==
[[Image:Argentina provinces.png|framed|Provinces of Argentina. Argentine Antarctica and Southern Atlantic Islands (23) not shown.]]
{{main|Provinces of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Governors in Argentina}}

Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 [[autonomous city]] (commonly known as ''capital federal''), marked with an asterisk:

&lt;/ol&gt;
|}
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; The current official name for the [[federal district]] is &quot;Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires&quot;.

Buenos Aires has been the capital of Argentina since its unification, but there have been projects to move the administrative centre elsewhere. During the presidency of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n a law was passed ordering the move of the federal capital to [[Viedma]], a city in the Patagonic province of R√≠o Negro. Studies were underway when hyperinflation, in 1989, killed off the project. Though the law was never formally repealed, it has become a mere historical relic, and the project has been forgotten.

===Urbanization===
{{main|List of cities in Argentina}}
[[Image:Tucuman_govthouse.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Government house of Tucum√°n]]
About 2.7 million people live in the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]], and roughly 11.5 million in [[Gran Buenos Aires|Greater Buenos Aires]] (2001), making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world. Together with their respective [[metropolitan area]]s, the second and third largest cities in Argentina, [[C√≥rdoba, Argentina|C√≥rdoba]] and [[Rosario]], comprise about 1.3 and 1.1 million inhabitants, respectively.

Most European [[immigration in Argentina|immigrants to Argentina]] (coming in great waves especially around the World War I and II) settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the [[middle class]]. Since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.

The 1990s saw many rural towns become [[ghost town]]s when train services were abandoned and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of imported cheap goods, in part because of the monetary policy which kept the U.S. dollar exchange rate fixed and low. Many slums (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities, inhabited by empoverished low-class urban dwellers and migrants from smaller towns in the interior of the country. However, it is important to note that the majority of the people that live in these newly formed small shanty towns are people that came from neighboring countries during the time of convertibility and never left. This immigration of humble people from a low socioeconomic status represented an undesirable change because shanty towns and homeless people begging for money was something Argentines didn't know until the economic disaster of the 1990s. However, the government works actively to try to include these new inmigrants into Argentine society and considers their children born in Argentina to be Argentines. There are no plans to build any type of wall to keep these inmigrants out. Argentina adheres to a policy of allowing anybody who wants to come to Argentina to come freely without restrictive inmigration measures. In this respect Argentina is more progressive than many fully developed countries. 

&lt;!-- to be filled in with middle class home data --&gt;
Argentina's urban areas have a European look, reflecting the influence of their European settlers. Many towns and cities are built like Spanish cities around a main square called a plaza. A cathedral and important government buildings often face the plaza. The general layout of the cities is called a ''damero'', that is, a checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks, though modern developments sometimes depart from it (for example, the city of La Plata, built at the end of the 19th century, is organised as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals).

In descending order by number of inhabitants, the major cities in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[C√≥rdoba, Argentina|C√≥rdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucum√°n]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bah√≠a Blanca]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Ar-map.png|200px|thumb|Map of Argentina]]
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}

Argentina can roughly be divided into three parts: the fertile plains of the [[Pampa]]s in the central part of the country, the centre of Argentina's [[agriculture|agricultural]] wealth; the flat to rolling plateau of [[Patagonia]] in the southern half down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the rugged [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point being the [[Cerro Aconcagua]] at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

Major rivers include the [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paran√° River|Paran√°]]. The latter two flow together before meeting the [[Atlantic Ocean]], forming the estuary of the [[R√≠o de la Plata]]. The Argentine [[climate]] is predominantly [[temperate climate|temperate]] with extremes ranging from [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] in the north to arid/sub-Antarctic in far south.

=== Enclaves and exclaves ===
There is one Argentine [[exclave]]: the island of [[Mart√≠n Garc√≠a]] (co-ordinates {{coor dm|34|11|S|58|15|W}}). It is situated near the confluence of the Paran√° and Uruguay rivers, a mere kilometre (0.62&amp;nbsp;mi) inside [[Uruguay]]an waters, about 3.5 kilometres (2.1 mi) from the Uruguayan coastline, near the small city of [[Mart√≠n Chico]] (itself about halfway between [[Nueva Palmira]] and [[Colonia del Sacramento]]).

An agreement reached by Argentina and Uruguay in 1973 reaffirmed Argentine jurisdiction over the island, ending a century-old dispute between the two countries. According to the terms of the agreement, Mart√≠n Garc√≠a is to be devoted exclusively to a natural preserve. Its area is about 2 square kilometres (500&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s), and the population about 200 people.

==Economy==
[[Image:Buenos Aires Monserrat.jpg|thumb|250px|Subway station in Monserrat, Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Economy of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Tourism in Argentina}}

Argentina benefits from rich [[natural resource]]s, a highly [[literate]] population, an export-oriented [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, and a diversified [[industry|industrial]] base. The country historically had a large middle class, compared to other Latin American countries, but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises. Today, while a significant segment of the population is still financially well-off, they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it.

Since the late 1970s the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high [[inflation]]. In 1991, the government [[fixed exchange rate|pegged]] the peso to the [[United States dollar|U. S. dollar]] and limited the growth in the [[monetary base]]. The government then embarked on a path of [[free trade|trade liberalisation]], [[deregulation]], and [[privatisation]]. Inflation dropped and [[gross domestic product|GDP]] grew, but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits, causing it to crumble in slow motion, from 1995 and up to the [[Argentine economic crisis|collapse in 2001]].

By 2002 Argentina had [[default (finance)|default]]ed on its debt, its GDP had shrunk, [[unemployment]] was over 25%, the peso had [[devaluation|devalued]] 75% after being [[floating exchange rate|floated]], and inflation was hitting again. However, careful spending control and heavy [[tax]]es on now soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct [[monetary policy]].

In 2003, [[import substitution]] policies and soaring [[export]]s, coupled with a lower inflation and expansive economic measures, triggered a surge in the GDP, which was repeated in 2004, creating jobs and encouraging internal consumption. [[Capital flight]] decreased, and [[foreign investment]] slowly returned. The influx of foreign currency from exports created such a huge [[trade surplus]] that the Central Bank was forced to buy dollars from the market, which it continues to do at the time, to be accumulated as [[reserve currency|reserves]].

The situation in 2005 is much improved, but there are still large numbers of unemployed people that beg for some money or food, especially in the outskirts of [[Buenos Aires]]. Some of them are homeless, and there is at least one small non-profit humanitarian organisation which distributes free food to some of them most days of the week. However, the country is still the most developed country in Latin America. It boasts the highest GDP per capita, the highest levels of education measured by university attendance, and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects is equal in quality to that found in fully industrialized nations. In 2002 over 57% of the population was below the poverty line, at the end of 2005 it was 34%. In 2002 unemployement had reached over 25%, and now it is 10%. GDP per capita has surpassed the previous pre-recession peek of 1998. It is a very interesting time in Argentina because the experts agree that if the country makes the right decisions it could develop and reclaim its previosly held position in the first world. So far things are looking good; the economy grew 8.8% in 2003, 9.0% in 2004, and 9.1% in 2005. The floor is set so that the economy will grow between 6.0% and 7.5% in 2006 and the government is paying down the foreign debt; foreign debt now stands at 69% of GDP and is slowly decreasing. The Argentine economy has so much untapped potential that if the country manages to encourage the proper level of investment the country could experience growth rates of 9.0% for this year and years to come.

==Demographics==
[[Image:TeatroColon.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Night shot of the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
{{main|Demographics of Argentina}}

Unlike most of its neighbouring countries, Argentina's population descends overwhelmingly from [[Europe|Europeans]]. The basic demographic stock (97% of the population) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ar.html] is made up of descendants of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other [[Europe|European]] settlers. 

Waves of immigrants from [[Europe]]an countries arrived in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]]. The Patagonian [[Chubut Valley]] has a significant [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh-descended population]] and retains many aspects of [[Wales|Welsh]] culture. Other important immigrant groups came from [[Germany]] ([[Germany|German]] colonies were settled in the provinces of Entre R√≠os, Misiones, Formosa, C√≥rdoba and the Patagonian region, as well as in Buenos Aires itself), [[France]] (mostly settled in Buenos Aires city and province), [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]), the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] (Buenos Aires and Patagonia), and [[Eastern Europe]]an nations, such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[Balkans]] region (especially [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]) and others. The overwhelming majority of Argentina's [[Jew|Jewish]] community, numbering about 395,379  [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html], also derives from immigrants of Northern and Eastern European origin &amp;mdash; [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. It is the largest Jewish community in [[Latin America]] and fifth largest in the world.

[[Middle East]]ern immigrants number about 500,000, mainly in urban areas.{{Citation needed}}

Small numbers of people from [[Far East]] [[Asia]] have also settled Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires. The first [[Asian-Argentines]] were of [[Japan]]ese descent, but [[Korea]]ns, [[Vietnam]]ese, and [[China|Chinese]] soon followed. There are also smaller numbers of people from the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==Culture==
[[Image:Buenos_Aires-Center-P3050007.JPG|thumb|European and modern styles in Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Culture of Argentina}}
{{seealso|List of Argentines}}
Argentine culture has been primarily informed and influenced by its European roots. Buenos Aires is undeniably the most European city in [[South America]], due both to the prevalence of people of Italian, Spanish and German descent and to conscious imitation.

Argentine cinema has achieved international recognition with films such as &quot;[[The Official Story]]&quot; and &quot;[[Nine Queens]]&quot;, though it has only rarely been taken into account by mainstream popular viewers who prefer Hollywood-type movies. Even low-budget productions, however, have obtained prizes in cinema festivals (such as [[Cannes]]). The city of [[Mar del Plata]] organizes its own festival dedicated to this art.

The best-known element of Argentine culture is probably their music and dance, particularly [[tango (dance)|tango]]. In modern Argentina, tango music is enjoyed in its own right, especially since the radical [[Astor Piazzolla]] redefined the music of [[Carlos Gardel]]. It must be noted that while tango refers mostly to a particular dancing music for foreigners, the music together with the lyrics (often sung in a kind of slang called [[lunfardo]]) are what most Argentines primarily mean by tango. Tango lyrics can be considered a kind of poetry. 
Since the 1970s rock and roll is also widely appreciated in Argentina. First during the 1970s and then again at the mid 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, national rock and roll and pop music experienced bursts of popularity, with many new bands (such as [[Soda Stereo]] and Sumo) and composers (like [[Charly Garc√≠a]] and [[Fito P√°ez]]) becoming important referents of national culture.
[[Buenos Aires]] is also considered the [[techno]]/[[electronica]] country in Latin America, that started with little raves, and nowadays is home of important events such as [[Creamfields]] (which has the world record of 65,000 people), South American Music Conference and many more.

[[European classical music]] is well-considered in Argentina, with the [[Col√≥n Theater]] one of the best opera houses in the world. Musicians such as [[Martha Argerich]] and composers like [[Lalo Schifrin]] have become internationally famous.

===Language===
{{main|List of Native American languages in Argentina}}
{{seealso|Welsh settlement in Argentina}}
[[Image:Buenos Aires-Puente de la Mujer.jpg|thumb|250px|Women's Bridge in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires]]
The only official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although some immigrants and indigenous communities have retained their [[List of Native American languages in Argentina|original languages]] in specific points of the country. There are, for example many [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking towns in Patagonia and [[German language|German]]-speaking cities in C√≥rdoba, Buenos Aires and cities in the Patagonia. Italian and French is also widely spoken.

Argentina is the largest [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking community in the world that employs ''[[voseo]]'' (the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''t√∫'', associated with some alternate verb conjugations). The most prevalent dialect is [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]], with most speakers located in the basin of the [[R√≠o de la Plata]].

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Argentina}}
Argentina is an overwhelmingly [[Christian]] country. The majority of Argentina's population (80%) is at least nominally [[Roman Catholic]]. Roman Catholicism is supported by the state, as stipulated in the Constitution. Evangelical churches gained a place in Argentina especially since the 1980s and now number more than 3.5 million or 10%. Members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]) number over 330,300, the seventh largest concentration in the world[http://www.lds.org.ar/noticias2005/noti_ene2005/info_noti_ene2005_05.htm]. Traditional [[Protestant]] communities are also present.

The country also hosts the largest [[Judaism|Jewish]] population in [[Latin America]], about 395,379 strong. It is also home to one of the largest [[mosque]]s in Latin America, serving Argentina's small [[Islam|Muslim]] community.

The '''Republic of Armenia''', or '''Armenia''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{Hayeren|’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂}}, ''Hayastan'', {{Hayeren|’Ä’°’µ÷Ñ}}, ''Hayq''), is a [[landlocked]] [[Eurasian]] country in the [[Caucasus]] region, bordered by [[Turkey]] to the west, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the north, [[Azerbaijan]] to the east, and [[Iran]] and the [[Nakhichevan]] [[exclave]] of Azerbaijan to the south. Armenia is a member of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and for centuries has been on the crossroads between the east and west.

== Origin of the name ==
The original [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name for the country was ''Hayq'', later ''Hayastan'', translated as ''the land of Haik'', and consisting of the name Haik and the [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix '[[-stan]]' (land). According to legend, [[Haik]] was a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]] (son of [[Togarmah]], who was a son of [[Gomer]], a son of Noah's son, [[Japheth]]), and according to an ancient Armenian tradition, a forefather of all [[Armenian people|Armenians]]. He is said to have settled below [[Mount Ararat]], travelled to assist in building the [[Tower of Babel]], and, after his return, defeated the [[Babylon|Babylonian]] king Bel (believed by some researchers to be [[Nimrod]]) on [[August 11]], [[25th century BC|2492 BC]] near [[Lake Van]], in the southern part of historic Armenia (presently in [[Turkey]]).

Hayq was given the name Armenia by the surrounding states, as it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian lands, who called themselves ''Armens''. It is traditionally derived from ''Armenak'' or ''Aram'' (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all Armenians). Some Jewish and Christian scholars write that the name 'Armenia' was derived from ''Har-Minni'', that is 'Mountains of Minni' (or [[Mannai]]). Pre-Christian accounts suggest that ''Nairi'', meaning ''land of rivers'', was an ancient name for the country's mountainous region, first used by [[Assyrians]] around [[1200 BC]]; while the first recorded inscription bearing the name Armenia, namely the [[Behistun Inscription]] in [[Iran]], dates from [[521 BC]].

== History ==
{{History of Armenia}}
{{main|History of Armenia}}

Armenia has been populated by humans since prehistoric times, and has been proposed as the site of the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]].

Armenia was a regional empire with a rich culture in the years leading up to the [[1st century]], spanning from the shores of the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the rule of [[Tigranes the Great]]. 

Armenia's strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples, including the [[Assyrians]], [[Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantines]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]].

In [[Anno Domini|AD]] [[301]], Armenia became the first country in the world to adopt [[Christianity]] as its official [[state religion]], twelve years before the Roman Empire granted Christianity official toleration under [[Galerius]], and some 30-40 years before Constantine was baptised.  There had been various [[paganism|pagan]] communities  before Christianity, but they were converted by an influx of Christian missionaries.  

Having changed between various dynasties -- including [[Parthian]] (Iranian), [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Byzantine]], [[Arab]], [[Mongol]] and [[Iran|Persian]] occupations -- Armenia was substantially weakened. In 1500's, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid]] Persia divided Armenia among themselves.

In 1813 and 1828, present-day Armenia (consisting of the [[Erivan]] and [[Karabakh]] [[khanate]]s within Persia) was temporarily incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]. After a short-lived independent republic established after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Petrograd]], Armenia was incorporated into the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. Between 1922 and 1936 it existed as the [[Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] (with Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan), and from 1936 to 1991 as the [[Armenian SSR]].

During the final years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] ([[1915]]-[[1922]]), a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished as a result of what is termed the [[Armenian Genocide]], regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings. Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were a result of a [[civil war]] coupled with disease and [[famine]], with casualties incurred by both sides. Most estimates for the number of Armenians killed range from [[Ottoman Armenian casualties|650,000 to 1,500,000]], and these events are traditionally commemorated yearly on [[April 24]]. Armenians and a handful of other countries worldwide have been campaigning for official recognition of the events as genocide for over 30 years, but there are also many countries who are pressured not to officially characterize the Armenian massacres as genocide.

Armenia remained preoccupied by a long conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a mostly Armenian-populated [[enclave]] that, Armenians allege, [[Stalin]] had placed in Soviet Azerbaijan. A military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan began in 1988, and the fighting escalated after both countries gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a [[cease-fire]] took hold, &lt;!--ethnic WERE THEY ETHNIC OR ARMENIAN REPUBLIC FORCES&gt;/!--&gt;Armenian forces controlled not only [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] but also the surrounding districts of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a peaceful resolution.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Armenia}}
The Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style [[parliamentary democracy]] as the basis of its [[form of government]]. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referenda since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the [[Electoral Commission|electoral commission]], and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. For the most part however, Armenia is considered one of the more pro-democratic nations in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

The [[unicameral parliament]] (also called the National Assembly) is controlled by a coalition of three political parties: the conservative Republican party [http://www.hhk.am], the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], and the [[Country of Law]] party. The main opposition is composed of several smaller parties joined in the [[Justice Bloc]].

Armenians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a September 1991 referendum. [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]] was president until January 1998, when public demonstrations against his increasingly authoritarian regime and his domestic and foreign policies forced his resignation. In 1999, as the Prime Minister [[Vasgen Sarkissian|Vazgen Sargsian]], parliament Speaker [[Karen Demirchyan|Karen Demirchian]], and six other officials were killed in the attack on the National Assembly [http://www.aaainc.org/ArTW/article.php?articleID=468], the country experienced a period of political instability. President [[Robert Kocharian]] was successful in riding out the unrest, and currently rules with the support of the parliamentary coalition.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Armenia map.png|thumb|Map of Armenia]]
{{main|Geography of Armenia}}
Armenia is a [[landlocked]] country in the [[Transcaucasus|southern Caucasus]].  Located between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s, Armenia is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].  Though geographically in Western Asia, politically and culturally Armenia is closely aligned with Europe. Historically, Armenia has been at the crossroads between Europe and Southwest Asia, and is therefore seen as a transcontinental nation.

The Republic of Armenia, covering an area of 30,000 [[square kilometre]]s (11,600&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]), is located in the north-east of the [[Armenian Highland]] (covering 400,000 sq km or 154,000&amp;nbsp;sq.&amp;nbsp;mi), otherwise known as historic Armenia and considered as the original homeland of [[Armenians]].

The terrain is mostly [[mountain|mountainous]], with fast flowing [[rivers]] and few [[forests]]. The climate is highland [[Continental climate|continental]]: hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to 4,095 [[metre]]s (13,435&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) [[above sea-level]] at [[Mount Aragats]], and no point is below 400 metres (1,312&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. [[Ararat|Mount Ararat]], regarded by the Armenians as a [[symbol]] of their land, is the highest mountain in the region and used to be part of Armenia until around 1915, when it fell to the Turks.

Armenia is trying to address its [[environment|environmental]] problems.  It has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities.  Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS, a group of 12 former [[Soviet]] republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues.  The Armenian Government is working toward closing its Nuclear Power Plant at Medzamor near [[Yerevan]] as soon as alternative energy sources are identified.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Armenia}}
Until independence, Armenia's economy was largely [[industry]]-based ‚Äì [[chemical]]s, [[electronics]], machinery, processed [[food]], [[synthetic rubber]], and [[textile]] ‚Äì and highly dependent on outside resources.  [[Agriculture]] contributed only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenian mines produce [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[gold]], and [[lead]].  The vast majority of energy is produced with [[fuel]] imported from Russia, including [[gas]] and nuclear fuel (for its one [[nuclear power plant]]); the main domestic energy source is [[hydroelectric]].  Small amounts of [[coal]], gas, and [[petroleum]] have not yet been developed.

Like other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a [[centrally planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns.  Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function.  In addition, the effects of the 1988 [[Spitak Earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.  The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.  The closure of  Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials.  Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable.  [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] fell nearly 60% from 1989 until 1992‚Äì[[1993]].  The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth.  The 1994 cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.  New sectors, such as [[precious stone]] processing and [[jewelry]] making, [[information technology|information]] and [[communication technology]], and even [[tourism]] are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors in the economy, such as agriculture.

This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions.  The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Loans to Armenia since 1993 exceed $1.1 billion.  These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone.  The government joined the [[World Trade Organization]] on [[February 5]], [[2003]]. But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora, which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects. Being a growing democratic state, Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World.

A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a Law on Privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization.  Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and making strides against corruption.

In the 2006 [[Index of Economic Freedom]], Armenia ranked 27th best, tied with [[Japan]] and ahead of countries like [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Italy]]. However, Armenia ranked very low on property rights worse than countries like Botswana, Trinidad and Tobago.[http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/]

In the 2005 Transparency International Corruption Index Armenia ranked 88, Highly Corrupt.[http://www.transparency.org/policy_and_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005]

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Armenia}}
Armenia has a population of 2,982,904 (July 2005 est.) and is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics. There has been a problem of population decline due to elevated levels of [[emigration]] after the break-up of the [[USSR]]. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have been decreasing in the recent years, a trend which is expected to continue. In fact Armenia is expected to resume its positive population growth by 2010. 

Ethnic [[Armenians]] make up 97.9% of the population. [[Kurds]] make up 1.3%, and [[Russians]] 0.5%. There are smaller communities of [[Assyrians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Most [[Azerbaijanis]], once a sizable population, have left since independence.

Nearly all of the Armenians in [[Azerbaijan]] (approximately 120,000) now live in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. Armenia has a very large [[Armenian Diaspora|diaspora]] (8 million by some estimates, greatly exceeding the 3 million population of Armenia itself), with communities existing across the globe, including [[France]], [[Lebanon]], and [[North America]].

The predominant religion in Armenia is [[Christianity]]. The roots of the [[Armenian Church]] go back to the [[1st century|1st]] century AD. According to tradition, the [[Armenian Church]] was founded by two of Jesus' twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]s--[[Saint Jude|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew]]--who preached Christianity in Armenia in the 40's-60's AD. Because of these two founding [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]s, the official name of the [[Armenian Church]] is [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Armenia was the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion, in AD [[301]]. Over 93% of Armenian Christians belong to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], a form of Oriental (Non-[[Chalcedonian]]) Orthodoxy, which is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the [[Coptic Church|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]] churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics (both Roman and Mekhitarist - Armenian Uniate (180,000)), evangelical Protestantsand followers of the Armenian traditional religion. The [[Yazidi]] [[Kurds]], who live in the western part of the country, practise [[Yazidism]]. The [[Armenian Catholic Church]] is headquartered in [[Bzoummar]], [[Lebanon]].

Ethnic [[Azeris]] and [[Kurds]] who lived in the country before the [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]] conflict practised [[Islam]], but most Azeris were driven out of Armenia into [[Azerbaijan]] between 1988 and 1991 at the beginning of the conflict. During the same period, Armenia also received a large influx of Armenians scattered throughout Azerbaijan and large number of Azeri population migrated to Azerbaijan.

{{Main|Culture of Armenia}}
Armenians have their own highly distinctive [[Armenian alphabet|alphabet]] and [[Armenian language|language]]. 96% of the people in the country speak Armenian, while 75.8% of the population speaks [[Russian language|Russian]] as well. The adult literacy rate in Armenia is 99% [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/am.html]. Most adults in Yerevan can communicate in Russian, while [[English language|English]] is increasing in popularity.

[[Caucasus|Caucasian]] hospitality is legendary and stems from ancient tradition. Social gatherings focused around sumptuous presentations of course after course of elaborately prepared, well-seasoned (but not spicy-hot) food. The host or hostess will often put morsels on a guest's plate whenever it is empty or fill his or her glass when it gets low. After a helping or two it is acceptable to refuse politely or, more simply, just leave a little uneaten food.

The National Art Gallery in Yerevan has more than 16,000 works that date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. It houses paintings by many [[European]] masters. The Modern Art Museum, the Children‚Äôs Picture Gallery, and the [[Martiros Saryan]] Museum are only a few of the other noteworthy collections of fine art on display in Yerevan. Moreover, many private galleries are in operation, with many more opening each year. They feature rotating exhibitions and sales.

The world-class [[Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs at the beautifully refurbished city Opera House, where you can also attend a full season of opera. In addition, several chamber ensembles are highly regarded for their musicianship, including the [[National Chamber Orchestra of Armenia]] and the [[Serenade Orchestra]]. Classical music can also be heard at one of several smaller venues, including the State Music Conservatory and the Chamber Orchestra Hall. [[Jazz]] is popular, especially in the summer when live performances are a regular occurrence at one of the city‚Äôs many outdoor [[cafe|cafes]].

Yerevan‚Äôs Vernisage (arts and crafts market), close to Republic Square, bustles with hundreds of vendors selling a variety of crafts, many of superb workmanship, on weekends and Wednesdays (though the selection is much reduced mid-week). The market offers woodcarving, antiques, fine lace, and the hand-knotted wool carpets and kilims that are a Caucasus specialty. Obsidian, which is found locally, is crafted into an amazing assortment of jewelry and ornamental objects. Armenian gold smithery enjoys a long and distinguished tradition, populating one corner of the market with a selection of gold items. Soviet relics and souvenirs of recent Russian manufacture‚Äînesting dolls, watches, enamel boxes and so on, are also available at the Vernisage.

Across from the Opera House, a popular art market fills another city park on the weekends. Armenia‚Äôs long history as a crossroads of the ancient world has resulted in a landscape with innumerable fascinating archaeological sites to explore. [[Medieval]], [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]] sites are all within a few hours drive from the city. All but the most spectacular remain virtually undiscovered, allowing visitors to view churches and fortresses in their original settings.

The American University of Armenia has graduate programs in Business and Law, among others. The institution owes its existence to the combined efforts of the Government of Armenia, the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]], USAID, and the Boalt Hall School of Law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

The extension programs and the library at AUA form a new focal point for English-language intellectual life in the city. Many of the country‚Äôs most successful young entrepreneurs are graduates of this institution.

The '''Republic of Azerbaijan''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: Az…ôrbaycan or Az…ôrbaycan Respublikasƒ±) is a country in the [[Caucasus]], at the crossroads of [[Europe]] and [[Southwest Asia]], with a coast on the [[Caspian Sea]]. It has frontiers with [[Russia]] in the north, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the northwest, [[Armenia]] in the west, and [[Iran]] in the south. The [[Nakhichevan|Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]] (an [[exclave]] of Azerbaijan) borders Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and [[Turkey]] to the northwest.

Azerbaijan is a secular state, and has been a member of the [[Council of Europe]] since 2001. A majority of the population are [[Shi'a Muslim]] and of Western [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] descent, known as [[Azerbaijanis]], or simply Azeris. The country is formally an emerging [[democracy]], however with strong [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule.

== Etymology ==

There are several hypotheses regarding the origins of the name &quot;Azerbaijan.&quot; The most common theory is that it is derived from &quot;Atropatan.&quot; [[Atropat]] was the [[satrap]] at the time of the [[Persian empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid dynasty]], and gained independence after [[Alexander the Great]] destroyed the Achaemenids. The region was known as ''[[Medes|Media]] Atropatia'' or ''[[Atropatene]]'' at the time.

There are also alternative opinions that the term is a slight Turkification of ''Azarbaijan'', in turn an Arabicized version of the original Persian name ''√Çzar√¢b√¢dag√¢n'', made up of ''√¢zar+√¢badag+√¢n'' (''√¢zar''=fire; ''√¢b√¢dag''=cultivated area; ''√¢n''=suffix of pluralization); that it traditionally means &quot;the land of eternal flames&quot; or &quot;the land of fire&quot;, which is probabely implies [[Zoroastrian]] fire temples in this land. Some Azeri historians contend that the name is made up of four [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] components: ''az+er+bay+can'', which means &quot;the land of the brave Az people&quot; or &quot;an elevated place for the wealthy and exalted.&quot; &lt;!--please name some of these Azeri historians who so contend--&gt;

Historically, a large part of the territory of the present-day Azerbaijan Republic has been called [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]], named after Arran, a legendary founder of [[Caucasian Albania]]. However, the precise location identified by this name has shifted somewhat over time, currently referring to the lowland Karabakh plains situated between the [[Kura]] and [[Araks]] rivers.

Some opponents of the name ''Azerbaijan'' assert that it is anachronistic to use it in a historical context before 1918, because, they say, the term was first introduced by the national intelligentsia in early 20th century and later was endorsed by the Bolsheviks, with intention of claiming the northern province of [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. To substantiate this claim they state that until the early 20th century the population of present-day Azerbaijan had no clear ethnic identification and referred to themselves primarily as &quot;Muslims.&quot;

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Azerbaijan]]''

The earliest known inhabitants of what is today Azerbaijan were the [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, a [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]]-speaking people who appear to have been in the region prior to the host of peoples who would eventually invade the Caucasus. Historically Azerbaijan has been occupied by a variety of peoples, including [[Armenians]], [[Persians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Greek Empire]], and [[Russians]].

The first state to emerge in the territory of present-day Republic of Azerbaijan was [[Mannai|Mannae]] in the 9th century [[Anno Domini|BC]], lasting until 616 BC when it was overthrown by the [[Medes]]. The satrapies of Atropatene and [[Caucasian Albania]] were established in the [[4th century BC]] and included the approximate territories of present-day Azerbaijan and southern parts of [[Dagestan]].

[[Islam]] spread rapidly in Azerbaijan following the Arab conquests in the [[7th century|7th]]&amp;ndash;[[8th century|8th centuries]]. After the power of the Arab Khalifate waned, several semi-independent states have been formed, the Shirvanshah kingdom being one of them. In the 11th century, the conquering [[Seljuk Turks]] became the dominant force in Azerbaijan and laid the ethnic foundation of contemporary [[Azerbaijanis]] or Azeri Turks. In the [[13th century|13]]&amp;ndash;[[14th century|14th centuries]], the country experienced [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars|Tatar]] invasions.

Azerbaijan was part of the [[Safavids|Safavid state]] in [[15th century|15th]]&amp;ndash;[[18th century|18th centuries]]. It also underwent a brief period of feudal fragmentation in the mid-18th to early 19th centuries, and consisted of independent khanates. Following the two wars between the [[Qajars|Qajar dynasty]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and the [[Russian Empire]], Azerbaijan was acquired by Russia through the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813, and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1828.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during [[World War I]], Azerbaijan declared independence and established the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. This first Muslim republic in the world lasted only two years, from 1918 to 1920, before the [[Soviet]] [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan. Subsequently, Azerbaijan became part of the [[Soviet Union]].

Azerbaijan re-established its independence upon the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite a [[cease-fire]] in place since 1994, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with [[Armenia]] over the predominantly ethnic Armenian [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. Azerbaijan has lost control of 16% of its territory including Karabakh, and must support some 800,000 [[refugee]]s and internally [[displaced person]]s as a result of the conflict.

== Politics ==
''Main article: [[Politics of Azerbaijan]]''
[[Image:Ilham aliyev.jpg|right|160px|thumb|[[Ilham Aliyev]], President of Azerbaijan]]

Azerbaijan is a [[presidential republic]]. The [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] are separate from the country‚Äôs law-making body. The people elect the [[president of Azerbaijan|president]] for a five-year term of office. The president appoints all [[cabinet]]-level government administrators. A fifty-member national assembly makes the country‚Äôs laws. The people of Azerbaijan elect the [[National Assembly]]. Azerbaijan has [[universal suffrage]] above the age of eighteen.

After the presidential elections of [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|October 15, 2003]], an official release of the Central Election Committee (CEC) gave [[Isa Gambar]] ‚Äî leader of the largest opposition bloc, [[Bizim Azerbaycan]] (&quot;Our Azerbaijan&quot;) ‚Äî 14% percent of the electorate and the second place in election. Third, with 3.6%, came [[Lala Shevket|Lala Shevket Hajiyeva]], leader of the National Unity Movement, the first woman to run in presidential election in Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and other international organizations, as well as local independent political and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s voiced concern about observed vote rigging and a badly flawed counting process.

Several independent local and international organizations that had been observing and monitoring the election directly or indirectly declared [[Isa Gambar]] winner in the [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|15 October election]]. Another view shared by many international organisations is that in reality a second tour of voting should have taken place between the two opposition candidates Isa Gambar and Lala Shevket.

*[[Human Rights Watch]] commented on [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|these elections]]: &quot;Human Rights Watch research found that the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of Prime Minister Ilham Aliev, son of current President Heidar Aliev. The government has stacked the Central Election Commission and local election commission with its supporters, and banned local non-governmental organizations from monitoring the vote. As the elections draw nearer, government officials have openly sided with the campaign of Ilham Aliev, constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition events. In some cases, local officials have closed all the roads into town during opposition rallies, or have extended working and school hours‚Äîon one occasion, even declaring Sunday a workday‚Äîto prevent participation in opposition rallies.&quot; (source: [http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/azerbaijan/index.htm HTML format])

*OSCE‚Äôs final report (source: [http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/1151_en.pdf.html HTML format] or [http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2003/11/1151_en.pdf PDF format])

Azerbaijan held [[Azerbaijan parliamentary election, 2005|parliamentary elections]] on Sunday, [[6 November]] [[2005]].

== Subdivisions ==
''Main article: [[Subdivisions of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan is divided into:
*59 [[raion]]s (rayonlar; rayon &amp;ndash; singular),
*11 [[cities]] (≈ü…ôh…ôrl…ôr; ≈ü…ôh…ôr &amp;ndash; singular),
*1 [[autonomous republic]] (muxtar respublika), which itself is divided into:
**7 raions
**1 city

== Geography ==
[[Image:Map of Azerbaijan with cities.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of Azerbaijan]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan has an [[arid]] [[climate]], except in the southeast. Temperatures vary by season. In the southeast [[lowland]], temperatures average 6¬∞[[Celsius|C]] (43¬∞[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in the winter and 26¬∞C (80¬∞F) in the summer &amp;mdash; though daily maxima typically reach 32¬∞C (89¬∞F). In the northern and western [[mountain range]]s, temperatures average 12¬∞C (55¬∞F) in the summer and &amp;ndash;9¬∞C (20¬∞F) in the winter.

Annual rainfall over most of the country varies from 200 to 400 millimetres (8 to 16&amp;nbsp;in) and is generally lowest in the northeast. In the far southeast, however, the climate is much moister and annual rainfall can be as high as 1300 [[millimetre]]s (51 [[inch|in]]). For most of the country, the wettest periods are in spring and autumn, with summers being the driest.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Azerbaijan]]''

The economy is largely based on [[industry]]. Industries include machine manufacture, [[petroleum]] and other [[mining]], petroleum [[refining]], [[textiles|textile]] production, and chemical processing. [[Agriculture]] accounts for one-third of Azerbaijan‚Äôs economy. Most of the nation‚Äôs farms are [[irrigation|irrigated]]. In the lowlands, farmers grow such crops as [[cotton]], [[fruit]], [[cereal|grain]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], and many types of [[vegetable]]s. [[Silkworm]]s are raised for the production of natural [[silk]] for the clothing industry. Azerbaijan‚Äôs herders raise [[cattle]], [[domestic sheep]] and [[goat]]s near the mountain ranges. [[Seafood]] and [[fish]] are caught in the nearby [[Caspian Sea]]. Azerbaijan has a highly dynamic economy, mainly because of oil, and has a GDP growth rate of up to 11% a year.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan has population of roughly 7,911,974 (July 2005 est.), 90.6% of whom are ethnic [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] (also called Azeris; 1999 census figures). Azeris also form about 24% of the population of [[Iran]], predominating in the northern regions of the country. Most of Armenia‚Äôs Azeri minority have left since independence and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] war. The second largest ethnic group are [[Russians]], who now form roughly 1.8% of the population, most having emigrated since independence.
The [[Talysh]], an Iranian people, predominate in the southernmost regions of the country around the Talysh mountains and across the border into Iran. Some people argue that the number of [[Talysh]] is greater than officially recorded, as many of them are counted as Azerbaijanis.
Numerous 'Dagestani' peoples live around the border with [[Dagestan]]. The main peoples are the [[Lezgis]], [[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] and the [[Tsakhur]]. Smaller groups include the [[Budukh]], [[Udi]], [[Kryts]] and [[Khinalug]]/Ketsh around the village of [[Xinaliq]]. Around the town of [[Quba]] in the north live the [[Tats]], also known as the [[Mountain Jews]], who are also to be found in Dagestan. Many Tats have emigrated to [[Israel]] in recent years, though this trend has slowed and even reversed more recently.
The country‚Äôs large Armenian population mostly fled to [[Armenia]] and to other countries with the beginning of the Armenian-Azeri conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. During the same period, Azerbaijan also received a large influx of Azerbaijanis fleeing Armenia and later [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and adjacent provinces occupied by the Armenians. Almost all of Azerbaijan‚Äôs Armenians now live in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Azerbaijan also contains numerous smaller groups, such as [[Kurds]], [[Georgians]], [[Tatars]] and [[Ukrainians]].

Most Azerbaijanis (about 60‚Äì70%) are [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslim]]. Other [[religion]]s or  beliefs that are followed by many in the country are the orthodox [[Sunni]] Islam, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] (in Karabakh), the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and various other Christian and Muslim sects. The Tat in [[Quba]], as well as several thousand [[Ashkenazim Jews]] in Baku, follow [[Judaism]]. Adherence to religious dogmas is nominal for the majority of the population and attitudes are secular. Traditionally, villages around Baku and the [[Lenkoran]] region are considered stronghold of Shi‚Äòism, and in some northern regions populated by Sunni Dagestani people, the Salafi sect has gained a following. Folk Islam is widely practiced, but an organized [[Sufi]] movement is absent.

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Azerbaijan]]''

The official language of Azerbaijan is [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], a member of the [[Oguz]] subdivision of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]], and is spoken by around 95% of the republic‚Äôs population, as well as about a third of the population of Iran. Its closest relatives in language are [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. As a result of the language policy of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russian language|Russian]] is also commonly spoken as a second language among the urbane. There are also speakers of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in the state. Azerbaijan‚Äôs culture has long cultural roots with [[Iran]] and [[Iranian peoples]].{{fact}}

'''Amateur astronomy''', often called '''back yard astronomy''' in the US, is a [[hobby]] whose participants enjoy observing celestial objects.  It is usually associated with viewing the [[night sky]] when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as [[sunspot]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.

Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] and [[binoculars]].

== Amateur astronomy and scientific research ==

Unlike professional astronomy, scientific research is not always the ''main'' goal for many amateur astronomers.  Work of scientific merit is certainly possible, however, and many amateurs contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers very successfully.  Astronomy is often promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data. 

The majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection.  In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers.  Several organisations, such as the Center for Backyard Astrophysics [http://cba.phys.columbia.edu/], exist to help coordinate these contributions.

In particular, amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of [[variable star]]s, helping to track [[asteroid]]s, and observing [[occultation]]s to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the [[Moon]] as seen from Earth.

In the past and present, amateur astronomers have also played a major role in discovering new [[comet]]s.  Recently however, funding of projects such as the [[LINEAR|Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] and [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] projects has meant that ''most'' comets are now discovered by automated systems, long before it is possible for amateurs to see them. 

A newer role for amateurs is searching for overlooked phenomena (e.g. [[Kreutz Sungrazers]]) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by Earth and space based observatories, much of which is available over the Internet.

== Societies for amateur astronomy ==

There are a large number of [[astronomical society|amateur astronomical societies]] around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy, whether they be people who are actively interested in observing or &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; who may be simply interested in the topic.  Societies range widely in their goals, depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread, local circumstances, size and membership.  For instance, a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular meetings with speakers, focusing less on observing the night sky if the membership is less able to observe due to factors such as [[light pollution]].

It is common for local societies to hold regular meetings, which may include activities such as [[star party|star parties]].  Other activities could include [[amateur telescope making]], which was pioneered in America by [[Russell W. Porter]], who later played a major role in design and construction of the [[Hale Telescope]].

== Approaches to using amateur telescopes ==

Amateur telescopes come in many shapes and sizes, both commercial and home-built.  The preferences of people who use them often differ.

=== Star hopping ===

Some amateur astronomers prefer to learn the sky as accurately as they can, using maps to find their way between the stars.  In this case a common approach is to use binoculars or a manually driven telescope, combined with star maps, to locate items of interest in the sky.  The normal technique for doing this, by locating landmark stars and &quot;hopping&quot; between them, is called [[star hopping]].

=== GOTO telescopes ===

More recently as technology has improved and prices have come down, automated &quot;GOTO&quot; telescopes have also become a popular choice.  With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item they wish to look at, and the telescope finds it in the sky automatically with comparatively little further effort required by the user.

The main advantage of a &quot;GOTO&quot; telescope for an experienced amateur astronomer is the reduction of &quot;wasted&quot; time that may have otherwise been used in trying to find a particular object.  This time can therefore be used more effectively for ''studying'' the object.

=== Comparing methodologies ===

There is significant (though usually light-hearted) debate within the hobby about which method is better.  Promoters of the [[star hopping]] approach for finding items in the sky usually argue that they know the sky much better as a result.  The manual method also tends to require simpler equipment with less calibration and setup time, and is therefore more versatile.  Promoters of &quot;GOTO&quot; telescopes often argue that they are more interested in studying objects, and the reward of finding them or learning exactly where they are is not as important to them.

It may also be argued that the money spent on complex electronics and mounting systems might be better spent on higher quality optics.

== Additional tools and activities ==

In addition to optical equipment, amateur astronomers use a variety of other tools such as celestial maps, and specialised computer software.  There is a range of [[astronomy software]] available, from planetarium programs that simulate the sky to programs used to do various kinds of calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.

Most amateur astronomers also keep a record of their observations. This can take the form of an [[astronomical observing log|observing log]], in which they record details about which objects were observed and describing the details that were seen. [[Astrophotography]] and sketching are also popularly used to record observations.

== Beginning in amateur astronomy ==

There are a many ways for people to become involved in amateur astronomy and study the night sky.  One option is to join a local [[astronomical society]], the members of which will often be very happy to help a newcomer take a more active part.  Some people also prefer to simply teach themselves, in which case there are likely to be a large amount of books in the local library.

Common objects that are observed early are the [[Moon]] and [[planet]]s.  Another thing that most newcomers to amateur astronomy become acquainted with are the more prominent [[constellation]]s in the night sky.  When reading maps and interpreting instructions for future [[star hopping]], constellations are good starting points for identifying locations in the night sky.  They are frequently referred to by amateur astronomers when discussing the location of items of interest when looked at with binoculars and telescopes.

=== Beginning with a GOTO telescope ===

A relatively new ''type'' of beginning amateur astronomer, brought about by the increased affordability of powerful &quot;GOTO&quot; telescopes, is one who begins with such a telescope.  It is possible for an inexperienced person to immediately look at a large amount of deep sky objects in the night sky without necessarily having any prior experience or training.

There is currently some debate among amateur astronomers about the merits of this approach to becoming involved in the hobby, and the effects that low-priced GOTO telescopes may be having.  Amateur astronomy is exposed to more people, as an individual is less likely to be discouraged by the need to learn how to locate objects in the night sky before being able to see them.  Some are concerned, however, that newcomers may become bored very quickly.  A GOTO telescope does not distinguish between objects that are easy and hard to see, and newcomers may therefore begin with objects that require large amounts of experience or understanding to properly appreciate.

=== Becoming acquainted with the night sky ===

Most tutors agree that it is very important to know one's way around the sky by means of the constellations. This ability forms a platform from which deeper explorations of the sky are then possible. 

A planisphere can be used to find and identify the constellations.  These devises show the location of the constellations for any time of the night or time of the year. An observer will also need a red flashlight to read star charts or the planisphere.  Use of a red light helps preserve the dark adaptation of the eyes.   

Having learned the main constellations, a beginner may want to extend their hobby and buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope.

==== Using binoculars ====

With [[binoculars]] it is possible to see many [[deep sky object]]s (DSOs). Holding the binoculars can produce a shaky image. One way to improve the view is with the aid of a sturdy tripod mount to steady the view through the binoculars. Binoculars are still limited in range, although most of the [[Messier]] catalogue should be visible, as well as a great many [[New General Catalogue|NGC]]'s, especially near the [[Milky Way]]. An advantage of binoculars is that they allow more complete wide field views of the larger [[open clusters]] such as the [[Pleiades]], the [[Hyades]], the [[Coma Berenices]] cluster and [[Praesepe]], for example, of which only portions are usually observable in one [[field of view]] at higher magnifications.

==== Using a telescope ====

With a telescope, the sky really comes alive, especially one that has an [[aperture]] of six inches or more. Some amateur telescopes are [[telescope making|built]] by their owners from scratch, but many good quality telescopes can be purchased from reputable companies. Thousands of DSOs are visible in a telescope and the determined amateur with a large (about 41 cm) telescope can push this to tens of thousands or more.

Another type of telescope to consider, especially if the amateur is observing with children, is a wide-field telescope, such as Edmund Scientific's f/4 Astroscan compact [[Reflecting_telescope|reflector]]. This type of telescope is typically a short tube [[reflector telescope|reflector]] and has an [[aperture]] of only 80 to 120 mm (3 1/4 to 4 3/4 inches), but is easier to target an object, since it offers a much wider field of view.  With the aid of high power lenses (i.e. eyepieces), the amateur can zoom in on planets and some of the closer DSOs.  It is the best of a blend of a telescope's narrow long range light gathering ability with a binocular's wider field of view.  

Those who are particularly interested in observing the moon and planets may prefer a high-power design such as the [[Maksutov telescope]].

With any telescope, though, the mount is the most important feature.  A tripod that doesn't shake every time one uses it is a must.  Too many amateur astronomers give up because they have a hard time targeting an object.  If the mounting tripod is rock solid, the amateur can enjoy their time observing the heavens instead of fighting with the telescope.

==== Astrophotography ====
[[Image:Comet_Hale_Bopp_reduced.jpg|thumbnail|right|A photo taken of Comet Hale Bopp using a standard [[35 mm film|35 mm]] camera with a 50 mm lens and 400 ISO film.  The exposure was taken for 10 seconds on a tripod using a shutter cable release.]]

The next step in an amateur astronomer's quest for more space adventure could be the purchase of a good camera for [[Astrophotography]].  Starting out with a good 35 mm camera with a 50 mm lens mounted on a tripod and using a cable release and 400 or faster speed film, the amateur can capture some nice pictures of the planets and some larger nebula, like the [[Orion Nebula]].  Some of the larger comets and prolific meteor showers can be photographed this way as well.

As one progresses, cameras can be mounted directly on to telescopes, capturing on film many DSOs.  Special films and even the technique of hypering the film has been employed by the amateur.  Many  publications accept these astrophotos in their [[magazines]], [[i.e.]], ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' and ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]''.

A more recent development is the use of [[webcam|webcams]] to do [[speckle imaging]] (also known as ''video astronomy''). The resulting short exposure frames can be stacked using the [[shift-and-add]] method of [[speckle imaging]] or selected to do [[lucky imaging]], all using commercially available astronomy software.

==== Sketching ====
As an alternative to photography in order to make a record of observations, amateurs also use sketching. Sketching does not require the use of any specialized equipment and is therefore suitable for beginners as well as advanced amateur observers. There are different approaches to sketching that require different tools, simple pencil sketches can sometimes be used to make accurate renditions of what the observer sees through binoculars or a telescope. As the expewrience of the observer increases, more advanced drawing tools and techniques can be employed.

Sketching has the advantage of helping the observer scrutinize the object that is seen and can help bring out details that otherwise might have been overlooked.

'''Aikido''' (ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅì ''Aikid≈ç'', also ÂêàÊ∞£ÈÅì using an older style of [[kanji]]), literally meaning 'joining energy way', is a [[gendai budo]] ‚Äî a modern [[Japan]]ese [[martial art]]. Practitioners of Aikido are known as '''aikidoka'''. It was developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] (Ê§çËäùÁõõÂπ≥) (also known by Aikidoka as [[o-sensei]] (ÁøÅÂÖàÁîü) over the period of the [[1930s]] to the [[1960s]]. Technically, the major parts of Aikido are derived from [[Daito Ryu|Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu]] (Â§ßÊù±ÊµÅÂêàÊ∞óÊüîË°ì), a form of Jujutsu with many joint techniques, and [[kenjutsu]] (Ââ£Ë°ì), or Japanese sword technique (some believe the tactics in Aikido are especially influenced by [[Yagyu Shinkage-ryu|Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´]]). Aikido is also considered to contain a significant [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component.

==History==
The name aikido is formed of three Japanese characters, ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅì, usually romanised as ai, [[qi|ki]] and [[do]]. These are often translated as meaning union, universal energy and way, so aikido can be translated as 'the way to union with universal energy'. Another common interpretation of the characters is harmony, spirit and way, so Aikido can also mean 'the way of spiritual harmony'. Both interpretations draw attention to the fact that aikido's techniques are designed to control an attacker by controlling and redirecting their energy instead of blocking it. An analogy is often made of the way a flexible willow bends with the storm, whereas the stout oak will break if the wind blows too hard. (The Korean [[martial arts|martial art]] commonly known as [[hapkido]] uses the same three characters: some suggest a historical link through [[Daito-ryu]], the main origin of aikido).

Morihei Ueshiba developed aikido mainly from Daito-ryu [[aikijutsu]], incorporating training movements such as those for the ''[[yari]]'' ([[spear]]), ''[[jo (weapon)|jo]]'' (a short [[quarterstaff]]), and perhaps also ''juken'' ([[bayonet]]).  But arguably the strongest influence is that of the [[katana]] ([[sword]]).  In many ways, an aikido practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman.  The aikido strikes ''shomenuchi'' and ''yokomenuchi'' originated from weapon attacks, and resultant techniques likewise from weapon take-aways.  Some schools of aikido do no weapons training at all; others, such as [[Iwama Ryu]] usually spend substantial time with ''[[bokken]]''/bokuto (wooden sword), ''[[jo (weapon)|jo]]'', and ''[[tanto]]'' (knife). In some lines of aikido, all techniques can be performed with a sword as well as unarmed. 

Aikido was first brought to the West in [[1951]] by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] with a visit to [[France]]. It was introduced to the [[United States]] in [[1953]] by [[Kenji Tomiki]] and, a little later in the same year by [[Koichi Tohei]].  The [[United Kingdom]] followed in [[1955]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]] in [[1965]].  Today there are many aikido [[dojo]]s available to train at throughout the world.

==Technique==
Aikido incorporates a wide range of techniques which use principles of energy and motion to redirect, neutralise and control attackers. One of the central martial philosophies of aikido is to be able to handle multiple-attacker circumstances fluidly. ''[[Randori]]'', practice against multiple opponents, is a key part of the curriculum in most aikido schools and is required for the higher level belts. Another tenet of aikido is that the aikidoka should gain control of their opponent as quickly as possible, while causing the least amount of damage possible to either party. If performed correctly, size and strength are not important for the techniques to be effective.

===Training===
The methods of training vary from organisation to organisation, and indeed even between different [[dojo]] in a single organisation. Typically, however, a class consists of a teacher demonstrating techniques or principles which the students then practice. Training is done through mutual technique, where the focus is on entering and blending (harmonising) with the attack, rather than on meeting force with force. ''Uke'', the receiver of the technique, usually initiates an attack against ''nage'' (also referred to as ''tori'' or ''shite'' depending on Aikido style), who neutralises it with an aikido technique. The uke and the nage have equally important roles.  Uke's role is to be honest and committed in attack, to use positioning to protect oneself, and to learn proper technique through the imbalanced feeling created by nage's technique.  Nage's role is to blend with and neutralise uke's attack without leaving an opening to further attacks.  Simultaneously nage will be studying how to create a feeling of being centred (on balance) and controlled in the application of the Aikido technique.  Therefore, students must practise both positions in order to learn proper technique. When O-Sensei taught, all his students were uke until he deemed them knowledgeable enough of the technique to be nage. Movement, awareness, precision, distance and timing are all important to the execution of techniques as students progress from rigidly defined exercises to more fluid and adaptable applications.  Eventually, students take part in ''jiyu-waza'' (free attack) and/or [[randori]], where the attacks are less predictable.  Most schools employ training methods wherein uke actively attempts to employ counter-techniques, or ''kaeshi-waza''.  

O-Sensei did not allow competition in training because some techniques were considered too dangerous and because he believed that competition did not develop good character in students. Most styles of aikido continue this tradition although [[Tomiki Aikido|Shodokan Aikido]] (see [[#Styles|Styles]]) started with competitions early on. In the [[Ki Society]] there are forms (''[[taigi]]'') competitions held from time to time.

====Defense====
Aikido techniques are largely designed towards keeping the attacker off balance and locking joints. Much of aikido's repertoire of defenses can be performed either as throwing techniques (''nage-waza'') or as pins (''katame-waza''), depending on the situation. Entering, ''irimi'', and turning, ''tenkan'', are widely used aikido concepts, as is striking, ''atemi''. The use of striking techniques is dependent on the organization and, to some extent, the individual dojo. Some dojo teach the strikes that are integral to all aikido techniques as mere distractions used to make the application of an aikido technique easier, while others teach that strikes are to be used for more destructive reasons. O-Sensei himself wrote, while describing the aikido technique ikkyo, &quot;...first smash the eyes.&quot; (This might well refer to the fact that the classic opener for ikkyo is a knife-hand thrust towards the face, to make uke block and thus expose his or her arm to the joint control - thus, ''as though'' moving to smash uke's eyes.)  Manipulation of uke's balance by entering is often referred to as &quot;taking uke's center&quot;. It is sometimes said that Aikido contains only defense, and the attacks that are performed are not really aikido. From a historical perspective this claim is questionable, but many if not most aikidoka have the defense techniques as the focus of their training.

====Attacks====
In the early days when Ueshiba began teaching to the public, students tended to be proficient in another martial art. Due to this, attacks per se are generally not focused on in contemporary aikido dojos. Students will learn the various attacks from which an Aikido technique can be practiced. Although attacks seldom are studied to the same extent as some arts, good attacks are needed to study correct and effective application of technique. &quot;Honest&quot; attacks are considered important. An &quot;honest&quot; attack would be an attack with full intention or a strong neutral (neither pulling or pushing) grab or hold. The speed of an attack may vary depending on the experience and level of the &quot;nage&quot; (the partner who executes the throw or technique). Whether the attack is fast or slow, the uke's intention to strike or control (if grabbing or pinning) should remain, in order to provide the nage a realistic training scenario. 

Aikido attacks used in normal training include various stylized strikes and grabs such as ''shomenuchi'' (a vertical strike to the head), ''yokomenuchi'' (a lateral strike to the side of the head and/or neck), ''munetsuki'' (a straight punch), ''ryotedori'' (a two handed grab) or ''katadori'' (a shoulder grab).  Many of the ''-uchi'' strikes resemble blows from a sword or other weapon.  Kicks are sometimes used, but are not usually part of basic curricula.   Most aikido techniques can also be applied to a response to an attack, e.g. to a block, and some schools use this as the &quot;basic&quot; form of a given class of technique.  Beginners also tend to work with techniques executed in response to a grab.  Grabs are considered good for basic practice because the connection with uke is very clear and strong, and it is easier to &quot;feel out&quot; body mechanics and lines of force.

There is also the matter of ''atemi'', or strikes employed during an aikido technique.  The role and importance of atemi is a matter of some debate in aikido. Some view atemi as strikes to &quot;vital points&quot; that can be delivered during the course of a technique's application, to increase effectiveness.   Others consider atemi to be methods of distraction, particularly when aimed at the face.  For instance, if a movement would expose the aikido practitioner to a counter-blow, he or she may deliver a quick strike to distract the attacker or occupy the threatening limb.  (Such a strike will also usually break the target's concentration, making them easier to throw than if they are able to focus on resisting.)  Atemi can be interpreted as not only punches or kicks but also, for instance, striking with a shoulder or a large part of the arm. Some throws are arguably effected through an unbalancing or abrupt application of atemi.  [http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html Many sayings about atemi] are attributed to [[Morihei Ueshiba]], although their precise content varies considerably based on the one doing the telling.

====Weapons====
Weapons training in aikido usually consists of [[jo (weapon)|jo]] (4-foot staff), [[bokken]] (wooden sword), and wooden (or sometimes rubber) [[tanto]] (knife).  Both weapons-taking and weapons-retention are sometimes taught, to integrate the armed and unarmed aspects of aikido.  For example, a technique done with a straight punch may be done with a tanto or jo thrust instead, or a grab technique may be illustrated as a way to draw/strike with a weapon while being grabbed.

Many schools use versions of [[Morihiro Saito]]'s weapons system: aiki-jo and aiki-ken. The system contains solo [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]] with jo, and paired exercises for both jo and bokken. Some lineages use bokken kata derived from older sword schools. Also, quite a few aikido teachers, such as [[Mitsugi Saotome]] and [[Kazuo Chiba]], have developed their own weapons systems.  This is largely due to the fact that O'Sensei did not teach weapons to his students, excepting a few.

===Clothing===
The [[aikidogi]] used in Aikido is similar to the [[keikogi]] used in most other modern [[budo]] arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. In some places a keikogi of [[karate]] cut is preferred, in others most people use [[judo]] keikogis. Keikogi made specially for aikido exist, but usually not in the lower price ranges. Many dojos insist that the sleeves are cut short to elbow length, to reduce the risk of trapped fingers and injuries in grab techniques to the wrist.

To the keikogi adds the traditional garment [[hakama]], wide pleated trousers. The hakama is usually black or dark blue and in most dojos, the hakama is reserved for practitioners with dan (black belt) ranks. Systems also exist where hakama is never worn or are worn from a specific kyu rank; others exist where women are allowed to wear it earlier than men.

The belt, ''obi'' is wrapped twice around the body similar to in karate or judo. Although some systems use many belt colours similar to the system in judo, the most common version is that dan ranks wear black belt, and kyu ranks white - sometimes with an additional brown belt for the highest kyu ranks. In some dojos it is common to have the same color belt at different levels.

==Spirituality==
The ending &quot;[[do]]&quot; in the word aikido indicates a spiritual path, unlike the ending &quot;jutsu&quot; in the word aikijujutsu, which indicates a system of techniques. Many people see this difference as important as well as regarding [[iaido|iaijutsu]] and [[iaido]], [[jujutsu]] and [[judo]], and [[kenjutsu]] and [[kendo]]. Others see this distinction as a historically incorrect and somewhat unnatural division.  For example, literally, do refers to a path and jitsu to a technique: therefore, some argue, aikido involves both a way (do) and technical study (jutsu).

Ueshiba taught that, while it was important to become proficient in physical technique, this is not the ultimate purpose of training. He taught that the principles learned through training in physical technique are universal and are to be applied to all aspects of one's life. He once commented that he was teaching students not how to move their feet but, rather, how to move their minds.

Many agree that Ueshiba's style became softer, more fluid, and effortless as he grew older. Some suggest this was due to a shift in focus to the spiritual aspects of the art, while others suggest that this was simply a natural result of Ueshiba becoming more proficient in physical technique. Various interpretations have arisen since Ueshiba's death.

A range of aikido schools can be found, each placing a different emphasis on physical techniques, underlying principles, and spiritual concepts. This is largely a result of at what point the founder of each of these schools trained with Ueshiba--earlier or later in Ueshiba's life. The former tend to focus more on physical technique, while the latter tend to focus more on spiritual concepts.  However, this should not be overstated, especially since there is considerable variance from sensei to sensei, and an &quot;aikido continuum&quot; is quite problematic to actually construct.  Some aikidoka view &quot;physical vs. spiritual&quot; as a false separation, or a failed attempt to stereotype branches of aikido.

[[Ki Society]] is an example of a school that focuses heavily on the spiritual concepts of aikido, rather than physical technique. 

===Ki===
[[Image:ki-obsolete.png|left|float|200px|Obsolete form of the ki kanji]]
The Japanese character for [[Qi|ki]], is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice. The steam being contained within, is ki. This same word is applied to the ability to harness one's own 'breath power', 'power', or 'energy'. This 'ki' is the same as the 'qi' in [[Qigong|qi-gong]], but many people argue it is not the same as the 'chi' in [[Tai Chi Chuan|t'ai chi]]. When [[aikidoka]] say that someone is training with a lot of ki, they usually want to express that the person is very non-forcefully compelling in the execution of his technique. Timing, a sense for the correct distance and a centered (undisturbed) mind and body are particularly important. Most teachers claim to locate ki in the [[hara (Martial Arts)|hara]], which might be loosely defined as the body's center of gravity, situated in the lower abdomen, about two inches below and behind the navel. In training it is constantly emphasized that one should keep one's hara ‚Äî that is, remain ''centered''. Very high ranking teachers sometimes reach a level of coordination that enables them to execute techniques with very little apparent movement, sometimes even without seeming to touch their opponent's body.

Essentially, ki corresponds to the physical concepts of center of gravity, center of momentum, and center of force.  However, these centers are not necessarily the same, so ki also encompasses the biological and mental aspect of training oneself to have exquisite control over motion.

The &quot;spiritual&quot; interpretation of ki depends very much on what school of aikido one studies, as some emphasize it more than others.  Ki Society dojos, for example, tend to spend much more time on ki-related training activities than do, for example, Yoshinkan dojos.  The importance of ki in aikido cannot be denied -- the name of the martial art, after all, can be translated as &quot;the meeting of ki&quot;.  But what ki is, is debated by many within the discipline.  O-Sensei himself appears to have changed his views over time -- for example, Yoshinkan Aikido, which largely follows O-Sensei's teachings from before the war, is considerably more martial in nature, reflecting a younger, more violent and less spiritual O-Sensei.  Within this school, ki perhaps could be better thought of as having its original Chinese meaning of breath, and aikido as coordination of movement with breath to maximize power.  As O-Sensei evolved and his views changed, his teachings took on a much more ethereal feel, and many of his later students (almost all now high ranking senseis within the Aikikai) teach about ki from this perspective.

==Body==
Aikido training is for all-around physical fitness, flexibility, and [[relaxation]].  The human body in general can exert power in two ways: contractive and expansive (aikidofaq.com).  Many fitness activities, for example weight-lifting, emphasize the former, which means that specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, and power.  The disadvantage of this, however, is that whole body movement and coordination are rarely stressed.  Thus, while muscle size and power may increase, there is no emphasis on the ways in which those muscles can work together most efficiently.  Also, this sort of training tends to increase tension, decrease flexibility, and stress the joints.  The result may be aesthetically pleasing, but when done to excess may actually be detrimental to overall health. 

The second type of power, expansive, is mostly stressed in activities such as dance or gymnastics.  In these activities, the body must learn to move in a coordinated manner and with relaxation. Aikido also mostly stresses this sort of training.  While both types of power are important, it is interesting to note that a person who masters the second type of power can, in a martial context, often overcome a person who is much bigger or stronger.   The reason for this is that the contractive power is only as great as the mass and power of your individual muscles.  Expansive power, however, as used in Aikido, can be much greater than your size may lead you to believe.  This is because you move with your whole body.  Rather than stressing and tensing only a few muscles, you learn to relax and move from the center of your body, where you are most powerful.  Power is then extended out naturally through the relaxed limbs, which become almost whip-like in their motion. Needless to say, the power behind an entire person's body will be more than that of someone's arm or leg alone.

Hence, aikido develops the body in a unique manner.  Aerobic fitness is obtained through vigorous training.  Flexibility of the joints and connective tissues is developed through various stretching exercises and through the techniques themselves.  [[Relaxation]] is learned automatically, since without it the techniques will not function.  A balanced use of contractive and expansive power is mastered, enabling even a small person to pit his entire body's energy against their opponent.

With this, different masters stress different aspects of training. Some masters stress importance of body posture while executing the technique in order to coordinate different parts of the body, while others deal with the physical aspects of it. With each way, comes a different means of interpretation of the same basic principles of the art which is discussed in more detail above.

==Mind==
Aikido training does not consider the body and mind as independent entities. The condition of one affects the other. For example, the physical relaxation learned in aikido also becomes a mental relaxation. Likewise, the confidence that develops mentally is manifested in a more confident style. [[Psychological]] or spiritual insight learned during training must become reflected in the body, else it will vanish under pressure, when more basic, ingrained patterns and reflexes take over. Aikido training requires the student to squarely face conflict, not to run away from it.  Through this experience, an Aikido student may learn to face other areas of life in a similarly proactive fashion, rather than in with avoidance and fear.

==Styles==
The major styles of aikido each have their own [[Hombu Dojo]] in [[Japan]], have an international breadth and were founded by direct students of [[Morihei Ueshiba]].  Although there has been an explosion of &quot;independent styles&quot; generally only the first five listed have been considered major.  [[Iwama style|Iwama Ryu]] is a debatable sixth as, although its influence is major, it has until recently been part of the [[Aikikai]] (see below).

* [[Aikikai]] is the largest aikido organisation, and is led by the family of the founder. Numerous sub-organisations and teachers affiliate themselves with this umbrella organisation, which therefore encompasses a wide variety of aikido styles, training methods and technical differences. These sub-organisations are often centred around prominant [[Shihan]] and are usually organised at the national level, although sub-national and inter-national sub-organisations exist.  Please see [[List of famous aikidoka]] for more detail.

*[[Yoshinkan]] Founded by [[Gozo Shioda]], has a reputation for being the most rigidly precise. Students of Yoshinkan aikido practise basic movements as solo kata, and this style has been popular among the Japanese police.  The international organization associated with the Yoshinkan style of aikido is known as the Yoshinkai, and has active branches in many parts of the world.

*[[Yoseikan]] was founded by [[Minoru Mochizuki]], who was an early student of O-Sensei and also of Jigoro Kano at the [[Kodokan]].   This style includes elements of aiki-budo together with aspects of karate, judo and other arts. It is now carried on by his son, [[Hiroo Mochizuki]], the creator of [[Yoseikan Budo]].

*[[Tomiki Aikido|Shodokan Aikido]] (often called Tomiki aikido, after its founder) use sparring and rule based competition in training as opposed to most others. People tend to compete to train rather than to train to compete.  [[Kenji Tomiki]], an early student of O-Sensei and also of judo's [[Jigoro Kano]], believed that introducing an element of competition would serve to sharpen and focus the practice since it was no longer tested in real combat. This latter view was the cause of a split with O-Sensei's family who firmly believed that there was no place for competition in aikido training.  Tomiki said that at no point did O-Sensei actually cast him out.  

*The [[Ki Society]], founded by former head-instructor of the Hombu dojo 10th dan [[Koichi Tohei]], emphasizes very soft flowing techniques and has a special program for the development of [[ki]]. It also has a special system of ki-ranks alongside the traditional [[kyu]] and [[dan]] system. This style is called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]] (or [[Ki-Aikido]]). 

*[[Iwama style|Iwama Ryu]] emphasizes the relation between weapon techniques and barehand techniques, and a great deal of emphasis is placed on weapons training. Since the death of its founder [[Morihiro Saito]], the [[Iwama style]] has been practiced by clubs within the Aikikai and an independent organization headed by [[Hitohiro Saito]]. Saito sensei was a long time uchideshi of O-Sensei, beginning in 1946 and staying with him through his death. Many consider that Saito sensei was the student who spent most time directly studying with O-Sensei. Saito sensei said he was trying to preserve and teach the art exactly as the founder of aikido taught it to him. Technically, Iwama-ryu seems to resemble the aikido O-Sensei was teaching in the early 50s mainly in the Iwama dojo. The technical repertoire is fairly large.  The new, separate from Aikikai, Iwama Ryu Aikido has been renamed Iwama Shin Shin Aikishurenkai. 

*[[Shin'ei Taido]] Founded by the late [[Noriaki Inoue]], nephew of [[Morihei Ueshiba]].    

*[[Yoshokai]] aikido, begun by then-hachidan Takashi Kushida of Yoshinkan aikido, is a remarkably centralized style of aikido, with test techniques yearly passed down with explanations from the home dojo.  The syllabus contains a considerable amount of weapons study, and like Yoshinkan, Yoshokai includes many solo movements and exercises.

*[[Doshinkan]] aikido, begun by Yukio Utada of Yoshinkan aikido.  Utada was a student of both the Yoshinkan founder Gozo Shioda and Yoshokai founder Takashi Kushida. Like Yoshokai, the syllabus also contains a considerable amount of weapons study, and like Yoshinkan, Doshinkan includes many solo movements and exercises. Doshinkan Aikido (Aikido Association of North America and Doshinkan Aikido International) is still affiliated with the International Yoshinkan Aikido Federation.

*[[Tendo-ryu Aikido|Tendoryu Aikido]] Headed by [[Kenji Shimizu]].

*[[Shin Budo Kai]] headed by [[Shizuo Imaizumi]].

*[[Kokikai]] aikido, founded by [[Shuji Maruyama]] in 1986, focuses on minimalist but effective technique.  It emphasizes natural stances and [[ukemi]] that do not require high [[breakfalls]], and deemphasizes [[atemi]] and techniques that cause pain or undue discomfort to [[uke]].  As such, it is considered by some to be a &quot;soft&quot; style of aikido.

*[[Seidokan]] Aikido, founded by [[Rod Kobayashi]].  Tends to utilize movements which are very small and economical.  Encourages students to discover an aikido which is truly their own, stresses the importance of doing away with the extraneous and focusing on that which works

*[[Nippon Kan]] Headed by [[Gaku Homma]].

*[[Nishio AIkido]] a part of the Aikikai although techically well defined according to its head [[Shoji Nishio]]. Nishio Sensei passed away in March 2005.

*[[Nihon Goshin Aikido]] Headed by Richard Bowe. It is considered a &quot;hard&quot; style of aikido, combining techniques from karate, Judo and Daito-Ryu Aikijutsu. There are roughly a dozen dojos in the United States and none left in Japan. Founded by Shoto Morita in Japan circa 1950. Derivative styles include Nihon Goshin Aikijutsu founded by Walter Kopitov in 2000. For more information see &quot;The Black Belt Master Course in Nihon Goshin Aikido&quot;.

*[[Takemusu Aiki Tomita Academy]]. Academy for the development of Takemusu Aiki founded in 1992 by [[Takeji Tomita]].  This training method incorporates [[Tai-Jutsu]], [[Aiki-Ken]] and [[Aiki-Jo]] for the study of the inter-related principles of Takemusu Aiki and Japanese [[Budo]].

*[[Aiki Manseido]] Headed by [[Kanshu Sunadomari]].  Independent style centred in [[Kyushu]], Japan.

==Aikidoka==
It is sometimes said that in  [[Japan]] the term ''aikidoka'' (ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅìÂÆ∂) mainly refers to a [[professional]] while in the west, any one who practices may call themselves an aikidoka. The term ''aikidoist'' is also used as a more general term, especially by those who prefer to maintain the more restricted, Japanese, meaning of the term aikidoka.

By its original and broadest definition, '''''[[art]]''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', meaning &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft&quot;) is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge and a set of skills; this meaning is preserved in such phrases as &quot;[[liberal arts]]&quot; and &quot;[[martial arts]]&quot;. However, in the modern use of the word, which rose to prominence during the [[Renaissance]], ''art'' is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works (or '''artwork''') which, from concept to creation, adhere to the &quot;[[creativity|creative]] impulse&quot;&amp;mdash;that is, art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity, by biological drive, or by any undisciplined pursuit of [[recreation]]. By both definitions of the word, artistic works have existed for almost as long as [[human|humankind]], from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]].

The '''creative arts''' are a collection of disciplines whose principal purpose is in the output of material that is compelled by a personal drive and echoes or reflects a message, mood, and [[symbolism]] for the viewer to interpret. As such, the term ''art'' may be taken to include forms as diverse as [[prose]] [[writing]], [[poetry]], [[dance]], [[acting]], [[music]], [[sculpture]] and [[painting]]. In addition to serving as a method of pure creativity and self-expression, the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically-, religiously-, and philosophically-motivated art, to create a sense of [[beauty]] (see ''[[aesthetics]]'' and ''[[fine art]]'') or pleasure, or to generate strong [[emotion]]s; the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

As a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression, art may be defined by the pursuit of [[diversity]] and the usage of [[narrative]]s of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries. This distinction may be applied to objects or performances, current or historical, and its prestige extends to those who made, found, exhibit, or own them. Other than originality, there are no widely agreed-upon criteria for what is or isn't considered &quot;art&quot;, and there are many divergent definitions of ''art'' to seek more specific requirements.

==Etymology==
The word ''art'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', which roughly translates to &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft&quot;, and derives in turn from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] meaning &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange&quot;. This is the only near-universal definition of art: that whatever is described as such has undergone a deliberate process of arrangement by an agent. A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include [[artifact]], artificial, artifice, [[artillery]], [[Medicine|medical]] arts, and [[military]] arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology|etymological]] roots.

==Art forms==
There are a variety of arts, including visual arts and design, [[decorative art]]s, [[plastic arts]], and the [[performing arts]]. Artistic expression takes many forms: [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[literature]], and [[architecture]] are the most widely recognised forms. However, since the advent of [[modernism]] and the technological revolution, new forms have emerged. These include [[photography]], [[film]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[conceptual art]], [[performance art]], [[community arts]], [[land art]], [[fashion]], [[comics]], [[computer art]], [[anime]], and, most recently, [[video game theory|video games]].

Within each form, a wide range of [[genre]]s may exist. For instance, a painting may be a [[still life]], a [[portrait]], or a [[Landscape art|landscape]] and may deal with [[History painting|historical]] or domestic subjects. In addition, a [[work (fine arts)|work of art]] may be representational or abstract.

Most forms of art fit under two main categories: [[fine arts]] and [[applied art]]s, though there is no clear dividing line. In the visual arts, the term ''fine arts'' most often refers to painting and sculpture, arts which have little or no practical function and are valued in terms of the visual pleasure they provide or their success in communicating ideas or feelings. Other visual arts typically designated as fine arts include printmaking, drawing, photography, film, and video, though the tools used to realize these media are often used to make applied or commercial art as well. Architecture typically confounds the distinctions between fine and applied art, since the form involves designing structures that strive to be both attractive and functional. The term ''applied arts'' is most often used to describe the design or decoration of functional objects to make them visually pleasing. Artists who create applied arts or crafts are usually referred to as [[design]]ers, [[artisan]]s, or craftspeople.

==Defining art==
There is often confusion about the meaning of the term ''art'' because multiple meanings of the word are used interchangeably. Individuals use the word ''art'' to identify painting, as well as singing.

===Characteristics of art===
There follow some generally accepted characteristics of art; after this there is some lengthier discussion of several of those facets perceived as universal or central to art:

* encourages an intuitive understanding rather than a rational understanding, as, for example, with an article in a scientific journal;
* was created with the intention of evoking such an understanding, or an attempt at such an understanding, in the audience;
* was created with no other purpose or function other than to be itself (a radical, &quot;pure art&quot; definition);
* elusive, in that the work may communicate on many different levels of appreciation; one may take the example of [[Gericault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'', in the case of which special knowledge concerning the shipwreck the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it, but allows the appreciation of Gericault's political intentions in the piece;
* in relation to the above, the piece may offer itself to many different interpretations, or, though it superficially depicts a mundane event or object, invites reflection upon elevated themes;
* demonstrates a high level of ability or fluency within a medium; this characteristic might be considered a point of contention, since many modern artists (most notably, conceptual artists) do not themselves create the works they conceive, or do not even create the work in a conventional, demonstrative sense (one might think of [[Tracey Emin]]'s controversial ''My Bed'');
* the conferral of a particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structure or form upon an original set of unrelated, passive constituents.

===Skill===
Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Recording medium|medium]].  An example of this is the contemporary young master Josignacio, creator of [[Plastic Paint Medium]]. It can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] so as to convey meaning, with immediacy and or depth.

A common view is that the epithet 'art' (particular in its elevated sense) requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability (such as one might find in many works of the [[Rennaissance]] or in the plays of [[Shakespeare]]) or an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two.

For example, a common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art|modern]] painting occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object.  One might take [[Tracey Emin|Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'' or [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'', as examples of pieces wherein the artist exercised little to no traditionally recognised sets of skills. In the first case, Emin simply slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery. She has, however, been insistent that there is a high degree of selection and arrangement in this work, which includes objects such as underwear and bottles around the bed. In the second case, Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork. Although he physically particpated in the creation of this piece, he has left the eventual creation of many other works to employed artisans. These approaches are exemplary of a particular kind of contemporary art: [[conceptual art]].

The exclusionary view that art requires a certain skill level to produce is often described as a [[lay critique]]. It derives from the fact that in [[Western culture]] at least, art has traditionally been pushed in the direction of [[representation (arts)|representationalism]], the literal presentation of reality through literal images.  On the other hand, criticism has often been brought to bear on modern artists for having no creative involvement whatsoever in their creations: one might take Hirst's work again as emblematic of this approach.  It may be further noted that certain forms of art outside a Western tradition, such as [[Islamic]] geometric designs and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Buddhist]] or [[Hindu]] [[mandalas]] and [[Celtic knotwork]], though they are non-representational, still require a measure of skill and certain creative involvement in their execution.

===Judgments of value===
Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as &quot;that meal was a work of art&quot; (the cook is an artist), or &quot;the art of deception,&quot; (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.

Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism: at the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'', whether it is perceived to be attractive or repellent. Though perception is always colored by experience, and thus a reaction to art on these grounds is necessarily subjective, it is commonly taken that that which is not aesthetically satisfying in some fashion cannot be art.  However, &quot;good&quot; art is not always, or even regularly, aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic, and art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons; for example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of [[3rd of May]] [[1808]] is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians, yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution, and his fitting social and political outrage.  Thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of that which is aesthetically appealing.  Indeed, the reverse is often true, that in the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself.  Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium in order to strike some universal chord, or by the rarity of the skill of the artist, or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''.

===Communicating emotion===
Art appeals to human emotions. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. [[artist|Artists]] have to express themselves so that their public is aroused, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art explores what is commonly termed as ''[[human condition|the human condition]]''; that is, essentially, what it is to be human, and art of a superior kind often brings about some new insight concerning humanity (not always positive) or demonstrates a level of skill so fine as to push forward the boundaries of collective human ability.

This is not to say that technical skill is a necessary prerequisite of art, but rather that a high degree of skill goes some way in conferring a judgement of high standard upon an artist or artwork.

===Creative impulse===
From one [[point of view|perspective]], art is a generic term for any product of the [[creative impulse]], out of which sprang all other human pursuits &amp;mdash; such as [[science]] via [[alchemy]], and [[religion]] via [[shamanism]]. The term 'art' offers no true definition besides those based within the cultural, historical and geographical context in which it is applied. Though to the artists themselves, the impulse to create is undeniable; an artist can no more deny that impulse than he/she could ignore breathing (one might compare [[Kandinsky]]'s [[inner necessity]] to this popular view). It is because of the overbearing need to create, in the face of financial ruin, public obscurity or political opposition, that artists are typically conceived of as unstable, even crazy, or misguided.

==Differences in defining art==
Definitions of art and [[aesthetic]] arguments usually proceed from one of several possible perspectives. Art may be defined by the intention of the artist as in the writings of [[John Dewey|Dewey]]. Art may be seen as being in the response/emotion of the viewer as [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] claims. In [[Arthur Danto|Danto]]'s view, it can be defined as a character of the item itself or as a function of an object's context.

===Plato===
For [[Plato]], art is a pursuit whose adherents are not to be trusted; given that their productions imitate the sensory world (itself an imitation of the divine world of forms) art necessarily is an imitation of an imitation, and thus is hopelessly far from the source of the truth.  Plato, it may be noted, barred artists from access to his ideal city, in his [[Republic]].

===Aristotle===
Aristotle saw art in less of a bad light; though he shared Plato's poor opinion of it, he nevertheless thought that art might serve the purpose of emotional catharsis.  That is, by witnessing the sufferings and celebrations of actors onstage onlookers might vicariously experience these same feelings themselves, and thereby purge such negative feelings.

===Institutional definition===
Many people's opinions of what art is would fall inside a relatively small range of accepted standards, or &quot;institutional definition of art&quot; ([[George Dickie]] 1974). This derives from education and other social factors. Most people did not consider the depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] or a store-bought [[urinal]] to be art until [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art (Although, strictly speaking, Warhol's artwork was not an actual Brillo box but an ''exact replica'' of one - so it met the traditional criterion of skill at the very least).

Most viewers of these objects initially rejected such associations, because the objects did not, themselves, meet the accepted criteria. The objects needed to be absorbed into the general consensus of what art is before they achieved the near-universal acceptance as art in the contemporary era. Once accepted and viewed with a fresh eye, the smooth, white surfaces of Duchamp's urinal are strikingly similar to classical marble sculptural forms, whether the artist intended it or not. This type of recontextualizing provides the same spark of connection expected from any traditionally created art.  It should be noted, however, that Duchamps act might be as readily interpreted as a demonstration of the (not always beneficial) power of artistic institutions, rather than the universal art potentially inherent in all objects.

The placement of an object in an artistic context is not taken as a universal standard of art, but is a common characteristic of [[conceptual art]], prevalent since the 1960s; notably, the [[Stuckist]] art movement criticises this tendency of recent art.

==Related issues==
===Social criticism===
Art is often seen as belonging to one social class and excluding others. In this context, art is seen as a high-status activity associated with wealth, the ability to purchase art, and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it. The [[Palace of Versailles|palaces of Versailles]] or the [[Hermitage]] in [[St. Petersburg]] with their vast collections of art, amassed by the fabulously wealthy royalty of Europe exemplify this view. Collecting such art is the preserve of the rich, in one viewpoint.

Before the [[13th century]] in [[Europe]], artisans were considered to belong to a lower [[caste]], since they were essentially manual labourers. After Europe was re-exposed to [[Renaissance Classicism|classical culture]] during the [[Renaissance]], particularly in the [[nation-state]]s of what is now Italy ([[Florence]], [[Siena]]), artists gained an association with high status. However, arrangements of &quot;fine&quot; and expensive goods have always been used by institutions of power as marks of their own status. This is seen in the 20th and [[21st century]] by the commissioning or purchasing of art by big businesses and corporations as decoration for their offices.

===Utility===
There are many who ascribe to certain arts the quality of being non-[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]]. This fits within the &quot;art as good&quot; system of definitions and suffers from a class prejudice against labor and utility. Opponents of this view argue that all human activity has some utilitarian function, and these objects claimed to be &quot;non-utilitarian&quot; actually have the rather mundane and banal utility of attempting to mystify and codify unworkable justifications for arbitrary social hierarchy.  It might also be argued that non-utilitarian is, in this context, a mis-usage; that art is not in and of itself, useless, but rather that it particularly use does not manifest itself in any traditionally demonstrable way (though advances in neuroscience may arguably enable the isolation of those associated cortices of the brain concerned with the creation or appreciation of art).

Art is also used by art therapists and some psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The end product is not the principal goal in this case; rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought.  The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.

The &quot;use&quot; of art from the artist‚Äôs standpoint is as a means of expression. When art is conceived as a device, it serves several context and perspective specific functions. From the artist‚Äôs perspective it allows one to symbolize complex ideas and emotions in an arbitrary language subject only to the interpretation of the self and peers.

In a social context, it can serve to soothe the soul and promote popular morale.  In a more negative aspect of this facet, art is often utilised as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood (in some cases, artworks are appropriated to be used in this manner, without the creator's initial intention).

From a more anthropological perspective, art is a way of passing ideas and concepts on to later generations in a (somewhat) universal language. The interpretation of this language is very dependent upon the observer‚Äôs perspective and context, and it might be argued that the very subjectivity of art demonstrates its importance in providing an arena in which rival ideas might be exchanged and discussed, or to provide a social context in which disparate groups of people might congregate and mingle.

===History of art===
{{main|History of Art}}

The term '[[art history]]' typically refers to a historical examination of the various trends of the visual arts through certain periods of human history.  It may also be taken to encompass a study of the theories of art, which may or may not include an examination of their historical context.

===Symbols===
{{main|Symbols}}

Much of the development of individual artist deals with finding principles for how to express certain ideas through various kinds of [[symbolism]]. For example, [[Vasily Kandinsky]] developed his use of [[color]] in [[painting]] through a system of stimulus response, where over time he gained an understanding of the [[emotions]] that can be evoked by color and combinations of color. Contemporary artist [[Andy Goldsworthy]], on the other hand, chose to use the [[medium]] of found natural objects and materials to arrange temporary sculptures.

==Cultural differences of art==
Several genres of art are grouped by cultural relevance, examples can be found in terms such as:

*[[African art]]
*[[American craft]]
*[[Islamic art]]
*[[Asian art]] as found in:
**[[Buddhist art]]
**[[Chinese art]]
**[[Art and architecture of Japan|Japanese art]]
**[[Tibetan art]]
**[[Thai art]]
**[[Laotian art]]
*[[Visual arts of the United States]]
*[[Latin American art]]

[[Image:ActorsOffSetLaughing.jpg|thumb|right|Actors in period costume sharing a joke whilst waiting between takes during location filming.]]
An '''actor''' is a person who [[acting|acts]], or plays a role, in an artistic production. The term commonly refers to someone working in [[film|movies]], [[television]], live [[Theater|theatre]], or [[radio programming|radio]], and can occasionally denote a street entertainer. Besides playing dramatic roles, actors may also sing or dance or work only on radio or as a [[voice artist]]. A [[female]] actor may be known as an '''actress''', although the term &quot;actor&quot;, is also used as a gender-neutral term.

An actor usually plays a [[fictional character]]. In the case of a true story (or a fictional story that portrays real people) an actor may play a real person (or a fictional version of the same).  Occasionally, actors appear as themselves.
==Etymology==
&quot;Actor&quot; is directly from the masculine [[Latin]] noun ''actor'' (feminine, ''actrix'') from the [[Latin verbs|verb]] ''agere'' &quot;'''to do''', to drive, to pass time&quot; + the suffix ''-or'' &quot;so./st. who performs the action indicated by the stem&quot;. Alternatively from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|·ºÇŒ∫œÑœâœÅ}} ''(aktor)'', leader, from the [[verb]] {{polytonic|·ºÇŒ≥œâ}} ''(ag≈ç)'', to lead or carry, to convey, to bring.

==History==
The first recorded case of an actor performing took place in [[530s BC|534 BC]] (probably on [[23 November]], though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped on to the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' and became the first person to speak words as a character in a play. The machinations of storytelling were immediately revolutionized. Prior to Thespis' act, stories were told in [[song]] and dance and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative, but no one had assumed the role of a character in a story. In honour of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. Theatrical [[Mythology|myth]] to this day maintains that Thespis exists as a mischievous spirit, and disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his ghostly intervention.

Actors were traditionally not people of high status, and in the [[Early Middle Ages]] travelling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. However, this negative perception dramaticaly changed in 20th Century as acting became an honored and popular profession and art. Part of the reason is due to the rise of the popular appeal and access to dramatic [[film]] entertainment and the resulting rise of the [[movie star]] in social status and the large salaries they commanded.  The combination of public presence and wealth had a profound rehabilitation to the image.

In the past, only men could become actors.  In the ancient and [[middle ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage, and this belief continued right up until the 17th century, when in [[Venice]] it was broken.  In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were played by men or boys, though there is some evidence to suggest that women disguised as men also (illegally) performed.

==Actors playing the opposite sex==
Women sometimes play the roles of [[prepubescent]] boys, because in some regards a woman has a closer resemblance to a boy than does a man. The role of [[Peter Pan]], for example, is traditionally played by a woman. The tradition of the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]] may be compared. An adult playing a child occurs more in theater than in film. The exception to this is voice actors in [[animated]] films, where boys are generally voiced by women, as heard in ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  [[Opera]] has several '[[pants role]]s' traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s.  Examples are Hansel in ''[[H√§nsel und Gretel]]'', and [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

[[Mary Pickford]] played the part of [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] in the first film version of the book. [[Linda Hunt]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', in which she played the part of a man.  

Having an actor play the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long standing tradition in comic theatre and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of cross dressing, and both [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] appeared in hit comedy films where they were required to play most scenes dressed as women. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.

==Techniques of acting==
Actors employ a variety of techniques that are learned through training and experience. Some of these are:

#The rigorous use of the voice to communicate a character's lines and express emotion. This is achieved through attention to diction and projection through correct breathing and articulation. It is also achieved through the tone and emphasis that an actor puts on words
#Physicalisation of a role in order to create a believable character for the audience and to use the acting space appropriately and correctly
#Use of gesture to complement the voice, interact with other actors and to bring emphasis to the words in a play, as well as having symbolic meaning

[[Shakespeare]] is believed to have been commenting on the acting style and techniques of his era when [[Hamlet]] gives his famous advice to the players:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance: o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Agnostida''' (the '''agnostids''') is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[trilobite]]. These small trilobites first appeared toward the end of the lower [[Cambrian]] and thrived in the middle Cambrian. The last agnostids held out until the late [[Ordovician]]. 

The Agnostida are divided into two suborders -- [[Agnostina]] and [[Eodiscina]] -- that are then divided into a number of [[family (biology)|families]]. The Eodiscina appear to be &quot;normal&quot; trilobites with only two or three segments in the thorax; some resemble trilobites of the order [[Ptychopariida]]. As a group, agnostids have ''[[Pygidium|pygidia]]'' (tails) that are similar in size and shape to their ''[[cephalon]]s'' (heads). Neither looks much like the corresponding regions of other trilobites. There has been more than one argument about which end is the &quot;head&quot;. 

Agnostids were probably benthic (bottom-dwelling) creatures. Most agnostid species have no eyes. They likely lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom.

Unfortunately, the appendages are known only for one [[genus]] of agnostid. The legs of that genus look much more like [[crustacean]] legs than the legs of other trilobites with preserved appendages. This has caused many [[Taxonomy|taxonomist]]s to question whether the agnostids are truly trilobites. Another view is that the agnostids represent the first line to have diverged from the trilobites. However, four orders of trilobites ([[Redlichiida]], [[Corynexochida]], [[Naraoidia]], [[Ptychopariida]]) considerably predate the earliest Agnostids in the [[fossil]] record.

Agnostina are generally referred to simply as &quot;agnostids&quot; even though they probably should be called &quot;agnostines&quot;.

An '''abortion''' is the termination of a [[pregnancy]] associated with the death of an [[embryo]] or a [[fetus]]. This can occur spontaneously, in the form of a [[miscarriage]], or be intentionally induced through chemical, surgical, or other means. Generally, abortions are performed by [[gynaecology|gynaecologists]] or [[obstetrics|obstetricians]]. All [[Pregnancy (mammals)|mammalian pregnancies]] can be aborted; however, this article focuses exclusively on the abortion of [[human]] pregnancy.

There have been various methods of inducing an abortion [[History of abortion|throughout the centuries]]. In the [[20th century]], the [[ethics]] and [[morality]] of abortion became the subject of intense [[political]] [[debate]] in many areas of the world.

==Definitions==
[[Pregnancy]] is defined by the [[medicine|medical community]] as beginning at the [[implantation]] of the [[embryo]]. Others differ, however, placing this initiation at [[fertilisation|conception]]. The following medical terms are used to define an abortion:

* ''Spontaneous abortion ([[miscarriage]])'': An abortion due to accidental trauma or [[natural causes]].
*''Induced abortion'': An abortion deliberately caused. Induced abortions are further subcategorized into therapeutic abortions and elective abortions: 
**''Therapeutic abortion''
*** To save the life of the pregnant woman.  	 
*** To preserve the woman's physical or mental health. 	 
*** To terminate a pregnancy that would result in the birth of a child with defects which would be [[fatal|incompatible with life]] or associated with significant [[morbidity]]. 	 
*** To [[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of [[fetus]]es in a [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]] to lessen health risks involved. 	 
**''Elective abortion'': An abortion performed for any other reason.

Methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as [[emergency contraception]], are not considered to be abortion; however, emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who reject the medical definition of pregnancy.

A pregnancy that ends earlier than 37 completed weeks of gestation, and where an [[infant]] is born and survives, is termed a [[premature birth]]. A pregnancy that ends with an infant dead upon birth at any gestational stage, due to causes including spontaneous abortion or complications during delivery, is termed a [[stillbirth]]. 

In common parlance, the term &quot;abortion&quot; is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus.

==Incidence==
The incidence of and reasons for induced abortion vary in regions in which abortion is generally permitted.

It has been estimated that the total number of induced abortions performed globally is approximately 46 million per year. 26 million of these are said to occur in [[abortion law|places in which abortion is legal]]; the other 20 million happen where it is illegal. Some countries, such as [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], experience a low rate of induced abortion, while others like [[Russia]] and [[Vietnam]] have a comparatively high rate. {{ref|incidence2}} 

A 1998 study aggregated data from studies in 27 countries on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies. It concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were the desire to delay or end childbearing, concern over the interruption of [[employment|work]] or [[education]], issues of financial or relationship stability, and perceived immaturity. {{ref|incidence3}} In [[Finland]] and the  [[United States]], concern for the health risks posed by pregnancy in individual cases was not a factor commonly given, whereas in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and [[Kenya]] such a concern was found to be more prevalent. A 2004 study in which  [[United States|American]] women at [[abortion clinic|clinic]]s answered a [[questionnaire]] yielded similar results. {{ref|incidence4}}  

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures, such as [[eugenics]], the stigmatization of [[disabled]] persons, preference for children of a specific [[sex]], disapproval of [[single parent|single motherhood]], insufficient economic support for [[family|families]], lack of access to or rejection of [[birth control|contraceptive]] methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as [[China]]'s [[one-child policy]]). A combination of these factors can sometimes result in forced abortion, [[forced sterilization]], [[infanticide]], [[child abandonment]], or [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide]] ‚Äî which is illegal in most countries, but difficult to stop. In many areas, especially in [[developing country|developing nations]] or where abortion is illegal, women sometimes resort to &quot;[[back-alley abortion|back-alley]]&quot; or [[self-induced abortion|self-induced]] procedures. The [[World Health Organization]] suggests that there are 19 million terminations annually which fit its criteria for an [[Abortion#Unsafe abortion|unsafe abortion]]. {{ref|unsafe1}} See [[Abortion#Social issues|social issues]] for more information on these subjects.

==Forms of abortion==

===Spontaneous abortion===
{{main|Miscarriage}}

&lt;!--improve me!--&gt;
Spontaneous abortions, generally referred to as miscarriages, occur when an embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes. A miscarriage is spontaneous loss of the embryo or fetus before the 20th week of development. Spontaneous abortions after the 20th week are generally considered to be preterm deliveries. Most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy. Approximately 10-50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman. {{ref|miscarriage1}}

The risk for spontaneous abortion is greater in those with a history of more than three previous (known) spontaneous abortions, those who have had a previous induced abortion, those with systemic diseases, and in women over age 35.  

Other causes can be infection (of either the woman or the fetus), immune responses, or serious systemic diseases of the woman. 

A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental [[trauma]]; intentional trauma to cause miscarriage is considered an induced abortion. Some governments have laws increasing the criminal liability of a person who causes a miscarriage during an [[assault]] or other violent [[crime]].

===Induced abortion===

A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in a number of ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the [[gestational age]] of the [[fetus]], in addition to the legality, regional availability, and/or doctor-patient preference for specific procedures.

====Surgical abortion====
[[Image:PBAsigning_wide.jpg|thumb|240px|right|U.S. President George W. Bush signs the ''Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003'']]

In the first fifteen weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method. ''[[Manual vacuum aspiration]]'', or MVA abortion, consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] by suction using a manual [[syringe]], while the ''[[Electric vacuum aspiration]]'' or EVA abortion method uses an electric [[pump]]. These techniques are equivalent, differing only in the mechanism use to apply suction.  From the fifteenth week up until around the twenty-sixth week, a surgical [[dilation and evacuation]] (D &amp;amp; E) is used. D &amp;amp; E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D &amp;amp; C) is a standard gynaecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion.  ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to the cleaning of the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this sort of procedure, also called Sharp Curettage, only when MVA is unavailable. {{ref|surgicalabortion1}} Sharp curettage only accounted for 2.4% of abortion procedures in the US in [[2002]]. {{ref|surgicalabortion2}} The term &quot;D and C&quot; can more generally be used to refer to the first trimester abortion procedure, irrespective of the method used to perform the procedure. 

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the third [[trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with caustic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. Very late abortions can be brought about by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (intact D &amp;amp; X), which requires the surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation, and is sometimes termed &quot;[[partial-birth abortion]].&quot;  A [[hysterotomy abortion]], similar to a [[caesarian section]] but resulting in a terminated fetus, can also be used at late stages of pregnancy. It can be performed vaginally, with an incision just above the [[cervix]], in the late mid-trimester.

====Chemical abortion====
[[Image:Mifepristone.gif|thumb|right|170px|The molecular structure of the abortifacient drug Mifepristone.]]
{{main|Chemical abortion}}

Effective in the first trimester of pregnancy, chemical (also referred to as a medical abortion), or non-surgical abortions comprise 10% of all abortions in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. The process begins with the administration of either [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by [[misoprostol]]. When appropriately used, 98% of women undergoing medical termination of pregnancy will experience completed abortion without surgical intervention. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] currently approves the use of mifepristone up to 49 days gestation (7 weeks), though evidence based regimens exist for its use up to 61 days gestation with similar success rates.  Misoprostol alone can also be used, though it is not FDA approved for this purpose.  Misoprostol (Cytotec) alone has the advantage of costing less than one dollar for an effective dose, as opposed to several hundred dollars for an effective dose of mifepristone.  In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

====Other means of abortion====
Historically, a number of [[herb]]s reputed to possess [[abortifacient]] properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]: [[tansy]], [[pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]] (see [[Abortion#History of abortion|history of abortion]]). The use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious ‚Äî even lethal ‚Äî side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]], and is not recommended by [[physician]]s. {{ref|othermethods1}}

Abortion is sometimes attempted through means of trauma to the [[abdomen]]. The degree of force applied, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing [[miscarriage]]. {{ref|othermethods2}} Both accidental and deliberate abortions of this kind can be subject to criminal liability in many countries. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Thailand]], there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal [[massage]]. {{ref|othermethods3}}

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include the misuse of the [[ulcer]] [[drug]] [[Misoprostol]] and the insertion of non-surgical implements such as [[knitting needle]]s and [[clothes hanger]]s into the [[uterus]].

==Health effects==

&lt;!--MAJOR REORG NEEDED. Entire section is argumentative, and biased: See Talk. --&gt;
Early-term surgical abortion is a simple procedure, and when performed by competent doctors (and in some states, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants) in first-world nations (before the 16th week), is safer than carrying the pregnancy to term. {{ref|healtheffects1}} &lt;!-- As I pointed out earlier, listing the negatives of this generally safe procedure first would be biased. --&gt;

As with most surgical procedures, the most common surgical abortion methods carry the risk of potentially serious complications. These risks include: a perforated uterus, perforated [[bowel]] or [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], [[septic shock]], sterility, and death. The risk of complications occurring can increase depending on how far the pregnancy has progressed, but may be counterbalanced by [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]] that would occur from carrying the pregnancy to term.

It is difficult to accurately assess the risks of induced abortion due to a number of factors. These factors include wide variation in the quality of abortion services in different [[Society|societies]] and among different [[socio-economic]] groups, a lack of uniform [[definition]]s of terms, and difficulties in patient follow-up and after-care. The degree of risk is also dependent upon the skill and experience of the practitioner; maternal age, health, and [[parity]]; [[gestational age]]; pre-existing conditions; methods and instruments used; [[medication]]s used; the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner; and the quality of recovery and follow-up care. A highly-skilled practitioner, operating under ideal conditions, will tend to have a very low rate of complications; an inexperienced practitioner in an ill-equipped and ill-staffed facility, on the other hand, will often have a higher incidence of complications.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the number of deaths due to legal abortion between the years of 1991 and 1993 was 5, as compared to the 9 deaths caused by [[ectopic pregnancy]] during the same time frame. {{ref|mortality1}} In the [[United States]], during the year 1999, there were a total of 4 deaths due to legal abortion. {{ref|mortality2}} &lt;!--need to compare the number of abortions and the number of pregnancies for these numbers to relate --&gt;

Some practitioners advocate using minimal [[anesthesia]] so that the patient can alert them to possible complications. Others recommend [[general anesthesia]], in order to prevent patient movement, which might cause a perforation. General anesthesia carries its own risks, including death, which is why public health officials recommend against its routine use.

[[Dilation]] of the [[cervix]] carries the risk of cervical tears or perforations, including small tears that might not be apparent and might cause [[cervical incompetence]] in future pregnancies. Most practitioners recommend using the smallest possible dilators, and using [[osmotic]] rather than [[mechanical]] dilators after the first [[trimester]] of pregnancy. 

Instruments are placed within the uterus to remove the fetus. These can, on rare occasions, cause [[perforation]] or [[laceration]] of the uterus, and damage to structures surrounding the uterus. Laceration or perforation of the uterus or cervix can, again on rare occasions, lead to even more serious complications.

Incomplete emptying of the uterus can cause [[hemorrhage]] and infection. Use of [[ultrasound]] verification of the location and duration of the pregnancy prior to abortion, with immediate follow-up of patients reporting continuing pregnancy symptoms after the procedure, will virtually eliminate this risk. The sooner a complication is noted and properly treated, the lower the risk of permanent injury or death. 

In rare cases, the abortion will be unsuccessful and the pregnancy will continue. An unsuccessful abortion can also result in the delivery of a live [[neonate]], or infant. This, termed a failed abortion, is more likely to occur if the procedure is carried out later in the pregnancy. Some doctors faced with this situation have voiced concerns about the ethical and legal ramifications of then letting the neonate die. As a result, recent investigations have been launched in the [[United Kingdom]] by the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in order to determine how widespread the problem is and what an ethical response in the treatment of the infant might be. {{ref|failed}}

Use of other methods (e.g., overdose of various drugs, insertion of various objects into [[uterus]]) for abortion is potentially dangerous, carrying a significantly elevated risk for permanent injury or death compared to abortions done by [[physician]]s. 

===Suggested effects===
There is controversy over a number of proposed risks and effects of abortion. Evidence, whether in support of or against such claims, might in part be influenced by the political and religious beliefs of the parties behind it.

====Breast cancer====
{{main|Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis}}

The ''abortion-breast cancer (ABC) hypothesis'' posits a [[causality| causal relationship]] between having an induced abortion and a higher risk of developing [[breast cancer]] in the future. An increased level of [[estrogen]] in early [[pregnancy]] helps to initiate [[cellular differentiation]] (growth) in the [[breast]] in preparation for [[lactation]]. If this process is terminated, through abortion, before full differentiation in the third [[trimester]], then more &quot;vulnerable&quot; undifferentiated cells will be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. It is proposed that this might result in an elevated risk of [[breast cancer]]. The majority of interview-based studies have indicated a link, and some have been demonstrated to be [[statistically significant]], {{ref|abc1}} but there remains debate as to their reliability because of possible [[response bias]].

Larger and more recent record-based studies, such as one in 1997 which used data from two national [[registry|registries]] in [[Denmark]], found the correlation to be negligible to non-existent after statistical adjustment. {{ref|abc2}} The [[National Cancer Institute]] conducted an official workshop with dozens of experts on the issue, between [[February 24]]-[[February 26]], [[2003]], which concluded from its examination of various evidence that it is &quot;well established&quot; that &quot;induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.&quot; {{ref|abc3}}  These findings and how the Denmark study statistically adjusted their overall results have been disputed by [[Joel Brind|Dr. Joel Brind]], {{ref|abc4}} an invitee to the workshop and the leading scientific advocate of the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis. Nevertheless, gaps and inconsistencies remain in the research, and the subject continues to be one of political and scientific contention.

====Fetal pain====
{{main|Fetal pain}}

The experience of the fetus during abortion is a matter of medical, ethical and public policy concern.  Evidence is conflicting, with some authorities holding that the fetus is capable of feeling pain from the first [[trimester]], and others maintaining that the neuro-anatomical requirements for such experience do not exist until the second or third trimester.

[[Pain|Pain receptors]] begin to appear in the seventh week of pregnancy. The [[thalamus]], the part of the brain which receives signals from the [[nervous system]] and then relays them to the [[cerebral cortex]], starts to form in the fifth week. However, other anatomical structures involved in the [[pain|nociceptic]] process are not present until much later in gestation. Links between the thalamus and cerebral cortex aren't forged until around the 23rd week. {{ref|pain1}}

Researchers have observed changes in the heart rates and [[hormones| hormonal levels]] of newborn [[infants]] after [[circumcision]], [[blood tests]], and surgery ‚Äî effects which were alleviated with the administration of [[anesthesia]]. {{ref|pain2}} Others suggest that the human experience of pain, being more than just physiological, cannot be measured in such [[reflexive]] responses.

====Mental health====
Some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion. However, whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis, or even classification as an independent syndrome (see [[post-abortion syndrome]]), is a subject that is debated among members of the medical community.

Data on the incidence of [[clinical depression]], [[mental illness]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and suicide in association with abortion remain inconclusive. {{ref|mental1}} A comparative analysis of the suicide rates among [[postnatal| postpartum]] and post-abortive women in [[Finland]] found a [[statistics| statistical]] correlation between abortion and suicide. {{ref|mental2}}

Other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted [[pregnancy]] and an improvement in reported mental well-being. {{ref|mental3}} Elective abortion may reduce the occurrence of depression in cases of unwanted pregnancy, as compared to cases in which the pregnancy has been carried to completion, but it is also sometimes reported as an additional [[stressor]] ([[ibid.]]). The majority of evidence would seem to indicate that adverse emotional reactions to the procedure are most strongly influenced by pre-existing [[psychology| psychological]] conditions and other negative factors ([[ibid.]]). 

Spontaneous abortion, or [[miscarriage]], is known to present an increased risk of [[depression]] in women. {{ref|mental4}}

==History of abortion==
{{main|History of abortion}}

[[Image:TansyPills.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Bottom-most: &quot;Dr. Caton's Tansy Pills!&quot; An example of a clandestine  advertisement.]]

The practice of induced abortion, according to some [[anthropologists]], can be traced to ancient times. There is evidence to suggest that, historically, pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of [[abortifacient]] herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.

[[Soranus]], a 2nd century [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[physician]], suggested in his work ''[[Gynecology]]'' that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals. He also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal bathes, [[pessary| pessaries]], and [[bloodletting]], but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ [[perforation]]. {{ref|history1}} It is also known that the ancient Greeks relied upon the herb [[silphium]] as both a [[contraceptive]] and an [[abortifacient]]. The plant, as the chief export of [[Cyrene]], was driven to [[extinction]], but it is suggested that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the [[Apiaceae|Apiaceae family]].

Such folk remedies, however, varied in effectiveness and were not without risk. [[Tansy]] and [[pennyroyal]], for example, are two [[poison|poisonous]] [[herbs]] with serious [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy.

[[19th-century]] [[medicine]] saw advances in the fields of [[surgery]], [[anaesthesia]], and [[sanitation]], in the same era that doctors with the [[American Medical Association]] lobbied for bans on abortion in [[The United States]] and the [[British Parliament]] passed the Offences Against the Person Act. Demand for the procedure continued, however, as the disguised, but nonetheless open, advertisement of abortion services in Victorian times would seem to suggest. {{ref|history2}}

==Social issues==
A number of of complex issues exist in the debate over abortion. These, like the suggested effects upon health listed above, are a focus of research and a fixture of discussion among members on all sides the controversy.

===Effect upon crime rate===
{{Main|legalized abortion and crime effect}}

A controversial theory attempts to draw a [[correlation]] between the unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall [[crime rate]] witnessed in the [[United States]] during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 [[academic paper]], ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the [[economist]]s [[Steven Levitt| Steven D. Levitt]] and [[John Donohue]]. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are [[African-American]], [[poverty| impoverished]], [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], [[education|uneducated]], and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would've been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier and that those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions. {{ref|crimerate1}} 

Fellow economists [[Christopher Foote]] and [[Christopher Goetz]] criticized the [[methodology]] in the Donahue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as [[cocaine]] use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime [[per capita]]; they found no [[statistically significant|statistically significant]] results. {{ref|crimerate2}} Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted [[data set]] which took into account these concerns but, they claim, maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper. {{ref|crimerate3}}

Such research has been criticized by some as being [[utilitarian]], [[discrimination|discriminatory]] as to [[race]] and [[social class|socioeconomic class]], and as promoting [[eugenic]]s as a solution to [[crime]]. {{ref|crimerate4}} {{ref|crimerate5}} Levitt states in his book, ''[[Freakonomics]]'', that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action &amp;ndash; merely reporting data as economists.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|sex-selective abortion and infanticide}}

The advent of both [[ultrasound]] and [[amniocentesis]] has allowed [[parent]]s to determine [[sex]] before [[childbirth|birth]]. This has lead to the occurrence of [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortion]] or the targeted termination of a [[fetus]] based upon its gender.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the [[birth rate]]s of [[male]] and [[female]] children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of [[Asia]], and the use of abortion to limit female births has been reported in [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], and [[India]]. {{ref|sexselective1}}

In [[India]], the [[economic]] role of [[men]], the costs associated with [[dowry| dowries]], and a [[Hindu]] tradition which dictates that [[funeral|funeral rites]] must be performed by a male relative have lead to a [[culture| cultural]] preference for [[son]]s. {{ref|sexselective2}}  The widespread availability of diagnostic testing, during the 1970s and '80s, lead to advertisements for services which read, &quot;Invest 500 [[rupee]]s [for a sex test] now, save 50,000 rupees [for a dowry] later.&quot; {{ref|sexselective3}} In 1991, the male-to-female [[sex ratio]] in India was skewed from its biological norm of 105 to 100, to an average of 108 to 100. {{ref|sexselective4}} Researchers have asserted that between 1985 and 2005 as many as 10 million female fetuses may have been selectively aborted. {{ref|india1}} The Indian government passed an official ban of pre-natal sex screening in 1994 and moved to pass a complete ban of sex-selective abortion in 2002. {{ref|sexselective5}}

In the [[People's Republic of China]], there is also a historic son preference. The implementation of the [[one-child policy]] in 1979, in response to population concerns, lead to an increased disparities in the sex ratio as parents attempted to circumvent the law through sex-selective abortion or the abandonment of unwanted [[daughter]]s. {{ref|sexselective6}} Sex-selective abortion might be a part of what is behind the shift from the baseline male-to-female birth rate to an elevated national rate of 117:100 reported in 2002.  The trend was more pronounced in rural regions: as high as 130:100 in [[Guangdong]] and 135:100 in [[Hainan]]. {{ref|sexselective7}} A ban upon the practice of sex-selective abortion was enacted in 2003. {{ref|sexselective8}}

===Unsafe abortion===
{{main|Unsafe abortions}}

Where and when access to safe abortion has been barred, due to explicit sanctions or general unavailability, women seeking to terminate their pregnancies have sometimes resorted to unsafe methods.

&quot;[[Back-alley abortion]]&quot; is a [[slang]] term for any abortion not practiced under ideal conditions of [[sanitation]] and [[professional| professionalism]]. The [[World Health Organization]] defines an unsafe abortion as being, &quot;a procedure...carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.&quot; {{ref|unsafe1}} This can include a person without medical training, a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions, or the woman herself. 

Unsafe abortion remains a [[public health]] concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], [[hemorrhage]], and damage to internal organs. WHO estimates that 19 million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that 68,000 of these result in the death of a woman. {{ref|unsafe1}} Complications of unsafe abortion are said to account, globally, for approximately 13% of all [[maternal death|maternal mortalities]], with regional estimates including 12% in [[Asia]], 25% in [[Latin America]], and 13% in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. {{ref|unsafe2}} [[Health education]], access to [[family planning]], and improvements in [[healthcare]] during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon. {{ref|unsafe3}}

==Abortion debate==
[[Image:Prolife-DC.JPG|thumb|right|240px||Pro-life activists in Washington, DC stage a silent demonstration before the Supreme Court.]]
{{main|abortion debate}}

Over the course of the [[history of abortion]], induced abortions have been a source of considerable [[debate]] and [[controversy]] regarding the morality and legality of this practice. An individual's position on the complex [[ethical]], [[moral]], [[philosophical]], [[biological]], and [[legal]] issues have a strong relationship with that individual's [[value system]]. A person's position on abortion may be best described as a combination of their personal beliefs on the morality of abortion, and that person's beliefs on the ethical scope and responsibility of legitimate [[government|governmental]] and legal [[authority]]. Another factor for many individuals is [[religion|religious]] doctrine (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by [[advocacy|advocacy groups]] belonging to one of two camps. Most often those in favor of legal prohibition of abortion describe themselves as [[pro-life]] while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as [[pro-choice]].  Both are used to indicate the central principles in arguments for and against abortion:  &quot;Is the fetus a human being with a fundamental right to ''life''?&quot; for pro-life advocates, and, for those who are pro-choice, &quot;Does a woman have the right to ''choose'' whether or not to have an abortion?&quot;

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of [[laws]] permitting or restricting abortion. Arguments on morality and legality tend to collide and combine, complicating the issue at hand.

Debate also focuses on whether the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman should have to notify and/or have the [[consent]] of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]] her parents; a [[marriage|legally-married]] or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife her husband; or a pregnant woman the biological father.  In a 2003 [[Gallup]] poll in the [[United States]], 72% of respondents were in favor of spousal notification, with 26% opposed; of those polled, 79% of males and 67% of females responded in favor. {{ref|abortiondebate1}}

===Public opinion===
Political sides have largely been divided into [[moral absolutism|absolutes]]. The abortion debate, as such, tends to center around individuals who hold strong positions. However, public opinion varies from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region:

*'''Australia''': In a February 2005 [[AC Nielsen]] poll, as reported in [[The Age]], 56% thought the [[Abortion in Australia|current abortion laws]], which generally allow abortion for the sake of life or health, were &quot;about right,&quot; 16% want changes in law to make abortion &quot;more accessible,&quot; and 17% want changes to make it &quot;less accessible.&quot; {{ref|publicopinion1}} A 1998 poll, conducted by Roy Morgan Research, asked, &quot;Do you approve of the termination of unwanted pregnancies through surgical abortion?&quot; 65% of the [[Australia| Australians]] polled stated that they approved of surgical abortion and 25% stated that they disapproved of it. {{ref|publicopinion2}}

* '''Canada''': A recent poll of [[Canadians]], conducted in April 2005 by [[Gallup]], found that  52% of those polled want abortion laws to &quot;remain the same,&quot; 20% want the laws to be &quot;less strict,&quot; and 24% would prefer that the laws become &quot;more strict.&quot; An earlier Gallup poll, from December 2001, asked, &quot;Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances and in what circumstances?&quot; 32% of Canadians responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstance, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should be legal in no circumstances. See [[Abortion in Canada]].

*'''Ireland''': A 1997 [[Irish Times]]/MRBI poll of the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland's]] electorate found that 18% believe that abortion should never be permitted, 35% that one should be allowed in the event that the woman's life is threatened, 18% if her health is at risk, 28% that &quot;an abortion should be provided to those who need it,&quot; and 5% were undecided. {{ref|publicopinion3}}

* '''The United Kingdom''': An online [[YouGov]]/[[Daily Telegraph]] poll in August 2005 found that 30% of [[The United Kingdom| Britons]] would back a measure to reduce the legal limit for abortion to 20 weeks, 19% support a limit of 12 weeks, 9% support a limit of less than 12 weeks, and 25% support maintaining the current limit of 24 weeks. 6% responded that abortion should never be allowed while 2% said it should be permitted throughout the entirety of pregnancy. {{ref|publicopinion4}}

* '''The United States''': In a January 2006 [[CBS News]] poll, which asked, &quot;What is your personal feeling about abortion?&quot;, 27% said that abortion should be &quot;permitted in all cases,&quot; 15% that it should be &quot;permitted, but subject to greater restrictions than it is now,&quot; 33% that it should be &quot;permitted only in cases such as rape, incest or to save the woman's life,&quot; 17% that it should &quot;only be permitted to save the woman's life,&quot; and 5% that it should &quot;never&quot; be permitted. {{ref|publicopinion5}} A November 2005 [[Pew Research Center]] poll asked &quot;In 1973 the Roe versus Wade decision established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, at least in the first three months of pregnancy. Would you like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe versus Wade decision, or not?&quot;, with 29% indicating they want it overturned, and 65% that they do not. {{ref|publicopinion6}}

==Abortion law==
{{main|Abortion law}}

[[Image:AbortionLawsMap.png|thumb|250px|right|International status of abortion law]]
The [[Soviet Union]] (1920) and [[Iceland]] (1935) were some of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the twentieth century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in many other countries. In 1973, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an inferred [[right to privacy]] in the [[U.S. Constitution]].  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in the case of [[R. v. Morgentaler]].  Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of [[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].  [[Ireland]], on the other hand, added an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland| amendment]] to its [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular referendum, recognizing &quot;the right to life of the unborn&quot; (see [[Abortion in Ireland]]).

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to [[liberty]], and the right to [[security of person]] are major issues of [[human rights]] that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or the absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a [[trimester]]-based system to regulate the window in which abortion is still legal to perform:

* In the [[United States]], some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[fetal development]], or require that parents be contacted if their [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter requests an abortion.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.
Other countries, in which abortion is illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of [[rape]], [[incest]], or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health. A handful of nations ban abortion entirely, such as [[Chile]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Malta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.

==Abstraction of Title==

The Abstraction of Title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage]]s, and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.

==Clear Title==

A Clear Title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a more efficient system of insuring title real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

== Patent law ==

In the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in [[United States]] patent law) of an invention.

An '''AOLamer''' or AOL Lamer is a person using [[AOL]] that posts [[flamebait]] or other [[off-topic]] [[message]]s in a [[newsgroup]] in order to disrupt the newsgroup.

During the early 1990s, many regular non-AOL internet newsgroup users routinely killed all messages coming from AOL as many of the messages coming from AOL were non-informative.

In addition, the term '''AOLamer''' is often used as a derogatory term for AOL subscribers by users of other internet service providers, who view AOL as a provider associated with people who know little about computers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hawkeyepierce.gif|thumb|200px|right|Alan Alda as Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce]]
'''Alan Alda''' (born [[January 28]], [[1936]] as '''Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo''') is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[writer]], [[film director|director]] and sometimes [[politics|political]] activist.  

He is most famous for his role as [[Hawkeye Pierce]] in the [[television]] series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. In the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]] he was viewed as the archetypal &quot;sensitive male&quot;, though in recent years he has appeared in roles which counter that image. 

==Family and early life==
Alda was born in [[New York City]]. His [[Italian American|Italian-American]] father, [[Robert Alda]] (born Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo), was a successful actor, and his mother [[Joan Brown]] was crowned &quot;Miss New York&quot; in a [[beauty pageant]]. The adopted surname &quot;Alda&quot; is a contraction of &quot;'''AL'''phonso&quot; and &quot;'''D'A'''bruzzo&quot;.

When Alan Alda was growing up, his parents divorced.

Alan Alda contracted [[polio]] when he was seven years old, which kept him bedridden for two years as he received treatments.

Alan Alda's half-brother, [[Anthony Alda]] was christened '''Antonio D'Abruzzo''' on the 9th of [[December]] [[1956]].

He received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Fordham University]] in [[1956]]. During his junior year, he studied in [[Europe]] where he acted in a play in [[Rome]] and performed with his father on television in [[Amsterdam]]. After graduation, he joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army Reserve]] and served a six-month tour of duty as a gunnery officer in Korea following the [[Korean War]]. A year after graduation, he married Arlene Weiss, with whom he has three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth and Beatrice. [[Arlene Alda]] is a well known photographer, author and clarinettist.

Raised as a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], he has since left the church but continues to celebrate religious holidays and events. His specific religious beliefs are difficult to define.

He is also an activist for [[feminism|feminist]] causes, and has been for many years.

==Acting career, fame, and ''M*A*S*H''==
Alda began his career in the [[1950s]] as a member of the [[Compass Players]] comedy revue.

In the eleven years (72-83) he starred in ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', he was nominated for 21 [[Emmy Awards]] winning five. He wrote (or co-wrote) twenty episodes, and directed thirty episodes.  When he won his first Emmy Award for writing, he was so happy that he performed a [[cartwheel]] before running up to the stage to accept the award. He also was the first person to win Emmy Awards for acting, writing, and directing for the same series.  Interestingly enough, the late [[H. Richard Hornberger|Richard Hooker]], who wrote the novel on which ''M*A*S*H'' was based, did not like Alan Alda's portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce (Hooker had based Hawkeye on himself), though Hooker didn't care for the show in general.

==After ''M*A*S*H''==
Alda's prominence in the enormously successful ''M*A*S*H'' gave him a platform to speak out on political topics, and he has been a strong and vocal supporter of [[women's rights]]. As such, he has been something of a [[boogeyman]] for some political [[social conservative]]s who disagree with his views.

He has also appeared in at least two TV commercials.  Both of these were in the small-computer industry, first for [[Atari]] and later, with the rest of the ''M*A*S*H'' cast, for [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[PS/2]] product line with [[Micro Channel architecture|MicroChannel architecture]].

[[Image:Alan_Alda.jpg|thumb|left|Alan Alda as Senator Vinick.]]
Alan Alda has also played [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in the play [[QED (play)|''QED'']], which has only one other character. Although [[Peter Parnell]] wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of [[Woody Allen]], and he has been a guest star five times on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', playing Dr. Gabriel Lawrence.

As of [[2004 in television|2004]], Alda is a regular cast member on the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] program ''[[The West Wing (television)|The West Wing]]'', portraying [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and presidential hopeful [[Arnold Vinick]]. He made his premiere in the sixth season's tenth episode, &quot;In The Room&quot;, and was added to the opening credits with the thirteenth episode, &quot;King Corn.&quot;

Throughout his career, he has been nominated for the Emmy Award 31 times and the [[Tony Award]] twice, and has won seven [[People's Choice Award]]s, six [[Golden Globe]] awards, and three [[Director's Guild of America]] awards.  However, it was not until [[2004]], after a long acting career, that Alda received his first nomination for an Academy Award.  This was the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] nomination for his role as Senator [[Ralph Owen Brewster]] in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[The Aviator]]''. 

In the spring of 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]],'' for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

It has become quite normal for Alda in his later roles to have some reference to his early work in ''M*A*S*H''. For instance, both the senator he played in ''The Aviator'' and Hawkeye Pierce came from [[Maine]]. In a line on ''ER'', his character mentions that he uses a surgical technique he picked up in a &quot;military hospital&quot;. The same character also undergoes a mental acuity test where he has to identify pictures of objects. He sees a funnel and identifies it as a martini glass without the base (Hawkeye Pierce was very fond of martinis).  Alda's ''West Wing'' character has also made at least one reference to [[Korea]] when he said, &quot;I could take these people to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] and it still wouldn't take their minds off ethanol and abortion&quot;).

In 2005, Alda published his first round of memoirs, ''Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned'', published by [[Random House]] (ISBN 1400064090). Among other stories, he recalls his [[intestine]]s becoming strangulated while on location in [[Chile]] for his PBS show ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]''. He also talks about his mother's battle with [[schizophrenia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- NOTE  TO EDITORS -- Remember, this is an *introductory* article to American football. It exists to give people who know little or nothing about the sport a basic understanding of the game. Information that does not fall under that description should go under [[American-football strategy]], [[American football rules]], etc. --&gt;

'''American football''', known in the [[United States]] &lt;!--but not Canada; what they call &quot;football&quot;is actually the similar (but NOT identical) sport of Canadian football--&gt; simply as '''football''', is a competitive team [[sport]]. The object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team's [[end zone]] and score points. The ball can be advanced by carrying the ball, or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other. Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the goal line, throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or [[placekicker|kicking]] it through the goal posts. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires.

Outside of the [[United States]] and a few other countries such as [[American Samoa]], the sport is usually referred to as ''American football'' (or sometimes as [[gridiron]]) to differentiate it from other football games, especially [[football (soccer)|association football (soccer)]] and [[rugby football]]. American football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late 19th century. [[Arena football]] is a variant of American football.  In [[Canada]], the unqualified term &quot;football&quot; typically refers to [[Canadian football]], a game which is a close relative of American football but different in several respects.

==Popularity==
Since the 1960s, football has surpassed [[baseball]] as the most popular [[spectator sport]] in the United States. The 32-team [[National Football League]] (NFL) is the most popular and only [[major professional sports league|major]] professional American football [[Sports league|league]]. Its championship game, the [[Super Bowl]], is watched by nearly half of US television households, and is also televised in over 150 other countries. ''[[Super Bowl Sunday]]'' has become an annual ritual in late January or early February. Football is also the most watched sport on [[television]] in the US. 

The NFL also operates a developmental league, [[NFL Europe]], with 6 teams based in European cities.

[[Image:American football tackle.jpg|thumb|250px|American football is a physically demanding sport.]]
--&gt;
[[College football]] is also extremely popular throughout the U.S., especially in markets not served by an NFL team.  Several college football stadiums seat more than 100,000 fans -- which regularly sell out. Even [[high school]] football games can attract five-figure crowds, especially in [[hotbed]]s like Western [[Pennsylvania]], [[Nebraska]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and most especially [[Texas]], [[Ohio]], and [[California]]. The weekly autumn ritual of college and high-school football -- which includes [[marching band]]s, [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] and parties (including the ubiquitous [[tailgate party]]) -- is an important part of the culture in much of [[small-town|smalltown America]].  It is a long-standing tradition in the United States (though not universally observed) that high school football games are played on [[Friday]], college games on [[Saturday]], and professional games on [[Sunday]] (with an additional professional game on [[Monday]] nights--see ''[[Monday Night Football]]'').  It is often said of an outstanding college football player that he is likely to &quot;be playing on Sundays one day&quot;, meaning that he is a good pro prospect.

Certain fall and winter [[holiday]]s--most notably [[Thanksgiving]], [[Christmas]], and [[New Years' Day]]--have traditional football games associated with them.

Football is also played recreationally by amateur club and youth teams (e.g., the [[Pop Warner]] little-league programs). There are also many &quot;semi-pro&quot; teams in leagues where the players are paid to play, but at a small enough salary that they generally must also hold a full-time job.

Pro football is played only in the United States and in the above-mentioned NFL Europe league. The sport is popular as an amateur activity in [[Mexico]] and [[American Samoa]] and to a lesser extent in [[Japan]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]].

A very similar sport, [[Canadian football]], is widely played in [[Canada]].

Organized football is played almost exclusively by men and boys, although a few amateur and semi-professional women's leagues have begun play in recent years.

==The rules of American football==
{{See also|American football rules}}
&lt;!--This section should only be a basic tutorial. Lengthy content should go to [[American football rules]]--&gt;

The object of American football is to score more points than the opposing team within a set time limit.

===Field and players===
[[Image:AmFBfield.png|right|frame|The numbers on the field indicate the number of [[yard]]s to the nearest end zone.]]

The field is often called the ''gridiron'' because the markings on the field resemble a [[Grill (cooking)|grill]]. The game is played on a rectangular field 120 [[yard]]s (110 [[metre]]s) long by 53 1/3 yards (49 metres) wide. The longer boundary lines are ''sidelines'', while the shorter boundary lines are ''end lines''. Near each end of the field is a ''goal line''; they are 100 yards apart. A scoring area called an ''[[end zone]]'' extends 10 yards beyond each goal line to each end line.

''Yard lines'' cross the field every 5 yards, and are numbered from each goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield (similar to a typical [[rugby league]] field). Two rows of lines, known as ''hash marks'', parallel the side lines near the middle of the field. All plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks.

At the back of each end zone are two ''goal posts'' (also called ''uprights'') that are 18.5 feet apart. The posts are connected by a crossbar 10 feet from the ground. Successful kicks must go above the crossbar and between the uprights.  (At many fields the uprights and crossbar are attached by a curved bar to a post outside the field of play, to reduce the chance of players running into the supports.)

Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. However, teams may substitute for any or all of their players between plays. As a result, players have very specialized roles, and almost all of the 53 players on an NFL team will play in any given game. Thus, teams are divided into three separate units: the [[offensive team|offense]], the [[defensive team|defense]] and the [[special teams]] (see below). In the NFL, players' [[jersey number]]s are distributed according to a strict system (e.g. quarterbacks always wear between 1-19).

===Game duration===
A standard football game consists of four 15-minute (typically 12 minutes in high school football) periods (called quarters), with an intermission (called halftime) after the second quarter. The clock stops after certain plays; therefore, a game can last considerably longer (often more than three hours in real time). If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, the teams play up to another 15 minutes. In an NFL overtime game, the first team that scores wins; if neither team scores, the game is a tie. College overtime rules are more complicated and are described at [[Overtime (sport)]].

===Advancing the ball===
Advancing the ball in American football resembles the ''six-tackle rule'' and the ''play-the-ball'' in [[Rugby league|rugby league football]]. The team that takes possession of the ball (the '''offense''') has four attempts, called '''[[Down (football)|downs]]''', to advance the ball 10 yards towards their opponent's (the '''defense'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s) end zone. When the offense gains 10 yards, it gets a '''first down''', or another set of four downs to gain 10 yards. If the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after 4 downs, it loses possession of the ball.

Except at the beginning of halves and after scores (see ''Kickoffs and free kicks'' below), the ball is always put into play by a '''[[Snap (American football)|snap]]'''. All players line up facing each other at the [[line of scrimmage]] (the position on the field where the play begins).  One offensive player, the [[Center (football)|center]], then passes (or &quot;snaps&quot;) the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the [[quarterback]].

Players can then advance the ball in two ways:
* By running with the ball, also known as '''[[Rush (football)|rushing]]'''. One ball-carrier can hand the ball to another; this is known as a '''handoff'''. 
* By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as '''passing'''.  The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward only once on a play and only from behind the line of scrimmage.  The ball can be thrown sideways or backwards at any time. This type of pass is known as a '''[[Lateral pass|lateral]]''' and is much rarer in American football than in rugby league or rugby union, where a backwards pass is mandatory.

A play or down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
* The player with the ball is forced to the ground or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team (as determined by an official).
* A forward pass flies out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an '''[[incomplete pass]]'''.  The ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down.  
* The ball or the player with the ball goes beyond the dimensions of the field ('''out of bounds''').
* A team scores.
* A certain penalty is committed (such as false start) that causes the play to be blown dead and replayed.
[[Official (American football)|Officials]] blow a whistle to notify all players that the play is over. 

At all times, players and fans must be aware of the sequence of downs and the distance to a new first down. When a team has a first down, the scoreboard or television screen flashes &quot;1st and 10&quot; ‚Äî that is, first down and 10 yards to go. If the team gains three yards on the first play, for example, the next down will be &quot;2nd and 7.&quot;

===Changes of possession===
The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things happens:

* The team fails to get a first down, that is, move the ball forward at least 10 yards in four downs. The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the play ends.  A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a '''turnover on downs'''.
* The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then kicks off the ball to the other team. (See Scoring and Kickoffs below.) 
* The offense punts the ball to the defense. A '''[[punt (football)|punt]]''' is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are nearly always made on fourth down, when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field (through a failed attempt to make a first down) and feels it is too far from the other team's goal posts to kick a field goal.
* A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an '''[[interception]]''', and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores. After the intercepting player is tackled or forced out of bounds, his team's offensive unit returns to the field and takes over at his last position. 
* An offensive player drops the ball (a '''[[fumble]]''') and a defensive player picks it up. As with interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled or forced out of bounds. Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as '''turnovers'''.
* The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot of the kick). If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within 20 yards of the end zone, the other team gets the ball at its own 20-yard line (that is, 20 yards from the end zone). 
* An offensive player is tackled, forced out of bounds, or commits certain penalties in his own end zone.  This rare occurrence is called a '''[[Safety (football)|safety]]'''. (See ''Scoring'' below.)

===Scoring===
A team scores points by the following plays:
* A '''[[touchdown]]''' (TD) is worth 6 points. A touchdown is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone. 
** After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a '''conversion'''. The ball is placed at the other team's 3-yard-line (the 2-yard-line in the NFL). The team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for 1 point (an '''[[extra point]]'''), or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 2 points (a '''[[two-point conversion]]''').  In [[collegiate]] and [[professional]] leagues, the extra point is usually preferred; its success rate is 94% in the [[NFL]] and 93.8% in the [[NCAA]], compared to 43% in the [[NFL]] and 43.5% in the [[NCAA]] for two-point conversions. If the defense forces a turnover on an attempted conversion and runs the ball back to their opponent's endzone, they are awarded with 2 points (does not apply in the NFL).
* A '''[[field goal]]''' (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts. Field goals may be placekicked (kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate) or drop-kicked. A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the goal line, or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score.
* A '''[[Safety (football)|safety]]''' is worth 2 points. A safety is scored by the ''defense'' when the offensive player in possession of the ball is forced back into his own end zone and is tackled there, or fumbles the ball out of the end zone. Certain penalties by the offense occurring in the end zone also result in a safety.

===Kickoffs and free kicks===
Each half begins with a [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]. Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals. The ball is kicked from a kicking tee, which is made from one's own 30-yard line in the NFL and from the 35-yard line in college football. The other team's kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its '''drive''', or series of offensive plays. If a kick returner does not want to run with the ball, he has the option to signal for a &quot;fair catch&quot; by waving his hands in the air before the catch.  He will then be allowed to catch the ball and kneel it down on the field without being tackled.  If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone, he can either run with the ball, or elect for a '''[[touchback]]''' by kneeling in the end zone. The receiving team can then start its offensive drive from its own 20-yard line. A touchback can also occur when the kick goes out of the end zone. Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in touchbacks. If a kickoff goes out of bounds over the sidelines without being interfered by the receiving team, the ball will be placed 30 yards from the spot of the kickoff (traditionally at the receiving team's 40-yard line in the NFL or the 35-yard line in college football).

After safeties, there is a '''[[Safety (American football)#free kick|free kick]]''' instead of a kickoff. A free kick is made from a team's own 20-yard-line and can be punted or placekicked.

===Penalties===
Rule violations are punished with '''penalties'''. Most penalties result in moving the football either towards the endzone in the case of a defensive penalty, or away from the endzone in the case of an offensive penalty. Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down. In addition, if a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down, the first down is automatically given.  If a penalty occurs during a play, an official throws a yellow flag near the spot of the foul. When the play is over, the team that did not commit the penalty has the option of taking either the penalty or the result of the play. For example, say a defensive player commits an offsides penalty on first down by passing the line of scrimmage before the snap, and the offense gains eight yards on the play. The team with the ball has the option of taking the penalty and repeat the first down with five yards to go, or declining the penalty and scrimmaging with 2nd and 2.

====Some common penalties====
* '''False start''': A player on the offense, other than a back moving parallel to the line of scrimmage, moves just prior to the snap. Five yards.
* '''Offsides''': A player is on the wrong side of the ball at the start of a play.  Five yards.  Similar fouls:  Touching an opponent before the snap is '''encroachment'''; lining up alongside the football instead of behind it is a '''neutral zone infraction'''.
* '''Holding''': A blocker unfairly impedes a would-be tackler or pass receiver, by grabbing the player's jersey, hooking, or tackling.  When commited by the offense, or by either team on a change of possession, the penalty is ten yards.  When committed by the defense, the penalty is five yards and an automatic first down is awarded to the offense.  If the penalty occurred beyond the line of scrimmage, the penalty would be enforced from the spot of the foul.
* '''Pass interference''': After a pass is launched into the air, a defender pushes, hooks, grabs, or knocks down a would-be pass receiver, or if the receiver does the same to the defender to prevent an interception.  First down at the spot of the foul if against the defense (15 yards from the previous spot in college football), or ten yards from the previous spot if against the offense.  Similar penalties before a pass are called as '''holding''' or '''illegal contact'''.
* '''Facemask''': a player places his hand on an opponent's facemask during a play.  Five yards, or fifteen (a '''personal foul''') if the player hooks his fingers into the facemask or pulls on it.
* '''Roughing the passer/kicker''': A player places a hard hit on a passer long enough after a pass has been thrown to consider the contact avoidable, or places a hard hit on a punter or place kicker.  Fifteen yards and automatic first down.
* '''Running into the kicker''': A lighter contact on a kicker, especially after the kick has been made.  Five yards.
* '''Intentional grounding''': The passer throws a forward pass not near any eligible receiver, without first leaving the area behind where the blocking linemen were standing before the snap (the &quot;pocket&quot;), or the passer throws a forward pass outside of the pocket which does not reach the original '''line of scrimmage''' and is not near any eligible receiver.  Ten yards plus loss of down, except if the penalty occurred in the end zone, then it is ruled a safety, and the defense is awarded 2 points.  In college football and high school football, the defense is also credited with a quarterback sack.  Note that spiking the ball to stop the clock is exempt from this.
* '''Ineligible receiver downfield''': On every play the offense must have 7 players on the line of scrimmage, the player furthest from the ball on each side are eligible receivers; the interior five players are considered ineligible to receive passes.  This penalty is called if one of the 5 interior players is more than five yards past the line of scrimmage during a forward pass.
* '''Dead ball personal foul''': After the play is blown dead, a player tackles or makes rough contact with a player on the other team. Fifteen yards, automatic first down if on defense.
* '''Unnecessary roughness''': A catch-all for rough play that doesn't merit its own foul.  An example is an avoidable late hit on a ball carrier who has run out of bounds.  Fifteen yards.
* '''Unsportsmanlike conduct''': Another catch-all call, commonly used for taunting, excessive celebration after a touchdown, and certain banned forms of pantomime (like slashing the throat).  Fifteen yards.

==The players==
{{Main|American football positions}}
As noted above, most football players have highly specialized roles. At the college and NFL levels, most play only offense or only defense.

===Offense===
* The '''[[offensive line]]''' consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense. Except for the center, offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball.
* The '''[[quarterback]]''' receives the ball on most plays. He then hands or tosses it to a running back, throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself. 
*'''[[Running back]]s''' line up behind or beside the QB and specialize in rushing with the ball. They also block, catch passes and, on rare occasions, pass the ball to others.
*'''[[Wide receiver]]s''' line up near the sidelines. They specialize in catching passes.
*'''[[Tight end]]s''' line up outside the offensive line. They can either play like wide receivers (try to catch passes) or like offensive linemen (protect the QB or create spaces for runners).

Not all of these types of players will be in on every offensive play. Teams can vary the number of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs on the field at one time.

===Defense===
* The '''[[defensive line]]''' consists of three to five players who line up across from the offensive line. They try to tackle the running backs before they can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw a pass.
* At least three players line up as '''[[defensive back]]s'''. They cover the receivers and try to stop pass completions. They occasionally rush the quarterback. 
* The other players on the defense are known as '''[[linebacker]]s'''. They line up between the defensive line and backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers.

===Special teams===
The units of players who handle kicking plays are known as '''[[special teams]]'''. Special-teams feature players that include the '''[[punter (football position)|punter]]''', who handles punts, and the '''[[placekicker]]''' or '''kicker''', who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points.

==Basic football strategy==
{{Main|American football strategy}}

To many fans, the chief draw of football is the chess game that goes on between the two coaching staffs. Each team has a '''playbook''' of dozens to hundreds of plays. Plays are the directions for what the players should do on a down. Some plays are very safe; they are very likely to get a few yards, but not much more than that. Other plays have the potential for long gains but a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover. 

Generally speaking, rushing plays are less risky than passing plays. However, there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays. To fool the other team, there are passing plays designed to look like running plays and vice versa. There are many trick or gadget plays, such as when a team lines up like it is going to kick and then tries to run or pass for a first down. Such high-risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work.  However, they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly.

It has been said that football is the closest sport that strategically resembles real war, which may explain why it is by far the most popular sport in the American military. In fact, the [[United States Military Academy]], the [[United States Naval Academy]], and the [[United States Air Force Academy]] each field football teams that participate in [[Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Army and Navy have a particularly historic [[Army-Navy Game|rivalry]].

==A physical game==
American football is a collision sport. To stop the offense from advancing the ball, the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking him down. As such, defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball-carrier to the ground, within certain rules and guidelines. Tacklers cannot kick, punch or trip the runner. They also cannot grab the face mask of the runner's helmet, lead into a tackle with their own helmet, or lift the ball carrier up off his feet and drop him. Despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness, most other forms of tackling are legal. Blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way. Quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback's field of vision. 

The high level of physical contact in football makes it more dangerous than other major American team sports. To compensate for this, players must wear a good deal of special protective equipment, such as a padded plastic [[football helmet|helmet]], [[shoulder pads]], hip pads and knee pads. These protective &quot;paddings&quot; were introduced decades ago and improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. 

Despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety, injuries remain very common in football, due to its physical nature. Twenty-five football players, mostly high schoolers, died from injuries directly related to football from 2000-2004, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.  [[concussion|Concussions]] are common, with an estimated 62,000 suffered every year among high school players according to the Brain Injury Association of Arizona.  [http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-23-2005/0004093186&amp;EDATE=].  It is common to see injuries in the game, and deaths are not unheard of. The game is particularly risky when played by amateurs without proper gear, such as is common amongst Americans in backyards and parks across the country. 

Some have criticized American football as a violent sport. American football is indeed quite physical in comparison to sports like [[basketball]] and [[soccer]] as well as other major American team sports. Tackle football is often banned in American schoolyards in favor of [[touch football]], which uses two-hand touching instead of tackling; or [[flag football]] in which a player is &quot;tackled&quot; when an opponent pulls a flag off a belt attached to the player's waist.  School [[physical education]] classes often use the &quot;two-hand touch&quot; version of the game, leaving the tackles to the school's official after-school sports program which can provide the appropriate gear and supervision.

The level of physical aggression and risk of injury has also made football less appealing to females, as they generally lack the muscle and body mass to compete without serious risk. The tackle nature of football also tends to favor the largest and strongest players, along with the fastest. The average weight of players in the NFL has increased in recent years.

All these factors have brought the sport into controversy in the past few decades, joining the group of other &quot;violent&quot; and thus controversial sports such as [[dodgeball]], [[wrestling]], [[hockey]], and [[boxing]]. Critics argue that these sports emphasize size, physical strength, and brute force, and breed aggression and unhealthy competitive attitudes in children. Others argue that such sports teach sportsmanship and teamwork, and though [[contact sports]] are all violent to some degree, they always emphasize skill and strategy over mere belligerence.

==Development of the game==
{{Details|History of American football}}

Both American football and soccer have their origins in [[football|varieties of football]] played in the [[United Kingdom]] in the mid-19th century, and American football is directly descended from [[rugby football]].

Rugby was first introduced to North America in [[Canada]], brought by the [[British Army]] garrison in [[Montreal]] which played a series of games with [[McGill University]]. Both Canadian and American football evolved from this point. For an in-depth overview of the differences and similarities of [[Canadian football]] and American football see: [[Comparison of Canadian and American football]]

American colleges spearheaded the growth of football.  The [http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first_game.htm first inter-collegiate football game] was played between Rutgers and Princeton Universities on November 6, 1869.  The game was won by Rutgers (6-4) although &quot;The game, which bore little resemblance to its modern-day counterpart, was played with two teams of 25 men each under rugby-like rules, but like modern football, it was ‚Äúreplete with surprise, strategy, prodigies of determination, and physical prowess,‚Äù to use the words of one of the Rutgers players.&quot; - [http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first_game.htm Rutgers Football]

American football in its current form grew out of a series of three games between [[Harvard University]] and [[McGill University]] of [[Montreal]] in 1874. McGill played [[rugby football]] while Harvard played the [[Boston Game]], which was closer to soccer. As often happened in those days of far from universal rules, the teams alternated rules so that both would have a fair chance. The Harvard players liked having the opportunity to run with the ball, and in 1875 persuaded [[Yale University]] to adopt rugby rules for their annual game. In 1876 Yale, Harvard, [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] formed the [[Intercollegiate Football Association]], which used the rugby code, except for a slight difference in scoring.

In 1880 [[Walter Camp]] introduced the scrimmage in place of the rugby [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]. In 1882 the system of downs was introduced to thwart Princeton's and Yale's strategy of controlling the ball without trying to score. In 1883 the number of players was reduced, at Camp's urging, to eleven, and Camp introduced the soon standard arrangement of a seven-man offensive line with a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback.

On [[September 3]], [[1895]] the first professional football game was played, in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], between the Latrobe [[YMCA]] and the Jeannette Athletic Club. (Latrobe won the contest 12-0.).  

By the 1890s interlocking offensive formations such as the flying wedge and the practice of teammates physically dragging ball-carrying players forward had made the game extremely dangerous. Despite restrictions on the flying wedge and other precautions, in 1905 eighteen players were killed in games. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] informed the universities that the game must be made safer.  To force them to respond to his concerns, he threatened to pressure Congress to make playing football a federal crime.

In 1906, two rival organizing bodies, the [[Intercollegiate Rules Committee]] and the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]], met in New York; eventually they agreed on several new rules intended to make the game safer, among them the addition of a neutral zone between the scrimmage lines and a requirement that at least six players from each team line up on them. The most far-reaching innovation they considered, though, was the legalization of the forward pass. This was very controversial at the time, much derided by purists. As an alternative means of opening out the play, Walter Camp would have preferred widening the field; but representatives from Harvard pointed to recently constructed [[Harvard Stadium]], which could not be widened, and the forward pass was adopted; it has come to shape the whole history of American football, as opposed to its cousins around the world.

In 1910, after further deaths, interlocking formations were finally outlawed; and in 1912 the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. The game had achieved its modern form.

==Problems in football==
{{Main|Issues in American Football}}

Injuries are more common in American football than in many other sports, although rule changes made in the past 90 years (for instance, the elimination of &quot;[[Horse-collar tackle|horse-collar tackles]]&quot;) have gradually lowered the rates of injuries. In addition, protective equipment has become better - for example, the optional leather helmets introduced during the 1890s have been replaced (in several stages) by required high-tech padded plastic helmets with bars protecting the face.

More recently, the use of steroids and the extent thereof has become an object of debate in professional, college, and even high school football leagues.

Another problem with football is that it is an expensive sport.  The specialized helmets, uniforms, and pads can cost hundreds of dollars.  There is a widespread perception that football teams based in schools and public recreational leagues consume far more than their fair share of the sports budget, although sales of tickets to college (and to some extent high school) football games often make it a revenue-producing sport.

==Professional, college, and other leagues==
Football is played at a number of levels in the United States.  These include the following:
* [[National Football League]] (NFL) - the top-level men's professional league
* [[NFL Europe]] - semi-professional league in [[Europe]]
* [[College football]] - played at many U.S. colleges
* [[American Football Association]] National organization for the advancement and promotion of semi-pro/minor league football teams and leagues in the United States.
* [[North American Football League]] - Amateur minor league with more than 100 member organizations since 1996
* [[Women's American football]] - since 2000, there has been a surge of women's professional leagues.
* High school football - played at most U.S. High Schools
* [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] or youth football - involves younger children who are too young to play high school, generally in middle school.
* [[Sprint football]] - players must weigh no more than 172 pounds

American football is also played in many nations around the world.  Some of the organizations/leagues that play American football are:
* [[Mexican College Football]] League or [[ONEFA]] - played by many Mexican colleges, with essentially NCAA rules
* [[British Collegiate American Football League]] (BCAFL) - Fast-growing college football league in the UK
* [[British American Football League]] (BAFL)-Higher League of American Football in the UK
* [[European Federation of American Football]] (www.efaf.info) European organization that crowns its champion in the [[Euro Bowl]]
* [[German Football League]]
* [[Gridiron Australia]] - national body of several state-level leagues
* [[International Federation of American Football]] International governing body for American football with 39 member associations from North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania.  The IFAF also overseas the World Championship of American Football.
* [[Okinawan Football League]] - Various football teams made up of U.S. servicemembers and one from Ryuku University

Other kinds of football with quite different rules:
* [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) - men's professional league based in [[Canada]], played using different rules known as [[Canadian football]]
* [[Arena Football League]] - mid-level men's professional league. Played in indoor stadiums, hence the name &quot;arena&quot; football. One of the nation's fastest-growing sports.
* [[Nine-man football]], [[Eight-man football]], and [[Six-man football]] - variations of high school football, usually played in sparsely populated areas
* Amateur and youth league football
* [[Flag football]] and [[Touch football (American)|Touch football]] - non-tackle; almost exclusively amateur

The descriptions in this article are based primarily on the current rules of the [[National Football League]] (NFL, 1920-present). Differences with college rules will be noted. Professional, college, high school, and amateur rules are similar.

Professional leagues that no longer exist:
* [[World Football League]] (WFL, 1974-75) 
* [[United States Football League]] (USFL, 1983-1985) 
* [[XFL]] (XFL, 2001)

The '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775‚Äì1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was the military component of the [[American Revolution]]. It was fought primarily between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and revolutionaries within [[13 colonies|thirteen British colonies]] in [[North America]], who proclaimed themselves as the [[United States|United States of America]] early in the war. The war began largely as a colonial revolt against the [[mercantilism|economic policies]] of the [[British Empire]], and eventually widened far beyond [[British North America]], with [[France]], [[Spain]], and the [[Netherlands]] entering the war against Great Britain. Additionally, many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] fought on both sides of the conflict.

Throughout the war, the British were able to use their naval superiority to capture and occupy coastal cities, but control of the countryside (where most of the population lived) largely eluded them. French involvement proved decisive, with a naval [[Battle of the Chesapeake|victory in the Chesapeake]] leading to the surrender of a British army at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]] in 1781. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 recognized the independence of the [[United States|United States of America]].

The terms ''American Revolutionary War'' and ''American Revolution'' are often used interchangeably, though the American Revolution included political and social developments before and after the war itself. This article refers solely to the military campaign; for a broader perspective, including the origins and aftermath of the war, see the article on the [[American Revolution]].

== Combatants ==
===Choosing sides===
Colonists were divided over which side to support in the war; in some areas, the struggle was a [[civil war]]. The [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Revolutionaries]] (also known as Americans or Patriots) had the support of about 40 to 45 percent of the colonial population. About 15 to 20 percent of the population supported the British Crown during the war, and were known as [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists (or Tories)]]. Loyalists fielded perhaps 50,000 men during the war years in support of the British Empire. After the war, some 70,000 Loyalists departed, most going to [[Canada]], Great Britain, or to British colonies in the [[Caribbean]].{{ref|loyalists}}

When the war began, the Americans did not have a professional [[armed force|army]] (also known as a &quot;[[standing army]]&quot;). Each colony had traditionally provided for its own defenses through the use of local [[militia]]. Militiamen served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were generally reluctant to go very far from home, and would often come and go as they saw fit. Militia typically lacked the training and discipline of regular troops, but could be effective when an emergency energized them. 

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[Continental Congress]] established (on paper) a regular army‚Äîthe [[Continental Army]]‚Äîin June 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as [[commander-in-chief]]. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war. Although as many as 250,000 men may have served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, there were never more than 90,000 total men under arms for the Americans in any given year. Armies in North America were small by European standards of the era; the greatest number of men that Washington personally commanded in the field at any one time was fewer than 17,000.{{ref|continental}}

===European nations===
[[Image:Us unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg|thumb|right|300px|German troops serving with the British in North America. (C Ziegler after Conrad Gessner, 1799)]]
Early in 1775, the British army consisted of about 36,000 men worldwide, but wartime [[recruitment]] steadily increased this number. Additionally, over the course of the war the British hired about 30,000 [[Ethnic German|German]] [[mercenaries]], popularly known in the colonies as &quot;[[Hessians]]&quot; because many of them came from [[Hesse-Kassel]]. Germans would make up about one-third of the British troop strength in North America. By 1779, the number of British and German troops stationed in North America was over 60,000, though these were spread from [[Canada]] to [[Florida]].{{ref|British}}

[[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]] entered the war against Great Britain in an attempt to dilute Britain's emerging [[superpower]] status. Early on, all three countries quietly provided financial assistance to the American rebels. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France officially entered the war]] in 1778 and soon sent troops, ships, and military equipment to fight against the British for the remainder of the war. Spain entered the war in 1779, officially as an ally of France but not the United States&amp;mdash;Spain was not keen on encouraging similar rebellions in [[Spanish Empire|her own empire]]. The Netherlands entered the war late in 1780, but was soon overwhelmed by the British.

===Blacks and Native Americans===
[[African-Americans]], [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[free black]]s, served on both sides during the war.  Black soldiers served in northern militias from the outset, but this was forbidden in the South, where slaveowners feared arming slaves. [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the Royal Governor of [[Virginia]], issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British; [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] issued a similar edict in New York in 1779.  Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to the British lines, although possibly as few as 1,000 served under arms.  Many of the rest served as orderlies, mechanics, laborers, servants, scouts and guides, although more than half died in smallpox epidemics that swept the British forces, and a number were driven out of the British lines when food ran low. Despite Dunmore's promises, the majority were not given their freedom.{{ref|black_loyalists}}

In response, and because of manpower shortages, Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters. Another all-black unit came from [[Haiti]] with French forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Patriot cause.{{ref|black_patriots}}

Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] communities east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, many divided over the question of which side to support. Most Native Americans who joined the fight fought against the United States, since native lands were threatened by expanding American settlement. An estimated 13,000 warriors fought on the British side; the largest group, the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], fielded about 1,500 warriors against the Americans.{{ref|warriors}}

== War in the North ==
=== Massachusetts, 1774 to 1776 ===
[[Image:American Revolution Campaigns 1775 to 1781.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Map of campaigns in the Revolutionary War]]

In 1774, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] effectively [[Massachusetts Government Act|abolished the provincial government]] of [[Massachusetts]]. [[Lieutenant General]] [[Thomas Gage]], already the [[commander-in-chief]] of British troops in North America, was also appointed governor of Massachusetts and was instructed by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George's]] government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony. However, popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Gage commanded four [[regiment]]s of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston, but the countryside was in the hands of the Revolutionaries.

On the night of [[April 18]] [[1775]], General Gage sent 900 men to seize [[munition]]s stored by the colonial militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. Several riders‚Äîincluding [[Paul Revere]]‚Äîalerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the morning of April 19, they found 75 [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, and the British moved on to Concord, where there was more fighting. By the time the &quot;redcoats&quot; (as the British soldiers were called) began the return march, several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road. A running fight ensued, and the British detachment suffered heavily. With the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]]‚Äîthe &quot;[[shot heard 'round the world]]&quot;‚Äîthe war had begun.

Afterwards, thousands of militiamen converged on Boston, [[siege of Boston|bottling up the British]] in the city. Late in May, Gage received by sea about 4,500 reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war: [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], [[John Burgoyne]], and [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]]. They formulated a plan to break out of the city.

On [[June 17]], [[1775]], British forces under General Howe seized the Charleston peninsula at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The battle was technically a British victory, but losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up. Thus the [[siege]] was not broken, and General Gage was soon replaced by General Howe as the British commander-in-chief.

In July 1775, newly appointed General Washington arrived outside Boston to take charge of the colonial forces. The standoff continued throughout the fall and winter. In early March 1776, heavy [[cannon]]s that had been [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1775)|captured by the Revolutionaries]] at [[Fort Ticonderoga]] were moved to Boston, a difficult feat engineered by [[Henry Knox]]. When the guns were placed on [[Dorchester Heights]], overlooking the British positions, Howe's situation became untenable. The British [[Evacuation Day|evacuated]] the city on [[March 17]], [[1776]] and sailed for temporary refuge in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. The local militia dispersed and, in April, Washington took most of the Continental Army to fortify [[New York City]].

=== Canada, 1775 to 1776 ===
During the long standoff at Boston, the Continental Congress sought a way to seize the initiative elsewhere. Congress had initially invited [[French-Canadian]]s to join them as the fourteenth colony, but when that failed to happen, an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] was authorized in an attempt to drive the British from the primarily [[francophone]] colony of Quebec (comprising present-day [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]). Two expeditions were undertaken. On [[September 16]], [[1775]], Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] marched north from Fort Ticonderoga with about 1,700 militiamen, capturing [[Montreal]] on November 13. General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], the governor of Canada, escaped to [[Quebec City|Quebec City]].

[[Arnold Expedition|The second expedition]], led by Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]], set out from [[Fort Western]] (present day [[Maine]]) on September 25. The expedition was a logistical nightmare, and many men succumbed to [[smallpox]]. By the time Arnold reached Quebec City in early November, he had but 600 of his original 1,100 men. Nevertheless, Arnold demanded the surrender of the city, to no avail. Montgomery joined Arnold, and they [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attacked Quebec City]] on December 31, but were soundly defeated by Carleton. Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, and many men were taken prisoner. The Americans held on outside Quebec City until the spring of 1776, and then withdrew.

Another attempt was made by the Revolutionaries to push back towards Quebec, but failed at [[Battle of Trois-Rivi√®res|Trois-Rivi√®res]] on [[June 8]], [[1776]]. Carleton then launched his own invasion, and defeated Arnold in the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] in October. Arnold fell back to Fort Ticonderoga, where the invasion of Canada had begun. The invasion of Canada ended as an embarrassing disaster for the Revolutionaries, but Arnold's improvised navy on Lake Champlain delayed the fateful British counter thrust (the [[Saratoga Campaign]]) until 1777.

=== New York and New Jersey, 1776 to 1777 ===
Having withdrawn from Boston, the British now focused on [[New York Campaign|capturing New York City]]. General Howe, with the services of his brother, [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Lord Howe]], began amassing troops on [[Staten Island]] in July 1776. General Washington, with a smaller army of about 20,000 men, unwittingly violated a cardinal rule of warfare, and divided his troops about equally between [[Long Island]] and [[Manhattan]], thus allowing the Howes to engage only one half of the Continental Army at a time.

In late August, the Howes transported about 22,000 men (including 9,000 &quot;Hessians&quot;) to Long Island. In the [[Battle of Long Island]] on [[August 27]], [[1776]], the British expertly executed a surprise flanking maneuver, driving the Revolutionaries back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications. General Howe then laid siege to the works, but Washington skillfully managed a nighttime evacuation to Manhattan.

Having taken Long Island, the Howes moved to seize Manhattan. On September 15, General Howe [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed about 12,000 men]] on lower Manhattan, quickly taking control of New York City. The Revolutionaries withdrew to Harlem Heights, where they [[Battle of Harlem Heights|skirmished the next day]], but held their ground.

When Howe moved to [[encirclement|encircle]] Washington's army in October, the Revolutionaries again fell back, and a [[Battle of White Plains|battle at White Plains]] was fought on [[October 28]], [[1776]]. Once more Washington retreated, but Howe, instead of aggressively pursuing the withdrawal, returned to Manhattan and captured [[Fort Washington]] in mid November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners. Four days later, [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], across the [[Hudson River]] from Fort Washington, was also taken.

[[Image:Washington Crossing the Delaware.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Emanuel Leutze]]'s 1851 painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' is an [[icon]]ic image of [[American history]].]]

[[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Lord Cornwallis]] continued to chase Washington's army through [[New Jersey]], until the Revolutionaries withdrew across the [[Delaware River]] into [[Pennsylvania]] in early December. With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season, the British entered winter quarters. Although Howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing rebel army, he had killed or captured over 5,000 Americans. He controlled much of New York and New Jersey, and was in a good position to resume operations in the spring, with the rebel capital of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in striking distance.

The outlook of the Continental Army‚Äîand thus the revolution itself‚Äîwas bleak. &quot;These are the times that try men's souls,&quot; wrote [[Thomas Paine]], who was with the army on the retreat. The army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men fit for duty, and would be reduced to 1,400 after enlistments expired at the end of the year. Spirits were low, popular support was wavering, and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia in despair.

Washington reacted by taking the offensive, stealthily [[Battle of Trenton|crossing the Delaware]] on [[Christmas]] night and capturing nearly 1,000 Hessians at the [[Battle of Trenton]] on [[December 26]], [[1776]]. Cornwallis marched to retake Trenton, but was outmaneuvered by Washington, who successfully [[Battle of Princeton|attacked the British rearguard]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] on [[January 3]], [[1777]]. Washington then entered winter quarters at [[Morristown, New Jersey]], having retaken much of New Jersey, and having secured two bold, morale-boosting victories in quick succession to reinvigorate the flagging revolution.

=== Saratoga Campaign, 1777 ===
In the summer of [[1777]], the British launched [[Saratoga Campaign|a new expedition]] from Canada. Led by General Burgoyne, the intention was to seize the Lake Champlain and Hudson River corridor, effectively isolating [[New England]] from the rest of the American colonies. Burgoyne's invasion had two components: he would lead about 10,000 men along Lake Champlain towards [[Albany, New York]], while a second column of about 2,000 men, led by [[Barry St. Leger]], would move down the [[Mohawk River]] valley and link up with Burgoyne in Albany.

Burgoyne set off in early July, [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1777)|recapturing Fort Ticonderoga]] from the retreating Revolutionaries without firing a shot. He then proceeded overland towards Albany, but Revolutionaries slowed his progress through the wilderness by destroying bridges and felling trees in his path. Running short on supplies, in August Burgoyne sent a detachment to raid nearby [[Bennington (town), Vermont|Bennington, Vermont]]. The raiders were [[Battle of Bennington|decisively defeated]] by local militia, depriving Burgoyne of nearly 1,000 men and the much-needed supplies.

[[Image:Joseph Brant painting by George Romney 1776.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] leader [[Joseph Brant]] commanded both American Indians and [[whites|white]] [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] during the American Revolutionary War.]]

Meanwhile, St. Leger‚Äîhalf of his force American Indians led by [[Joseph Brant]]‚Äîhad laid siege to [[Fort Stanwix]] on the Mohawk River. About 800 Revolutionary militiamen and their Indian allies marched to relieve the siege, but were ambushed and scattered by British and Indians on [[August 6]] at the [[Battle of Oriskany]]. [[Iroquois]] warriors fought on both sides of the battle, marking the beginning of a civil war within the Six Nations. When a second relief expedition approached, this time led by [[Benedict Arnold]], the siege was lifted, and St. Leger's expedition returned to Canada. Burgoyne was on his own.

Burgoyne pushed on towards Albany, his forces now reduced to about 6,000 men. A Revolutionary army of about 8,000 men, commanded by the newly arrived General [[Horatio Gates]], had entrenched about 10 miles (16 km) south of [[Saratoga, New York]]. Burgoyne sent 2,000 men to outflank the Revolutionary position, but was checked by Generals Benedict Arnold and [[Daniel Morgan]] in the [[Battle of Freeman's Farm|first battle of Saratoga]] on [[September 19]], [[1777]]. After the battle, the two armies dug in.

Burgoyne was in trouble now, but he hoped that help from the south might be on the way. All along, Burgoyne had suggested that his invasion from Canada might be supported by a British offensive up the Hudson River from Howe's location in New York City. However, [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|British war planners]] did not coordinate their efforts. General Howe had instead sailed away from New York on an expedition to capture Philadelphia (see next section). British General Henry Clinton, left in command at New York, did indeed sail up the Hudson in October, capturing several forts and burning [[Kingston (city), New York|Kingston]] (then the rebel capital of New York), but his efforts were not enough to affect the events at Saratoga.

Revolutionary militiamen, many of them outraged by the reported murder of [[Jane McCrae|an American woman]] at the hands of Burgoyne's Indian allies, flocked to Gates's army, swelling his force to 11,000 by the beginning of October. Burgoyne, his position becoming desperate, launched a new offensive, the [[Battle of Bemis Heights|second battle of Saratoga]] on October 7. The attack was repelled, and General Arnold, though relieved of command by Gates, rushed to the battle and led a decisive counterattack. Badly beaten, Burgoyne surrendered on October 17.

Saratoga is often regarded as the turning point of the war. Revolutionary confidence and determination, suffering from Howe's successful occupation of Philadelphia, was renewed. Even more importantly, the victory encouraged France to enter the war against Great Britain. Spain and the Netherlands soon did the same. For the British, the war had now become much more complicated.

=== Philadelphia campaign, 1777 to 1778 ===
Having secured New York City in his 1776 campaign, in 1777 General Howe concentrated on capturing Philadelphia, the seat of the Revolutionary government. He moved slowly, landing 15,000 troops in late August at the northern end of [[Chesapeake Bay]], about 55 miles (90 km) southwest of Philadelphia. Washington positioned his 11,000 men between Howe and Philadelphia, but was outflanked and driven back at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on [[September 11]], [[1777]]. The Continental Congress once again abandoned the city. British and Revolutionary forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days, clashing in minor encounters such as the so-called &quot;[[Paoli Massacre]].&quot; On September 26, Howe finally outmaneuvered Washington and marched into Philadelphia unopposed.

After taking the city, the British [[garrison]]ed about 9,000 troops in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], five miles (8 km) above Philadelphia. Washington [[Battle of Germantown| unsuccessfully attacked Germantown]] in early October, and then retreated to watch and wait. Meanwhile, the British secured the Delaware River by taking (with difficulty) forts [[Fort Mifflin|Mifflin]] and [[Fort Mercer|Mercer]] in November.

General Washington's problems at this time were not just with the British. In the so-called [[Conway Cabal]], some politicians and officers unhappy with Washington's recent performance as commander-in-chief secretively discussed his removal. Washington, offended by the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, laid the whole matter openly before Congress. His supporters rallied behind him, and the episode abated.

Washington and his army encamped at [[Valley Forge]] in December 1777, about 20 miles (32 km) from Philadelphia, where they would stay for the next six months. Over the winter, 2,500 men (out of 10,000) died from disease and exposure. However, the army eventually emerged from Valley Forge in good order, thanks in part to a training program supervised by [[Baron von Steuben]].

Meanwhile, there was a shakeup in the British command, with General Clinton replacing Howe as commander-in-chief. French entry into the war had changed British war strategy, and Clinton was ordered by the government to abandon Philadelphia and defend New York City, now vulnerable to French naval power.

Washington's army shadowed Clinton on his withdrawal, and forced a [[Battle of Monmouth|battle at Monmouth]] on [[June 28]], [[1778]], the last major battle in the North. Washington's second-in-command, General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], ordered a controversial retreat during the battle, allowing Clinton's army to escape. By July, Clinton was in New York City, and Washington was again at White Plains. Both armies were back where they had been two years earlier. With the exception of scattered minor actions in the North, like the [[Battle of Stony Point]], the focus of the war now shifted elsewhere.

== War in the West ==
''Main article: [[Frontier warfare during the American Revolution]]''

[[Image:Ftsackville.gif|thumb|250px|left|[[George Rogers Clark]]'s 180 mile (290 km) trek in the dead of winter led to the capture of General [[Henry Hamilton]], Lieutenant-Governor of [[Canada]].]]

West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the American Revolutionary War was an &quot;[[Indian Wars|Indian War]].&quot; The British and the Continental Congress both courted [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] as allies (or urged them to remain neutral), and many Native American communities became divided over what path to take. Like the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, tribes such as the [[Cherokee]]s and the [[Shawnee]]s split into factions. [[Lenape|Delaware]]s under [[White Eyes]] signed the [[Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778)|first American Indian treaty]] with the United States, but other Delawares joined the British.

The British supplied their Indian allies from forts along the Great Lakes, and tribesmen staged raids on Revolutionary settlements in New York, [[Kentucky]], Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Joint Iroquois-Loyalist attacks in the [[Wyoming Valley Massacre|Wyoming Valley]] and at [[Cherry Valley Massacre|Cherry Valley]] in 1778 helped provoke the [[scorched earth]] [[Sullivan Expedition]] into western New York during the summer of 1779. On the western front, every man, woman, and child‚Äîregardless of race‚Äîwas a potential casualty.

In the [[Ohio Country]], the [[Virginia]] [[frontier|frontiersman]] [[George Rogers Clark]] attempted to neutralize British influence among the Ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] and [[Battle of Vincennes|Vincennes]] in the summer of 1778. When General [[Henry Hamilton]], the British commander at [[Detroit]], retook Vincennes, Clark returned in a surprise march in February 1779 and captured Hamilton himself.

However, a decisive victory in the West eluded the United States even as their fortunes had risen in the East. The low point on the frontier came in 1782 with the [[Gnadenhutten massacre]], when Pennsylvania militiamen‚Äîunable to track down enemy warriors‚Äîexecuted nearly 100 [[Christian]] Delaware [[noncombatant]]s, mostly women and children. Later that year, in the last major encounter of the war, a party of Kentuckians was [[Battle of Blue Licks|soundly defeated]] by a superior force of British regulars and Native Americans.

== War in the South ==
During the first three years of the American Revolutionary War, the primary military encounters were in the North. One notable exception was in June 1776, when General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] sailed south to attack [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. This ended in humiliating defeat for the British, and the Patriots remained in control of the southern states for the next three years. Starting in 1778, the British once again turned their attention to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]], where they hoped to regain control by recruiting thousands of Loyalists.

On [[December 29]], [[1778]], an expeditionary corps of 3,500 men from Clinton's army in New York captured [[Savannah, Georgia]]. An attempt by French and Revolutionary forces to [[Siege of Savannah|retake Savannah]] failed on [[October 9]], [[1779]]. In this assault, Count [[Casimir Pulaski]], the [[Poland|Polish]] commander of American Revolutionary [[cavalry]], was mortally wounded. With Savannah secured, Clinton could now launch a new assault on Charleston, South Carolina, where he had failed in 1776.

=== Carolinas, 1780 to 1781 ===
[[Image:General_Sir_Banastre_Tarleton_by_Sir_Joshua_Reynolds.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The young and dashing [[Banastre Tarleton]] was perhaps the best cavalry commander in the war‚Äîand the most hated man in the South. This portrait was painted by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1782.]]

Clinton finally moved against Charleston in 1780, blockading the harbor in March, and building up about 10,000 troops in the area. Inside the city, General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] commanded about 2,650 Continentals and 2,500 militiamen. When British [[Colonel]] [[Banastre Tarleton]] cut off the city's supply lines in victories at [[Monck's Corner]] in April and [[Lenud's Ferry]] in early May, Charleston was surrounded.

On [[May 12]], [[1780]], General Lincoln surrendered his 5,000 men‚Äîthe largest surrender of U.S. troops until the [[American Civil War]]. With relatively few casualties, Clinton had seized the South‚Äôs biggest city and seaport, winning perhaps the greatest British victory of the war, and paving the way for what seemed like certain conquest of the South.

The remnants of the southern Continental Army began to withdraw to [[North Carolina]], but were pursued by Colonel Tarleton, who defeated them at the [[Waxhaw Massacre|Battle of Waxhaws]] on [[May 29]], [[1780]]. Among the Americans , a story spread that Tarleton had massacred many Americans after they had surrendered (the truth of this charge is still debated). ‚ÄúBloody Tarleton‚Äù became a hated name, and ‚ÄúTarleton‚Äôs quarter‚Äù‚Äîreferring to his reputed lack of mercy (or ‚Äúquarter‚Äù)‚Äîsoon became a rallying cry.

With these events, organized American military activity in the South had collapsed.  The states however carried on their functions, and the war was carried on by partisans such as [[Francis Marion]]. General Clinton turned over British operations in the South to Lord Cornwallis. The Continental Congress dispatched General [[Horatio Gates]], to the rescue with a new army. But Gates promptly suffered one of the worst defeats in U.S. military history at the [[Battle of Camden]] on [[August 16]], [[1780]], setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.

The tables were quickly turned on Cornwallis, however. One wing of his army was utterly defeated at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] on [[October 7]], [[1780]], delaying his move into North Carolina. Kings Mountain was noteworthy because it was not a battle between British redcoats and colonial troops: it was a battle between American Loyalists and American Patriots.  The British plan to raise large Loyalist armies failed; not enough Loyalists enlisted, and those who did were at risk once the British army moved on.  Only in Georgia did the Crown manage to create a counter-revolutionary civil government.

Gates was replaced by George Washington's most dependable subordinate, General [[Nathanael Greene]]. Greene assigned about 1,000 men to General [[Daniel Morgan]], a superb tactician who crushed Tarleton‚Äôs troops at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on [[January 17]], [[1781]]. Greene proceeded to wear down his opponents in a series of battles ([[Battle of Guilford Court House|Guilford Court House]], [[Battle of Hobkirk's Hill|Hobkirk's Hill]], [[Battle of Ninety Six|Ninety Six]], and [[Battle of Eutaw Springs|Eutaw Springs]]), each of them tactically a victory for the British, but giving no strategic advantage to the victors. Greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous: &quot;We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.&quot; Unable to capture or destroy Greene's army, Cornwallis moved north to to Virginia.

=== Virginia, 1775 to 1781 ===
Virginia had been under revolutionary control since Loyalist forces (including runaway slaves) under [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Governor Dunmore]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of Great Bridge]] on [[December 9]], [[1775]]. After the defeat, Dunmore and his troops took refuge on British ships off of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], which Dunmore bombarded and burned on [[January 1]], [[1776]]. He was driven from an island in [[Chesapeake Bay]] that summer, never to return.

British forces raided Virginia sporadically during the war. In January 1781, the rebel capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was put to the torch by none other than Benedict Arnold, now a turncoat, who had sold his services to the other side and was now a British general.

In March 1781, General Washington dispatched [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] to defend Virginia. The young Frenchman had 3,200 men at his command, but British troops in the state, now reinforced and commanded by Cornwallis, totaled 7,200. Lafayette skirmished with Cornwallis, avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements. &quot;The boy cannot escape me,&quot; Cornwallis is supposed to have said. However, Cornwallis was unable to trap Lafayette, and so he moved his forces to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] in July in order to link up with the British navy.

Meanwhile the co-operation of the French became active.  In July [[Comte de Rochambeau|Count Rochambeau]] arrived at Newport, Rhode Island.  That place had been occupied by the British from 1776 to the close of 1779.  An unsuccessful attempt was made to drive them out in 1778 by the Revolutionaries assisted by the French admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] and a French corps.

===Gulf Coast===
After Spain declared war against Great Britain in June of 1779, Count [[Bernardo de G√°lvez]], the Spanish governor of [[Louisiana]], seized three British [[Mississippi River]] outposts: [[Battle of Fort Bute|Manchac]], [[Battle of Baton Rouge|Baton Rouge]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]. G√°lvez then captured [[Battle of Fort Charlotte|Mobile]] on [[March 14]], [[1780]], and, in May of 1781, [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)|forced the surrender]] of the British outpost at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. On [[May 8]], [[1782]], G√°lvez captured the British naval base at New Providence in the Bahamas. Galvez also supplied  soldiers to George Rogers Clark and had been supplying substantial quantities of war supplies to the American rebels from as early as 1777.

===Caribbean===
The [[Battle of the Saintes]] took place in 1782, during the American War of Independence, and was a victory of a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] fleet under Admiral Sir [[George Rodney]] over a [[France|French]] fleet under the [[Comte de Grasse]].  The defeat dashed the hopes of France and Spain to take [[Jamaica]] and other colonies from the British.

===India===
The Franco-British war spilled over into [[India]] in 1780, in the form of the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]]. The two chief combatants were [[Tipu Sultan]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and a key French ally, and the British government of [[Madras Presidency|Madras]]. The Anglo-Mysore conflict was bloody but inconclusive, and ended in a draw at the [[Treaty of Mangalore]] in 1784.

===Netherlands===
Also in 1780, the British struck against the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] of the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] to preempt Dutch involvement in the [[League of Armed Neutrality]], directed primarily against the British Navy during the war. Agitation by Dutch radicals and a friendly attitude towards the United States by the Dutch government, both influenced by the American Revolution, also encouraged the British to attack.

The war lasted into 1784 and was disastrous to the Dutch mercantile economy.

===Mediterranean===
On [[February 5]], [[1782]], Spanish and French forces captured [[Minorca]], which had been under British control since the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713.  A further Franco-Spanish effort to recover [[Gibraltar]] was unsuccessful.  Minorca was ceded to Spain in the peace treaty.

=== Whitehaven ===
An interesting footnote to this war was the actual landing on [[Britain]] itself of a ship from the U.S. [[Navy]]. This occurred in 1778 when the port of [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumberland]] was raided by [[John Paul Jones]]. The landing was a surprise attack, taken as an action of revenge by Jones, and was never intended as an invasion. Nevertheless, it caused hysteria in [[England]], with the attack showing a weakness that could be exploited by other states such as [[France]] or [[Spain]]. Its result was an intense period of fortification in British ports.

== War's end ==
The northern, southern, and naval theaters of the war converged at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] in 1781. On [[September 5]], [[1781]], French naval forces defeated the British [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], cutting off Cornwallis's supplies and transport. Washington hurriedly moved his troops from [[New York]], and a combined Franco-American force of 17,000 troops commenced the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]] on [[October 6]], [[1781]]. Cornwallis's position quickly became untenable, and on [[October 19]] his army surrendered. The war was all but over.

Despite the painting's title, Cornwallis (claiming illness) was not present and is not depicted. [[George Washington|Washington]] is on horseback in the right background; because the British commander was absent, military protocol dictated that Washington have a subordinate‚Äîin this case [[Benjamin Lincoln]]‚Äîaccept the surrender.]]

[[British Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]] resigned soon after hearing the news from Yorktown. In April 1782, the [[British House of Commons]] voted to end the war in America. On [[November 30]], [[1782]] preliminary peace articles were signed in [[Paris]]; the formal end of the war did not occur until the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on [[September 3]], [[1783]] and the United States Congress ratified the treaty on [[January 14]], [[1784]]. The last [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British troops left]] [[New York City]] on [[November 25]], [[1783]].

The reasons for Great Britain's misfortunes and defeat may be summarized as follows: Misconception by the home government of the temper and reserve strength of her colonists; disbelief at the outset in the probability of a protracted struggle covering the immense territory in America; consequent failure of the British to use their more efficient military strength effectively; the safe and [[Fabian Strategy|Fabian generalship]] of Washington; and perhaps most significantly, the French alliance and European combinations by which at the close of the conflict left Great Britain without a friend or ally on the continent.

Decisive victory eluded the United States on the western frontier. Great Britain negotiated the Paris peace treaty without consulting her Indian allies, however, and ceded much American Indian territory to the United States. Full of resentment, Native Americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the United States in a series of treaties, but the result was essentially an armed truce‚Äîthe fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier, the largest being the [[Northwest Indian War]].

===Casualties===
The total loss of life resulting from the American Revolutionary War is unknown. As was typical in the wars of the era, disease claimed more lives than battle. The war took place in the context of a massive [[smallpox]] [[North American smallpox epidemic|epidemic]] in North America that probably killed more than 130,000 people. Historian [[Joseph J. Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[inoculation|inoculated]] may have been the commander-in-chief's most important strategic decision.{{ref|smallpox}}

Casualty figures for the American Revolutionaries have varied over the years; a recent scholarly estimate lists 6,824 killed and 8,445 wounded in action. The number of Revolutionary troop deaths from disease and other non-combat causes is estimated at about 18,500.{{ref|casualties}}

Approximately 1,200 Germans were killed in action and 6,354 died from illness or accident. About 16,000 of the remaining German troops returned home, but roughly 5,500 remained in the United States after the war for various reasons, many becoming American citizens. No reliable statistics exist for the number of casualties among other groups, including American Loyalists, British regulars, American Indians, French and Spanish troops, and civilians.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the different meanings of [[Amp√®re]], see the disambiguation page.''
----

The '''ampere''' (symbol: A) is the [[SI base unit]] of [[electric current]] equal to one [[coulomb]] per second.  It is named after [[Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re]], one of the main discoverers of [[electromagnetism]].

==Definition==
The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 [[metre]] apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2{{e|‚Äì7}} [[newton]] per metre of length.

==Explanation==
Because it is a base unit, the definition of the ampere is not tied to any other electrical unit. The definition for the ampere is equivalent to fixing a value of the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of vacuum to ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 4&amp;pi;{{e|&amp;minus;7}} H/m. Prior to 1948, the so-called &quot;international ampere&quot; was used, defined in terms of the [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] deposition rate of [[silver]]. The older unit is equal to 0.999&amp;nbsp;85&amp;nbsp;A.

The ampere is most accurately realised using an [[ampere balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's Law]] from the units of [[voltage]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.

The unit of [[electric charge]], the [[coulomb]], is defined in terms of the ampere: one coulomb is the amount of electric charge (formerly [[quantity of electricity]]) carried in a current of one ampere flowing for one [[second]]. [[Current (electricity)]], then, is the rate at which charge flows through a wire or surface. One ampere of current (I) is equal to a flow of one [[coulomb]] of charge (Q) per second of time (t):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I=Q/t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since a coulomb is approximately equal to 6.24{{e|18}} elementary charges, one ampere is equivalent to 6.24{{e|18}} elementary charges, such as [[electron]]s, moving through a surface in one second. More precisely, using the SI definitions for the conventional values of the [[Josephson constant|Josephson]] and [[von Klitzing constant|von Klitzing]] constants, the ampere can be defined as exactly 6.241&amp;nbsp;509&amp;nbsp;629&amp;nbsp;152&amp;nbsp;65{{e|18}} elementary charges per second.

;''n''-''m'' defense:a defense with ''n'' down linemen and ''m'' linebackers, such as:

:;3-3: a defense with 3 lineman, 3 linebackers, and 5 defensive backs. Often called a '''3-3 stack.'''
:;3-4 defense:a [[defensive team | defensive]] formation with 3 [[lineman (football)|linemen]] and 4 linebackers. A professional derivative in the 1970's of the earlier [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] or '''&quot;50&quot; defense''', which had 5 linemen and 2 linebackers.  The 3-4 outside linebackers resemble &quot;stand-up ends&quot; in the older defense.
:;4-3 defense:a defensive formation with 4 linemen and 3 linebackers. Several variations are employed.  First used by coach [[Joe Kuharich]].
:;4-6 defense :(pronounced ''four-six defense'') a defense with four (4) down linemen and six (6) linebackers
;[[46 defense]] :(pronounced ''forty-six defense'') a formation of the 4-3 defense (four linemen and three linebackers) in which three defensive backs (the two cornerbacks and the strong safety) crowd the line of scrimmage. The remaining safety, which is the free safety, stays in the backfield. It is also known as the &quot;Bear&quot; defense because it was popularized by [[Buddy Ryan]] while coaching for the [[Chicago Bears]]. Not to be confused with the 4-6 (four-six) defense.
;50 defense  :a once popular college defense with 5 defensive linemen and 2 linebackers.

;audible: (from [[Latin]] ''aud&amp;#299;re'' = to hear, to listen to) a play called by the quarterback at the line of scrimmage to change the play that was called in the huddle.
;automatic :see [[#A|audible]]
;automatic first down: for several of the most severe penalties, including '''pass interference''' and all personal fouls, a first down is rewarded to the offensive team even if the yardage of that penalty is less than the yardage needed for a first down.

==B==
;back :A [[American and Canadian football position names|position]] behind the offensive line, or behind the linebackers on defense.
;[[blitz (American football)|blitz]] :a defensive maneuver in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs, who normally remain behind the line of scrimmage, instead charge into the opponents' backfield.  However, in the 3-4 defense, one linebacker typically rushes the passer with the three down linemen.  This is not considered a blitz.  If an additional linebacker is sent, bringing the total number of rushers to five, it is a blitz.
;[[blocking (American football)|blocking]] :when a player obstructs another player's path with his body.
;[[bootleg play|bootleg]] :an offensive play predicated upon misdirection in which the quarterback pretends to hand the ball to another player, and then carries the ball in the opposite direction of the supposed ballcarrier with the intent of either passing or running (sometimes the quarterback has the option of doing either).  A '''naked bootleg''' is a risky variation of this play when the quarterback has no blockers pulling out with him.  Contrast with '''scramble''', '''sneak''', and '''draw'''
;the box :an area on the defensive side of the ball, directly opposite the offensive linemen and about 5 yards deep; having 8 players in the box means bringing in a defensive back, normally the strong safety, to help stop the offensive team's running game

==C==
;[[Center (American football)|center]] :a player [[American and Canadian football position names|position]] on [[offensive team|offense]]. The center snaps the ball.
;centre :Canadian &quot;center&quot;
;chains :the 10-yard long chain that is used by the [[chain crew]] to measure for a new series of downs.
;check-off: see [[#A|audible]]
;chuck and duck : a style of offense with minimal pass protection requiring the Quarterback to &quot;chuck&quot; the ball then &quot;duck&quot; to avoid a defensive lineman.  
;clipping :an illegal block in which the victim is blocked from the back and below the waist; the penalty is 15 yards. Originally, clipping was defined as any block from the back, but is now restricted to blocks below the waist. Other blocks from the back are now punished with 10-yard penalties.
;coffin corner :the corner of the field of play. A punter, if he is close enough, will often attempt to kick the ball out of bounds close to the receiving team's goal line and pin them back near their own end zone.
;contain :a defensive assignment.  On outside runs such as the sweep, one defensive player (usually a [[cornerback]] or outside linebacker) is assigned to keep the rusher from getting to the edge of the play and turning upfield.  If executed properly, the rusher will have to turn upfield before the play calls for it, giving the linebackers a better chance of stopping the play for little or no gain.
;[[cornerback]] (CB):a [[defensive back]] who lines up near the line of scrimmage across from a '''wide receiver'''. Their primary job is to disrupt passing routes and to defend against short and medium passes in the passing game, and to contain the rusher on rushing plays.
;counter :a running play in which the running back will take a step in the apparent direction of the play (ie, the direction the line is moving), only to get the handoff in the other direction.  '''Weak side''' linemen will sometimes '''pull''' and lead the back downfield (sometimes called a '''counter trap'''), but not necessarily.  The play is designed to get the defense to flow away from the action for a few steps as they follow the linemen, allowing more room for the running back.
;crackback block :an illegal block delivered below the opponent's waist by an offensive player who had left the area of close line play and then returned to it, or was not within it at the snap. The term is also used to describe a legal block (delivered from the front, or from the side with the offensive player's helmet in front of the blocked player) by a wide receiver on a player who lined up inside of him.
;cut
# a sharp change of direction by a running player. Also called a [[Cutback (football move)|cutback]].
# see &quot;cut blocking&quot; below
;cut blocking: a blocking technique in which offensive linemen, and sometimes other blockers, block legally below the waist (i.e., from the front of the defensive player) in an attempt to bring the defenders to ground, making them unable to pursue a running back for the short time needed for the back to find a gap in the defense. The technique is somewhat controversial, as it carries a risk of serious leg injuries to the blocked defenders. The [[NFL]]'s [[Denver Broncos]] are especially famous (or infamous) for using this technique.

==D==
;[[dead ball]] :a ball which is no longer in play.
;[[defensive back]] :a cornerback or safety [[American_and_Canadian_football_position_names|position]] on the defensive team; commonly defends against wide receivers on passing plays.  Generally there are 4 defensive backs playing at a time; but see '''nickel back''' and '''dime back'''.

;[[defensive tackle]] (DT):a player [[American_and_Canadian_football_position_names|position]] on [[defensive team| defense]] on the inside of the defensive line. When a defensive tackle lines up directly across from the center, he is known often as a [[nose tackle]].
;[[defensive team]] :the team that begins a play from scrimmage not in possession of the ball.
;[[dime back]] :the second extra, or sixth total, defensive back.  Named because a [[dime (U.S. coin)|dime]] has the same value as two [[nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]]s.
;double reverse: a play in which the ball reverses direction twice behind the line of scrimmage.  This is usually accomplished by means of two or three hand-offs, each hand-off going in an opposite direction as the previous one. Such a play is extremely infrequent in football.

:Some people confuse the ''double reverse'' with a ''reverse'', which is a play with two hand-offs instead of three.
;[[down (football)| down]] :one of a series of plays in which the offensive team must advance at least 10 yards or lose possession. '''First down''' is the first of the plays; fourth is the last down in American, and third in Canadian, football. A first down occurs after a change of possession of the ball, after advancing the ball 10 yards following a previous first down or after certain penalties.
;down lineman: a player stationed in front of his line of scrimmage and who has either one (three-point stance) or two (four-point stance) hands on the ground.
;[[draw play]] :a play in which the quarterback drops back as if to pass, then hands off to a running back or runs with the ball himself. Contrast with '''scramble'''

;[[drop kick]] :a kick in which the ball is dropped and kicked once it hits the ground and before it hits it again; a half-volley kick.

==E==
;[[eligible receiver]]s :players who may legally touch a forward pass. On the passer's team, these are: the '''ends''' (see below), the '''backs''', and (except in the NFL), one player in position to take a hand-to-hand '''snap''', i.e. a T '''quarterback'''; provided the player's shirt displays a number in the ranges allowed for eligible receivers. All players of the opposing team are eligible receivers, and once the ball is touched by a player of the opposing team (anywhere in American, or beyond the lines of scrimmage in Canadian football), all players become eligible.
;encroachment: an illegal action by a player: to cross the [[line of scrimmage]] and make contact with an opponent before the ball is snapped, or to line up offside and remain there when the ball is put in play.
;[[End (football)|end]] :a player [[American and Canadian football position names|position]], either on [[offensive team| offense]] or [[defensive team| defense]] -- see '''linemen'''.
;[[end zone]] :the area between the end line (or deadline in Canadian amateur football) and the goal line, bounded by the sidelines.
;[[extra point]] :a single point scored in a conversion attempt by making what would be a field goal or a safety during general play.

==F==
;[[fair catch]] :An unhindered catch of an opponent's kick. The player wanting to make one must signal for a fair catch by waving an arm overhead while the ball is in the air.  After that signal, if he gains possession of the ball it is dead immediately and opponents will receive a fifteen yard penalty for hitting him.
;[[fantasy football (American)]] :A game in which the participants (called &quot;owners&quot;) each draft on their own or with the aid of software [http://www.thecoordinator.com] a team of real-life NFL players and then score points based on those players' statistical performance on the field.
;field of play: the area between both the goal lines and the sidelines, and in some contexts the space vertically above it.
;[[field goal]] :score of 3 points made by place- or drop-kicking the ball through the opponent's goal other than via a kickoff or free kick following a safety; formerly, &quot;goal from the field&quot;.

;formation :An arrangement of the offensive skill players.  A formation usually is described in terms of how the running backs line up (e.g. [[I formation]], which refers to the half back is lined up about 7 yard deep, and the fullback is lined up about 5 yards deep, both directly behind the quarterback) or how the wide receivers line up (e.g. Trips left, in which three wide receivers line up to the left of the linemen).  Frequently, the formation will allude to both, such as with Strong I Slot Right, in which the halfback is lined up 7 yards deep behind the quarterback, the fullback is 5 yards deep behind the guard or tackle on the strong side, and both wide receivers are lined up on the right side of the offensive line.There are rules limiting what is legal in a formation.  All five offensive linemen must be on the line of scrimage (a small amount of leeway is given to tackles when lined up for pass protection).  Also, there must be one receiver (usally one tight end and one wide receiver) lined up on the line on either side of the offensive line (it doesn't matter how close they are to the tackles, as long as they are on the line).  A receiver who is on the line may not go in motion.
;[[forward pass]] :a pass that touches a person, object, or the ground closer to the opponent's end line than where it was released from, or is accidentally lost during a forward throwing motion.
;four-point stance: a down lineman's stance with four points on the ground, in other words, his two feet and his two hands

;free safety (FS):a player [[American_and_Canadian_football_position_names|position]] on [[defensive team|defense]]. Free safeties typically play deep, or &quot;center field&quot;, and often have the pass defense responsibility of assisting other defensive backs in deep coverage (compared to strong safeties, who usually have an assigned receiver and run support responsibilities).
;[[fullback#American_football|fullback]] (FB):a player [[American_and_Canadian_football_position_names|position]] on [[offensive team| offense]].  Originally, lined up deep behind the '''quarterback''' in the '''T formation'''.  In modern formations this position may be varied, and this player has more blocking responsibilities in comparison to the '''halfback''' or '''tailback'''.
;[[fumble]] :a ball that a player accidentally lost possession of; in Canadian football the term includes muffs.

==G==
;[[Goal line|goal]] :a surface in space marked by a structure of two upright posts 18 feet 6 inches apart extending above a horizontal crossbar whose top edge is 10 feet off the ground.

;[[halfback option play]] :a trick play in which the halfback throws a pass.
;halo violation : From 1983 until the end of the 2002 season, in the NCAA (college football) the halo rule was a penalty for interference with the opportunity to catch a kick.  The so called '''halo''' rule stated that no player of the kicking team may be within two yards of a receiving team player positioned to catch a punt or kickoff (before that person has touched the ball).  The rule was abolished beginning in the 2003 season.  
;hand-off :(also known as backward pass) a player's handing of a live ball to another player. The hand-off goes either backwards or laterally, as opposed to a forward pass. Sometimes called a &quot;switch&quot; in touch football.  (Note different usage of term from its rugby meaning.)

;huddle :an on-field gathering of members of a team in order to secretly communicate instructions for the upcoming play.

==I==
;[[I formation]] :A formation that includes a '''fullback''' and '''tailback''' lined up with the fullback directly in front of the tailback.

;[[incomplete pass]] :a forward pass of the ball which no player legally caught.
;inbounds lines :the hash marks.
;inside :
# of a player's path: relatively close (in reference to the sides of the field) to where the ball was snapped from. Thus, a ballcarrier's path in crossing the neutral zone may be said to be &quot;inside&quot; of an opponent, or an &quot;inside run&quot; in general, and a rushing defensive player may be said to put on an &quot;inside move&quot; or &quot;inside rush&quot;.
# of the movement of the ball between players: directed toward a player who cuts between a player in the backfield who throws or hands the ball and the place from which it was snapped. Thus, an &quot;inside pass&quot; or &quot;inside handoff&quot;. An &quot;inside reverse&quot; (sometimes called a scissors play) is a reverse play via an inside handoff.

==J==
;[[I formation#Common variations|Jumbo]] :an offensive package which includes two tight ends, a full back and a half back.  Similar to '''heavy jumbo''', in which either the half back or the fullback is replaced by another tight end.  Often one or more of the &quot;tight ends&quot; is actually a linebacker (The New England Patriots use Mike Vrabel this way - he has 6 career regular season TDs) or offensive linemen.  In these cases, the player must report in as an eligible receiver, whereas a tight end is assumed to be one.

==K==
;kick :as a verb, to strike the ball deliberately with the foot; as a noun, such an action producing a [[Punt kick|punt]], [[place kick]], or [[drop kick]]
;[[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] :a free kick which starts each half, or restarts the game following a touchdown or field goal. The kickoff may be a place kick in American or Canadian football, or a drop kick in American football.

;[[linebacker]] :a player [[American and Canadian football position names|position]] on [[defensive team| defense]].  The linebackers typically play 1 to 3 yards behind the defensive '''linemen''' and have both run and pass defense responsibilities.  However they are often called on to '''blitz''', and in some formations a linebacker may be designated as a &quot;rush linebacker&quot;, rushing the passer on almost every play.
;[[lineman (football)|lineman]] :a [[defensive team|defensive]] or [[offensive team|offensive]] [[American and Canadian football position names|position]] on the line of scrimmage.  
*On offense, the player snapping the ball is the '''center'''.  The players on either side of him are the '''guard'''s, and the players to the outside of him are the '''tackle'''s.  The players on the end of the line are the '''end'''s.  This may be varied in an '''unbalanced line'''.

==M==
;man coverage :same as man-to-man coverage

In Canadian football, more than one back can be in motion, and may move in any direction as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage at the snap.
;man-to-man coverage :a defense in which all players in pass coverage, typically linebackers and defensive backs, cover a specific player. Pure man coverage is very rare; defenses typically mix man and zone coverage.

;running play: a play where the offense attempts to advance the ball without passing.
;[[rush (American football) | rush]] :trying to tackle or hurry a player before he can throw a pass or make a kick

The term gained currency ca. 1970.
;safety
#a player position on [[defensive team|defense]] -- see '''free safety''' and '''strong safety'''.
#a method of scoring (worth two points) by downing an opposing ballcarrier in his own end zone, forcing the opposing ballcarrier out of his own end zone AND out of bounds, or forcing the offensive team to fumble the ball so that it exits the end zone. A safety is also awarded if the offensive team commits a penalty within its own end zone. After a safety, the team that was scored upon must kick the ball to the scoring team from its own 20-yard line.&lt;br&gt;A safety scored during a try scores 1 point and is followed by a kickoff as for any other try.
;safety valve :a receiver whose job it is to get open for a short pass in case all other receivers are covered.
;sam :the ''s''trong side outside linebacker
;scramble :on a called passing play, when the quarterback runs from the pocket in an attempt to avoid being sacked, giving the receivers more time to get open or attempting to gain positive yards by running himself.
;[[screen pass]] :a short forward pass to a receiver who has blockers in front of him. The receiver in this play is usually a running back, although wide receiver and tight end screens are also used.  Although the are both called screen passes, the wide receiver screen and the running back screen are used for very different reasons.  In the case of a running back screen, the play is designed to allow the pass rushers by the offensive linemen, leaving the defender out of position to make a play.  The play is usually employed to defuse the pass rush in the case of a running back screen.  The Wide Receiver screen is a much faster developing play, designed to catch the defense off guard.

;[[squib kick]] :a type of '''kickoff''' in which the ball is intentionally kicked low to the ground, typically bouncing on the ground a few times before being picked up. This is done in the hopes of preventing a long return, as the ball is often picked up by one of the '''upmen''' as opposed to the designated kickoff returner.
;sticks : the pole attached to the end of the 10-yard chain that is used by the [[chain crew]] to measure for a new series of downs -- i.e. the line to gain a new &quot;first down&quot;.
;stiff-arm or straight-arm :a ballcarrier warding off a would-be tackler by pushing them away with a straight arm.
;strong i :a formation wherein the tailback is lined up deep directly behind the quarterback, and the fullback is lined up offset to the strong side of the formation.
;strong safety (SS):a kind of safety on [[defensive team|defense]], as opposed to a free safety. This is a central defensive back; originally, the term indicated that he lined up on the strong side of the field and covered the tight end. However, the modern usage of the term now indicates a central defensive back with responsibility for run and pass support, slightly favoring run support. 
;strong side :simplistically speaking, the side of the field (left or right) that has the most players, but it depends on the formations of the teams. When a team uses one tight end, the strong side is the side of the field where the tight end lines up. If the offensive package uses no tight end, or more than one tight end, the strong side is the side of the field with the most offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage.
;[[stunt (football)|stunt]]:a tactic used by defensive linemen in which they switch roles in an attempt to get past the blockers.  Both defenders will start with power rushes, with the stunting defender getting more of a push.  The other lineman will then go around him, ideally using him as a pick to get free from his blocker.
;[[Sweep (American football)|sweep]] :a running play in which several blockers lead a running back on a designed play to the outside.  Depending on the number of blockers and the design of the play this is sometimes referred to as a &quot;power sweep&quot; or &quot;student-body-right&quot; (or left).

==T==
;[[T formation]] :a classic offensive formation with the quarterback directly behind the center and three running backs behind the quarterback, forming a 'T'.  Numerous variations have been developed including the split-T, wing-T, and wishbone-T.
;[[tackle (football)|tackle]]
*the act of forcing a ball carrier to the ground
*a player position on the line, either an [[offensive tackle]] or a [[defensive tackle]]-- see '''linemen'''.
;tackle box: the area between where the two [[offensive tackle]]s line up prior to the snap.
;[[tailback]] :player position on [[offensive team| offense]] farthest (&quot;deepest&quot;) back, except in kicking formations. Also often referred to as the '''running back''', particularly in a '''one-back offense'''.
;[[three-and-out]]: when an offensive team fails to gain a first down on the first three plays of a drive, and thus is forced to punt on fourth down.
;three-point stance: a down lineman's stance with three points on the ground, in another words, his two feet and one of his hands
;[[tight end]] :a player position on [[offensive team| offense]], an eligible receiver ligned up on the line of scrimmage, next to the offensive tackle.  Tight ends are used as blockers during running plays, and either run a route or stay in to block during passing plays.
;[[touchback]] :the act of downing the ball behind one's own goal line after the ball had been propelled over the goal by the opposing team. After a touchback, the team that downed it gets the ball at their own 20-yard line.
;touchdown :a play worth six points, accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent's end zone. It also allows the team a chance for one extra point by kicking the ball or a two point conversion; see &quot;try&quot; below.
;trap :a basic blocking pattern in which a defensive lineman is allowed past the line of scrimmage, only to be blocked at an angle by a &quot;pulling&quot; lineman. Designed to gain a preferred blocking angle and larger hole in the line.
;trips :a formation in which 3 wide receivers are lined up close to one another on the same side of the field.  Also refers to those receivers.  Used to create potential for confusion or collision between defenders as these receivers split up.
;[[two-point conversion]] :a play worth two points accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent's end zone after a touchdown has been made; see &quot;try&quot; below
;try :a scrimmage play, from close to their opponent's goal line, awarded to a team which has scored a touchdown, allowing them (and in some codes, their opponents) to score an additional 1 or 2 points; also called &quot;try-for-point&quot;, &quot;conversion&quot;, &quot;convert&quot; (Canadian), &quot;extra point(s)&quot;, &quot;point(s) after (touchdown)&quot; or PAT

==U==
;unbalanced line :usually refers to an offensive formation which does not have an equal number of '''linemen''' on each side of the ball.  Done to gain a blocking advantage on one side of the formation; typically one '''tackle''' or '''guard''' lines up on the other side of the ball.  For example a common alignment would be E-G-C-G-T-T-E.
;upman :during a kickoff, every player on the return team is called an &quot;upman&quot; with the exception of the one or two designated kickoff returners, who stand furthest away from the starting point of the kicking team.

==V==
;Veer :a type of '''option''' offense using 2 backs in the backfield, one behind each guard or tackle (referred to as split backs), allowing a triple option play (give to either back or quarterback keep).

==W==
;weak i :a formation wherein the tailback is lined up deep directly behind the quarterback, and the fullback is lined up offset to the weak side of the formation.
;weak side :when one tight end is used, the side of the field opposite the tight end. In other offensive packages, the side of the field with the fewest offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage.
;[[West Coast offense]] :an [[Offensive philosophy (American football)|offensive philosophy]] that uses short, high-percentage passes as the core of a ball-control offense.  Widely used but originally made popular by [[San Francisco 49ers]] coach [[Bill Walsh (football coach)|Bill Walsh]].  A main component of the west coast offense is use of all the eligible receivers in the short passing game.
;[[wide receiver]] :a player [[American_and_Canadian_football_position_names|position]] on [[offensive team| offense]].  He is split wide (usually about 10 yards) from the formation and plays on the line of scrimmage as a '''split end''' or one yard off as a '''flanker'''.
;will :the ''w''eak side linebacker 
;wing back :a player [[American_and_Canadian_football_position_names|position]] in some [[offensive team| offensive]] formations.  Lines up just outside the '''tight end''' and one yard off the '''line of scrimmage'''.  May be a receiver but is more typically used as a blocking back.
;'''[[wishbone formation|wishbone]]''': a formation involving three running backs lined up behind the quarterback in the shape of a Y, similar to the shape of a [[wishbone]].

==X==
;X-receiver :Term used in play calling that usually refers to the '''split end''', or the [[wide receiver]] that lines up on the line of scrimmage.  For example, &quot;Split Right Jet 529 X Post&quot; tells the X-receiver to run a post route.

==Y==
;Y-receiver :Term usually used in offensive play calling to refer to the '''tight end'''.  For example, &quot;Buffalo Right 534 Boot Y Corner&quot; tells the Y-receiver to run a corner route.

==Z==
;Z-receiver :a term used in offensive play calling that usually refers to the '''flanker''', or the [[wide receiver]] that lines up off the line of scrimmage.  For example, &quot;Panther Gun 85 Slant Z Go&quot; tells the Z-receiver to run a '''go''' (also called a '''fly''' or '''streak''') route.

;zone defense :a defense in which players who are in pass coverage cover zones of the field, instead of individual players. Pure zone packages are seldom used; most defenses employ some combination of zone and man coverage. 
;[[zone blitz]] : A defensive package combining a blitz with zone pass coveragee.  Allows the defense to choose the blitzer after the offense shows formation and pass coverage requirements, and features unpredictable blitzes from different linebackers and defensive backs.  Invented by coach [[Dick LeBeau]].

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' is a procedure (a finite [[set]] of well-defined instructions) for accomplishing some task which, given an initial state, will [[termination|terminate]] in a defined end-state. 

Informally, the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a [[recipe]], although many algorithms are much more complex; algorithms often have steps that repeat ([[iteration|iterate]]) or require decisions (such as [[Boolean logic|logic]] or [[inequality|comparison]]). 

The concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording  procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or multiplying two numbers.  The concept was  formalized in [[1936]] through [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] and [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]], which in turn formed the foundation of [[computer science]].

Most algorithms can be implemented by [[computer program]]s.

== History ==
The word ''algorithm'' comes from the name of the 9th century mathematician [[al-Khwarizmi|Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi]].  The word ''[[algorism]]'' originally referred only to the rules of performing [[arithmetic]] using [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]] but evolved via European Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi's name into ''algorithm'' by the 18th century. The word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. 

The first case of an algorithm written for a [[computer]] was [[Ada Lovelace|Ada Byron]]'s [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|notes on the analytical engine]] written in 1842, for which she is considered by many to be the world's first [[programmer]].  However, since [[Charles Babbage]] never completed his [[analytical engine]] the algorithm was never implemented on it.

The lack of [[mathematical rigor]] in the &quot;well-defined procedure&quot; definition of algorithms posed some difficulties for mathematicians and [[logic]]ians of the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]].  This problem was largely solved with the description of the [[Turing machine]], an abstract model of a [[computer]] formulated by [[Alan Turing]], and the demonstration that every method yet found for describing &quot;well-defined procedures&quot; advanced by other mathematicians could be emulated on a Turing machine (a statement known as the [[Church-Turing thesis]]).  Nowadays, a formal criterion for an algorithm is that it is a procedure that can be implemented on a completely specified Turing machine or one of the equivalent [[formalism]]s. 
{{sect-stub}}

== Formalization of algorithms ==
Algorithms are essential to the way [[computer]]s process information, because a [[computer program]] is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to perform (in what specific order) in order to carry out a
specified task, such as calculating employees&amp;#8217; paychecks or printing students&amp;#8217; report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations which can be performed by a [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] system.

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data is read from an input source or device, written to an output sink or device, and/or stored for further use.  Stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. The state is stored in a [[data structure]].

For any such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation will almost always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting 'from the top' and going 'down to the bottom', an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, 'mechanical' means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of '[[memory]]' as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment. 

See [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]] for alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm.

Some writers restrict the definition of ''algorithm'' to procedures that eventually finish.  Others include procedures that could run forever without stopping, arguing that some entity may be required to carry out such permanent tasks.  In the latter case, success can no longer be defined in terms of halting with a meaningful output.  Instead, terms of success that allow for unbounded output sequences must be defined.  For example, an algorithm that verifies if there are more zeros than ones in an infinite random binary sequence must run forever to be effective.  If it is implemented correctly, however, the algorithm's output will be useful: for as long as it examines the sequence, the algorithm will give a positive response while the number of examined zeros outnumber the ones, and a negative response otherwise.  Success for this algorithm could then be defined as eventually outputting only positive responses if there are actually more zeros than ones in the sequence, and in any other case outputting any mixture of positive and negative responses.

Summarizing the above discussion about what algorithm should consist.

* Zero or more Inputs
* One or more Outputs
* Finiteness or computability 
* Definitiveness or Preciseness

=== Implementation ===
An algorithm is a set of steps to perform a computation. Most algorithms will be implemented as [[computer programs]]. They can be expressed in any notation including [[English language|English]] for documenting and research purposes. A more preferred way is to embody (or sometimes called ''codify'') an algorithm by writing of its [[pseudocode]].   [[Pseudocode]] representation avoids ambiguities that are common in English statements. The pseudocode can also be translated into particular programming language more straightforwardly. Algorithms are implemented not only as [[computer program]]s, but often also by other means, such as in a biological [[neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect relocating food), in [[electric circuit]]s, or in a mechanical device.

== Example ==
One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an (unsorted) list of numbers. The solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list, but only once at each. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in [[English language|English]] as

# Let us assume the first item is largest.
# Look at each of the remaining items in the list and make the following adjustment.
#:a. If it is larger than the largest item we gathered so far, make a note of it.
# The latest noted item is the largest in the list when the process is complete.

And here is a more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A non-empty list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The ''largest'' number in the list ''L''.
 
   ''largest'' &amp;larr; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' the list ''L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ge;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', '''do'''
     '''if''' the ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' &amp;larr; the ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''
{{algorithm-end}}

For a more complex example, see [[Euclid's algorithm]], which is one of the oldest algorithms.

=== Algorithm analysis ===

As it happens, most people who implement algorithms want to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers; for example, the algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore  it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)''{{ref|space}}.  (Note that the size of the inputs is not counted as space used by the algorithm.)

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or effort than others.  For example, given two different recipes for making potato salad, one may have ''peel the potato'' before ''boil the potato'' while the other presents the steps in the reverse order, yet they both call for these steps to be repeated for all potatoes and end when the potato salad is ready to be eaten.  &lt;!-- poor example .. who would boil each potato separately? and making a salad in general requires no cooking ... --&gt;

The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis and study of algorithms]] is one discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly (without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or other implementation).  In this sense, it resembles other mathematical disciplines in that the analysis focuses on the underlying principles of the algorithm, and not on any particular implementation. The pseudocode is simplest and abstract enough for such analysis.

== Classes ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== Classification by implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means. 

* '''Recursion''' or '''iteration''': A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]].  Iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation to other. For example, [[towers of hanoi]] is well understood in recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.

* '''Serial''' or '''parallel''': Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers.  An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s, which take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time. Parallel algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and pass them to many processors and put the results back together at one end. The resource consumption in parallel algorithms is both processor cycles on each processors and also the communication overhead between the processors. Sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Recursive algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems. Those problems cannot be solved faster by employing more processors. Iterative [[numerical methods]], such as [[Newton's method]] or the [[three body problem]], are algorithms which are inherently serial.

* '''Deterministic''' or '''random''': Deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm. Random algorithms as their name suggests explore the search space randomly until an acceptable solution is found. Various heuristic algorithms (see below) generally fall into the random category.

* '''Exact''' or '''approximate''': While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation which is close to the true solution.  Approximation may use either a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems.

=== Classification by design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories will include many different types of algorithms. Some commonly found paradigms include:

* '''Divide and conquer'''. A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]), until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is merge sorting. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in conquer phase by merging them. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called '''decrease and conquer algorithm''', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so conquer stage will be more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is [[binary search algorithm]].
* '''[[Dynamic programming]]'''. When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]], meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems, and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, we can often solve the problem quickly using ''dynamic programming'', an approach that avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is, subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, where as the overlap of subproblems occur in dynamic programming. The difference between the dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. Where subproblems are independent, there is no chance of repetition and memoization does not help, so dynamic programming is not a solution for all. By using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
* '''The greedy method'''. A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a [[dynamic programming|dynamic programming algorithm]], but the difference is that solutions to the subproblems do not have to be known at each stage; instead a &quot;greedy&quot; choice can be made of what looks best for the moment. Difference between dynamic programming and greedy method is, it extends the solution with the best possible decision (not all feasible decisions) at a algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision (not all possible decisions) made in previous stage. It is not exhaustive, and does not give accurate answer to many problems. But when it works, it will be the fastest method. The most popular greedy algorithm is finding the minimal spanning tree as given by [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]].
* '''Linear programming'''. When solving a problem using [[linear programming]], the program is put into a number of linear [[inequality|inequalities]] and then an attempt is made to maximize (or minimize) the inputs. Many problems (such as the [[Maximum flow problem|maximum flow]] for directed [[graph (mathematics)|graphs]]) can be stated in a linear programming way, and then be solved by a 'generic' algorithm such as the [[simplex algorithm]]. A complex variant of linear programming is called integer programming, where the solution space is restricted to all integers.
* '''[[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction]]''': It is another powerful technique in solving many problems by transforming one problem into another problem. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list is first translating this problem into sorting problem and finding the middle element in sorted list. The goal of reduction algorithms is finding the simplest transformation such that complexity of reduction algorithm does not dominate the complexity of reduced algorithm. This technique is also called ''transform and conquer''.
* '''Search and enumeration'''. Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes the [[search algorithm]]s and [[backtracking]].
* '''The probabilistic and heuristic paradigm'''. Algorithms belonging to this class fit the definition of an algorithm more loosely. 
# [[Probabilistic algorithm]]s are those that make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly); for some problems, it can in fact be proven that the fastest solutions must involve some [[randomness]]. 
# [[Genetic algorithm]]s attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological [[evolution]]ary processes, with a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of &quot;solutions&quot;. Thus, they emulate reproduction and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. In [[genetic programming]], this approach is extended to algorithms, by regarding the algorithm itself as a &quot;solution&quot; to a problem. Also there are 
# [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic]] algorithms, whose general purpose is not to find an optimal solution, but an approximate solution where the time or resources to find a perfect solution are not practical. An example of this would be [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[taboo search]], or [[simulated annealing]] algorithms, a class of heuristic probabilistic algorithms that vary the solution of a problem by a random amount. The name &quot;simulated annealing&quot; alludes to the metallurgic term meaning the heating and cooling of metal to achieve freedom from defects. The purpose of the random variance is to find close to globally optimal solutions rather than simply locally optimal ones, the idea being that the random element will be decreased as the algorithm settles down to a solution.

=== Classification by field of study ===
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are  [[search algorithm]]s, [[sort algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]]. 

''See also:'' '''[[List of algorithms]]''' for more details.

Some of these fields overlap with each other and advancing in algorithms for one field causes advancement in many fields and sometimes completely unrelated fields. For example, dynamic programming is originally invented for optimisation in resource consumption in industries, but it is used in solving broad range of problems in many fields.

=== Classification by complexity ===
Some algorithms complete in linear time, and some complete in exponential amount of time, and some never complete. One problem may have multiple algorithms, and some problems may have no algorithms. Some problems have no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. So computer scientists found it is suitable to classify the problems rather than algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity. 

''See also:'' '''[[Complexity class]]es''' for more details.

== Legal issues ==
Some countries allow algorithms to be [[patented]] when embodied in software or in hardware.  Patents have long been a controversial issue (see, for example, the [[software patent debate]]).

Some countries do not allow certain algorithms, such as cryptographic algorithms, to be [[exported]] from that country.

==Notes==
{{note|space}} Although in this example the size of the numbers itself is unbounded, one could therefore argue that the space requirement is O(log ''n''), in practice, however, the space taken up by a number is fixed.

Annuals are often used in [[garden]]s  to provide splashes of color, as they tend to produce more flowers than perennials. Some [[perennial plant|perennials]] and [[biennial plant|biennials]] are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered [[hardiness (plants)|hardy]] for the local climate. Also, many food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including most domesticated [[Cereal|grain]]s.

The life-cycle of an annual can occur in a period as short as two or three [[month]]s in some species, though most last a bit longer. Vegetables grown in apartment container gardens can last up to two years, if they are maintained indoors during the winter months.

Examples of annual plants include [[pea]]s, [[cauliflower]]s, [[basil]], and [[marigold]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Antiseptic]] mouth rinse, often called '''mouthwash''', is an [[oral hygiene]] product that claims to kill the [[germ]]s that cause [[Dental plaque|plaque]], [[gingivitis]], and [[bad breath]].  However, it is generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both [[toothbrush|brushing]] and [[flossing]].

Common use involves rinsing one's mouth with about 20 [[milliliter|ml]] (2/3 [[ounce|oz]]) of mouthwash two times a day after brushing.  The mouthwash is typically swished or [[gargling|gargled]] for about half a minute and then spit out. 

Active ingredients in commercial brands of mouthwash can include [[thymol]], [[eucalyptol]], [[methyl salicylate]], [[menthol]], [[chlorhexidine gluconate]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and sometimes [[enzymes]] and [[calcium]]. Ingredients also include [[water]], sweeteners such as [[sorbitol]] and [[Saccharine|Sodium saccharine]], and a significant amount of [[ethanol|alcohol]] (around 20%).  Because of the alcohol content, it is possible to fail a [[breathalyzer]] test after rinsing one's mouth. Many newer brands are alcohol-free.

A '''salt mouthwash''' is a homemade treatment for mouth infections and is made by dissolving a teaspoon of [[Edible salt|salt]] in a cup of warm water.

[[Image:AlexanderAttackingDarius.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Alexander the Great''' fighting Persian king [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] (not in frame) ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' from [[Pompeii]], from a [[3rd century BC]] original Greek painting, now lost).]]

'''Alexander [[List of people known as The Great|the Great]]''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] '''{{polytonic|ŒúŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ ŒëŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ}}''', transliterated ''Megas Alexandros'') (Alexander III of Macedon) was born in  [[Pella]], [[Macedon]], in [[July]], [[356 BC]], died in [[Babylon]], on  [[June 10]], [[323 BC]], King of Macedon [[336 BC|336]]&amp;ndash;[[323 BC]], is considered one of the most successful military commanders in world history (if not the greatest), conquering most of the [[Ptolemy_world_map|known world]] before his death. Alexander is also known in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Middle Persian]] work ''[[Book of Arda Viraf|Arda Wiraz NƒÅmag]]'' as &quot;the accursed Alexander&quot; due to his conquest of the [[Persian Empire]] and the destruction of its capital [[Persepolis]]. He is also known in Middle Eastern traditions as ''[[Dhul-Qarnayn]]'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and ''Dul-Qarnayim'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (the two-horned one), apparently due to an image on coins minted during his rule that seemingly depicted him with the two ram's horns of the Egyptian god [[Amun|Ammon]]. He is known as '''Sikandar''' in [[Hindi]]; in fact in [[India]], the term Sikandar is used as a synonym for &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;extremely skilled&quot;.

Following the unification of the multiple city-states of [[ancient Greece]] under the rule of his father, [[Philip II of Macedon]], (a labor Alexander had to repeat twice because the southern Greeks rebelled after Philip's death), Alexander conquered the [[Persian Empire]], including [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Gaza]], [[Egypt]], [[Bactria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] and extended the boundaries of his own [[empire]] as far as the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Alexander integrated foreigners (non-Macedonians, non-Greeks{{rf|1|MvsG1}}) into his army and administration, leading some scholars to credit him with a &quot;policy of fusion.&quot; He encouraged marriage between his army and foreigners, and practiced it himself. After twelve years of constant military campaigning, Alexander died, possibly of [[malaria]], [[typhoid]], viral [[encephalitis]] or even a drug overdose. His conquests ushered in centuries of Greek settlement and rule over foreign areas, a period known as the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]]. Alexander himself lived on in the history and myth of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. Already during his lifetime, and especially after his death, his exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appears as a towering legendary [[hero]] in the tradition of [[Achilles]].

==Early life==
	 
[[Image:AlexanderTheGreat Bust.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Alexander III in the [[British Museum]].]]	 
Alexander was the son of King Philip II of Macedon and of [[Epirus (region)|Epirote]] princess [[Olympias]].  According to [[Plutarch]] (''Alexander'' 3.1,3), Olympias was impregnated not by Philip, who was afraid of her and her affinity for sleeping in the company of snakes, but by [[Zeus]]. Plutarch (''Alexander'' 2.2-3) relates that both Philip and Olympias dreamt of their son's future birth. Olympias dreamed of a loud burst of thunder and of lightning striking her womb. In Philip's dream, he sealed her womb with the seal of the [[lion]]. Alarmed by this, he consulted the seer [[Aristander|Aristander of Telmessus]], who determined that his wife was pregnant and that the child would have the character of a lion.	

[[Aristotle]] was Alexander's tutor; he gave Alexander a thorough training in [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]] and stimulated his interest in [[science]], [[medicine]], and [[philosophy]]. After his visit to the [[Oracle]] of [[Amun|Ammon]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]], according to all five of the extant historians ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be [[Zeus]], rather than Philip. According to Plutarch (''Alexander'' 2.1), his father descended from [[Heracles]] through [[Caranus]] and his mother descended from [[Aeacus]] through [[Neoptolemus]] and [[Achilles]]. Aristotle gave him a copy of the [[Illiad]] and a knife that he always hid under his pillow at night.

===The ascent of Macedon===	 
When Philip led an attack on [[Byzantium]] in [[340 BC]], Alexander, aged 16, was left in command of Macedonia. In [[339 BC]], Philip took a second wife, to the chagrin of  Alexander's mother Olympias, which led to a quarrel between Alexander and his father and threw into question Alexander's succession to the Macedonian throne. In [[338 BC]], Philip created the [[League of Corinth]]. Alexander also assisted his father at the decisive battle of [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Chaeronea]] in this year. The [[Companion cavalry|cavalry]] wing led by Alexander annihilated the [[Sacred Band of Thebes]], an elite corps previously regarded as invincible. Philip was content to deprive Thebes of her dominion over [[Boeotia]] and leave a Macedonian garrison in the citadel.

In [[336 BC]], Philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to [[Alexander I of Epirus|King Alexander of Epirus]]. The [[assassin]] was supposedly a former lover of the king, the disgruntled young nobleman [[Pausanias (assassin)|Pausanias]], who held a grudge against Philip because the king had ignored a complaint he had expressed. Philip's murder was once thought to have been planned with the knowledge and involvement of Alexander or Olympias. Another possible instigator could have been [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]], the recently crowned King of Persia. [[Plutarch]] mentions an irate letter from Alexander to Darius, where Alexander blames Darius and [[Bagoas]], his [[grand vizier]], for his father's murder, stating that it was Darius who had been bragging with the Greek cities of how he managed to assassinate Philip.

After Philip's death, the army proclaimed Alexander, then aged 20, as the new king of Macedon. Greek cities like [[Athens]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], which had been forced to pledge allegiance to Philip, saw in the new king an opportunity to retake their full independence. Alexander moved swiftly and Thebes, which had been most active against him, submitted when he appeared at its gates. The assembled Greeks at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], with the sole exception of the [[Sparta]]ns, elected him to the command against Persia, which had previously been bestowed upon his father.

The next year, ([[335 BC]]), Alexander felt free to engage the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyria]]ns in order to secure the [[Danube]] as the northern boundary of the Macedonian kingdom. While he was triumphantly campaigning north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander reacted immediately and while the other cities once again hesitated, Thebes decided this time to resist with the utmost vigor. The resistance was useless; in the end, the city was conquered with great bloodshed. The Thebans encountered an ever harsher fate when their city was razed to the ground and its territory divided between the other Boeotian cities. Moreover, all of the city's citizens were sold into slavery, sparing only the priests, the leaders of the pro-Macedonian party and the descendants of [[Pindar]], whose house was the only one left untouched. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission and it readily accepted Alexander's demand for the exile of all the leaders of the anti-Macedonian party, [[Demosthenes]] first of all.

==Period of conquests==
[[Image:Map-alexander-empire.png|thumb|440px|Map of Alexander's empire.]]

===The fall of the Persian Empire===
Alexander's army had crossed the [[Hellespont]] with about 42,000 soldiers primarily Macedonians{{rf|2|MvsG2}} and Greeks, but also including some Thracians, [[Paionia]]ns and Illyrians. After an initial victory against Persian forces at the [[Battle of the Granicus|Battle of Granicus]], Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of [[Sardis]] and proceeded down the [[Ionia|Ionian]] coast. At [[Halicarnassus]], Alexander successfully waged the first of many [[siege]]s, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain [[Memnon of Rhodes]] and the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Caria]], [[Orontobates]], to withdraw by sea. Alexander left Caria in the hands of [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who was ruler of Caria before being deposed by her brother [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]]. From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous [[Lycia]] and the [[Pamphylia]]n plain, asserting control over all coastal cities and denying them to his enemy. From Pamphylia onward, the coast held no major ports and so Alexander moved inland. At [[Termessus]], Alexander humbled but did not storm the [[Pisidia]]n city. At the ancient Phrygian capital of [[Gordium]], Alexander &quot;undid&quot; the tangled [[Gordian Knot|Gordian knot]], a feat said to await the future &quot;king of [[Asia]].&quot; According to the most vivid story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone, and he hacked it apart with his sword. Another version claims that he did not use the sword, but actually figured out how to undo the knot.

[[Image:AlexMos.jpg|thumb|350px|Alexander battling Darius at the [[Battle of Issus]], Pompei mosaic.]]

Alexander's army crossed the [[Cilician Gates]], met and defeated the main Persian army under the command of Darius III at the [[Battle of Issus]] in [[333 BC]]. Darius fled this battle in such a panic for his life that he left behind his wife, his children, his mother, and much of his personal treasure. [[Sisygambis]], the queen mother, never forgave Darius for abandoning her. She disowned him and adopted Alexander as her son instead. Proceeding down the [[Mediterranean]] coast, he took [[Tyre]] and [[Gaza]] after famous sieges (see [[Siege of Tyre]]). Alexander passed near but probably did not visit [[Jerusalem]].

In [[332 BC]] - [[331 BC]], Alexander was welcomed as a liberator in [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Egypt]] and was pronounced the son of Zeus by Egyptian priests of the god Ammon at the Oracle of the god at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the [[Libya]]n desert. He founded [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the [[Ptolemaic]] dynasty after his death. Leaving Egypt, Alexander marched eastward into [[Assyria]] (now northern [[Iraq]]) and defeated Darius and a third Persian army at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Darius was forced to flee the field after his charioteer was killed, and Alexander chased him as far as [[Arbela]]. While Darius fled over the mountains to [[Ecbatana]] (modern [[Hamadan]]), Alexander marched to [[Babylon]]. 

[[Image:UrumqiSoldier.jpg|thumb|180px|Statuette of a Greek soldier, from a 4th - 3rd century BC burial site north of the [[Tian Shan]], at the maximum extent of Alexander's advance in the East ([[√úr√ºmqi]], [[Xinjiang]] Museum, [[China]]) (drawing).]]

From Babylon, Alexander went to [[Susa]], one of the [[Achaemenid]] capitals, and captured its treasury. Sending the bulk of his army to [[Persepolis]], the Persian capital, by the [[Royal Road]], Alexander stormed and captured the Persian Gates (in the modern [[Zagros Mountains]]), then sprinted for [[Persepolis]] before its treasury could be looted. Alexander allowed the League forces to loot Persepolis. A fire broke out in the eastern palace of [[Xerxes]] and spread to the rest of the city. It was not known if it was a drunken accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the [[Athenian Acropolis]] during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian War]]. The ''Book of Arda Wiraz'', a Zoroastrian work composed in the 3rd or 4th century AD, also speaks of archives containing &quot;all the [[Avesta]] and Zand, written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink&quot; that were destroyed; but it must be said that this statement is often treated by scholars with a certain measure of skepticism, because it is generally thought that for many centuries the Avesta was transmitted mainly orally by the [[Magians]].    

He then set off in pursuit of Darius, who was kidnapped, and then murdered by followers of [[Bessus]], his [[Bactria]]n satrap and kinsman. Bessus then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V and retreated into [[Central Asia]] to launch a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against Alexander. With the death of Darius, Alexander declared the war of vengeance over, and released his Greek and other allies from service in the League campaign (although he allowed those that wished to re-enlist as [[mercenaries]] in his imperial army). 

His three-year campaign against first Bessus and then the satrap of [[Sogdiana]], [[Spitamenes]], took him through [[Medes|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Aria (place)|Aria]], [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]], [[Bactria]], and [[Scythia]]. In the process, he captured and refounded [[Herat]] and [[Samarkand|Maracanda]]. Moreover, he founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in [[Afghanistan]], and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (&quot;The Furthest&quot;) in modern [[Tajikistan]]. In the end, both were betrayed by their men, Bessus in [[329 BC]] and Spitamenes the year after.

====Hostility toward Alexander====
During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', a symbolic kissing of the hand that Persians paid to their social superiors, but a practice of which the Greeks disapproved. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the preserve of [[deities]] and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him much in the sympathies of many of his countrymen. Here, too, a plot against his life was revealed, and his [[Companion cavalry|companion]] [[Philotas]] was executed for treason for failing to bring the plot to his attention. [[Parmenion]], Philotas' father, who was at the head of an army at [[Ecbatana]], was assassinated by command of Alexander, who feared that Parmenion might attempt to avenge his son. Several other trials for treason followed, and many Macedonians were executed. Later on, in a drunken quarrel at [[Maracanda]], he also killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Clitus the Black]]. Later in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life, this one by his own [[page (servant)|pages]], was revealed, and his official historian, [[Callisthenes]] of [[Olynthus]] (who had fallen out of favor with the king by leading the opposition to his attempt to introduce ''proskynesis''), was implicated on what many historians regard as trumped-up charges. However, the evidence is strong that Callisthenes, the teacher of the pages, must have been the one who persuaded them to assassinate the king.

===The invasion of India===

With the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to [[Roxana]] (Roshanak in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]) to cement his relations with his new Central Asian satrapies, in [[326 BC]] Alexander was finally free to turn his attention to [[India]]. King [[Taxiles|Ambhi]], ruler of [[Taxila]], surrendered the city to Alexander. Many people had fled to a high fortress called [[Aornos]]. Alexander took Aornos by storm. Alexander fought an epic battle against [[Porus]], a ruler of a region in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the [[Battle of Hydaspes]] in ([[326 BC]]). After attaining victory, Alexander made an alliance with Porus and appointed him as satrap of his own kingdom. Alexander then named one of the two new cities that he founded, Bucephala, in honor of his noble mount who had brought him to India. Alexander continued on to conquer all the headwaters of the [[Indus River]]. 

East of Porus' kingdom, near the [[Ganges River]], was the powerful empire of [[Magadha]] ruled by the [[Nanda dynasty]]. Fearing the prospects of facing another powerful Indian army and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the [[Beas River|Hyphasis]] (modern Beas), refusing to march further east. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, [[Coenus]], was convinced that it was better to return. Alexander was forced to turn south, conquering his way down the Indus to the Indian Ocean. He sent much of his army to [[Carmania]] (modern southern [[Iran]]) with his general [[Craterus]], and commissioned a fleet to explore the [[Persian Gulf]] shore under his admiral [[Nearchus]], while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through the [[Gedrosia]] (present day [[Makran]] in southern [[Pakistan]]).

===After India===
[[Image:Le Brun, Alexander and Porus.jpg|thumb|350px|''Alexander and [[Porus]]'' by [[Charles Le Brun]], [[1673]].]]

Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed a number of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send those over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedonia under Craterus, but his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of [[Opis]], refusing to be sent away and bitterly criticizing his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units. Alexander executed the ringleaders of the mutiny, but forgave the rank and file. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, he held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Opis, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.

His attempts to merge Persian culture with his Greek soldiers also included training a regiment of Persian boys in the ways of Macedonians. It is not certain that Alexander adopted the Persian royal title of ''[[shah|shahanshah]]'' (&quot;great king&quot; or 
&quot;king of kings&quot;). However, most historians believe that he did.

Alexander let it be known that he intended to launch a campaign against the tribes of Arabia. After they were subjugated, it was assumed that Alexander would turn westwards and attack [[Carthage]] and [[Italy]].

After traveling to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure, his closest friend and possible lover [[Hephaestion]] died of an illness. Alexander was distraught and on his return to Babylon, he fell ill and died.

==Alexander's marriages and sexuality==
Alexander's greatest emotional attachment is generally considered to have been to his companion, cavalry commander (''chiliarchos'') and probable lover, [[Hephaestion]]. They had most likely been best friends since childhood for Hephaestion too received his education at the court of Alexander's father. Hephaestion makes his appearance in history at the point when Alexander reaches [[Troy]]. There the two friends made sacrifices at the shrines of the two heroes [[Achilles]] and [[Patroclus]]; Alexander honoring Achilles, and Hephaestion honoring Patroclus. As [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] in his ''Varia Historia'' (12.7) claims, &quot;He thus intimated that he was the object of Alexander's love, as Patroclus was of Achilles.&quot;  Following Hephaestion's death, Alexander mourned him greatly, and did not eat for days.

Many have discussed Alexander's ambiguous sexuality. [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]] reports that, &quot;He scorned [feminine] sensual pleasures to such an extent that his mother was anxious lest he be unable to beget offspring.&quot; To encourage a relationship with a woman, King Philip and Olympias brought in a high-priced [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[hetaira|courtesan]] named Callixena.

Later in life, Alexander married several princesses of former Persian territories, [[Roxana]] of [[Bactria]], [[Statira]], daughter of Darius III, and [[Parysatis]], daughter of [[Ochus]]. He fathered two children, ([[Heracles (Macedon)|Heracles]]), born by his concubine [[Barsine]] (the daughter of satrap [[Artabazus of Phrygia]]) in [[327 BC]], and [[Alexander IV of Macedon]], born by Roxana shortly after his death in [[323 BC]].

Curtius maintains that Alexander also took as a lover &quot;[[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]], a [[eunuch]] exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate,&quot; (VI.5.23). Bagoas is the only one who is actually named as the ''eromenos'' &amp;mdash; the beloved &amp;mdash; of Alexander. Their relationship seems to have been well known among the troops, as [[Plutarch]] recounts an episode (also mentioned by [[Dicaearchus]]) during some festivities on the way back from India) in which his men clamor for him to openly kiss the young man: &quot;Bagoas [...] sat down close by him, which so pleased the Macedonians, that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss Bagoas, and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him.&quot; At this point in time, the troops present were all survivors of the crossing of the desert. Bagoas must have endeared himself to them by his courage and fortitude during that harrowing episode.  Whatever Alexander's relationship with Bagoas, it was no impediment to relations with his queen: six months after Alexander's death Roxana gave birth to his son and heir, Alexander IV. Besides Bagoas, Curtius mentions yet another possible lover of Alexander, Euxenippus, &quot;whose youthful grace filled him with enthusiasm&quot; (VII.9.19).

Allegations concerning Alexander's sexuality remain highly controversial and excite passions in some quarters. People of various national, ethnic and cultural origins regard him as their hero. Some argue that historical accounts describing Alexander's love for Hephaestion and Bagoas as sexual were written centuries after the fact, and thus it can never be established what the historical relationship between Alexander and his male companions were. Others argue that the same can be said about much of our information regarding Alexander. Such debates, however, are generally considered anachronistic by scholars of the period, who point out that the concept of homosexuality as understood today did not exist in [[Greco-Roman]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]].  Sexual attraction between males was seen as a normal and universal part of [[human nature]] since it was believed that men were attracted to [[beauty]], an attribute of the young, regardless of gender. If Alexander's love life was transgressive, it was not for his love of beautiful youths but for his probable involvement with a man his own age, in a time when the standard model of male love was [[pederasty|pederastic]]. See [[Pederasty in ancient Greece]] for more information.

==The army of Alexander the Great before the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]==
{{main|Ancient Macedonian military}}
The army of Alexander was, for the most part, that of his father Philip. It was composed of light and heavy troops and some engineers, medical and staff units. About one third of the army was composed of his Greek allies from the Hellenic League. 

===Infantry===
[[Image:Macedonian battle formation.gif|right|thumb|330px|Macedonian battle formation, courtesy of The Department of History, United States Military Academy.]]
The main infantry corps was the [[Macedonian phalanx|phalanx]], composed of six regiments (''taxies'') numbering about 2000 phalangites each. Each soldier had a long [[pike]] called a ''[[sarissa]]'', which was up to 21 feet long, and a short [[sword]]. For protection, the soldier wore a [[Phrygian cap|Phrygian-style]] [[helmet]] and a [[shield]]. [[Arrian]] mentions large shields (the ''[[aspis]]''), but this is disputed, as it is difficult to wield both a large pike and a large shield at the same time. Many modern historians claim the [[phalanx]] used a smaller shield, called a ''[[pelta]]'', the shield used by [[peltast]]s. It is unclear whether the phalanx used body armor, but heavy body armor is mentioned in Arrian (1.28.7) and other ancient sources. Modern historians believe most of the phalangites did not wear heavy body armor at the time of Alexander.

Another important unit were the [[hypaspist]]s (shield bearers), arranged into three battalions (''[[lochoi]]'') of 1000 men each. One of the battalions was named the ''[[Agema]]'' and served as the King's bodyguards. Their armament is unknown and it is difficult to get a clear picture from ancient sources. Sometimes hypaspists are mentioned in the front line of the battle just between the phalanx and the heavy [[cavalry]]. Moreover, they seem to have acted as an extension of the phalanx fighting as heavy infantry while keeping a link between the heavily clad phalangites and the companion cavalry. They also accompanied Alexander on flanking marches and were capable of fighting on rough terrain like light troops so it seems they could perform dual functions.

In addition to the units mentioned above, the army included some 6000 Greek allied and mercenary [[hoplite]]s, also arranged in phalanxes. They carried a shorter [[spear]], a ''[[dora]]'', which was six or seven feet long and a large ''aspis''. 

Alexander also had light infantry units composed of [[peltast]]s, [[psiloi]] and others. Peltasts are considered to be light infantry, although they had a helmet and a small shield and were heavier than the ''psiloi''. The best peltasts were the [[Agrianians]] from [[Thrace]].

===Cavalry===
The heavy cavalry included the [[Companion cavalry]] raised from the Macedonian nobility, and the Thessalian cavalry. The Companion cavalry (''hetairoi'', friends) was divided into eight squadrons called ''ile'', 200 strong, except the Royal Squadron of 300. They were equipped with a 12 foot lance, the ''xyston'', and heavy body armor. The horses were partially clad in armor as well. The riders did not carry shields, as the xyston required both hands to wield. The organization of the Thessalian cavalry was similar to the Companion Cavalry, but they had a shorter spear and fought in a looser formation.

Of light cavalry, the ''prodromoi'' (forerunners) secured the wings of the army during battle and went on [[reconnaissance]] missions. Several hundred allied horses rounded out the cavalry.

==Death==
[[Image:Alexander the great 1.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Alexander the Great.]]

On the afternoon of [[June 10]] - [[June 11|11]], [[323 BC]], Alexander died of a mysterious illness in the palace of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadrezzar II of Babylon]]. He was just one month shy of attaining 33 years of age. Various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include [[poisoning]] by the sons of [[Antipater]] or others, sickness that followed a drinking party, or a relapse of the [[malaria]] he had contracted in [[336 BC]].

What is certain is that on May 29, Alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend [[Medius of Larissa]]. After some heavy drinking, immediately or after a bath, he was forced to bed badly ill. The troops started rumors, more and more anxious, and on June 9, the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time. They were admitted to his presence one at a time, while the king, too ill to speak, confined himself to move his hand. The day after, Alexander was dead.  

The poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by Justin and Curtius. The original story stated that [[Cassander]], son of [[Antipater]], viceroy of Greece, brought the poison to Alexander in Babylon in a mule's hoof, and that Alexander's royal cupbearer, [[Iollas]], brother of Cassander, administered it. Many had powerful motivations for seeing Alexander gone, and were none the worse for it after his death. Deadly agents that could have killed Alexander in one or more doses include hellebore and [[strychnine]].  In [[Robin Lane Fox|R. Lane Fox]]'s opinion, the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world, such long-acting poisons were probably not available (though this discounts the possibility of multiple doses). 

However, the warrior culture of Macedon favored the sword over strychnine, and many ancient historians, like [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]], maintained that Alexander was not poisoned, but died of natural causes.  Instead, it is likely that Alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever, which were rampant in ancient Babylon.  Other illnesses could have also been the culprit, including [[acute pancreatitis]] or the [[West Nile virus|West Nile]] virus. Recently, theories have been advanced stating that Alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease.  [[Hellebore]], believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses, may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery, with deadly results.  Disease-related theories often cite the fact that Alexander's health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds (including one in [[India]] that nearly claimed his life), and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness or another finally killed him.  

No story is conclusive. Alexander's death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries, and each generation offers a new take on it. What is certain is that Alexander died of a high fever on June 10 or 11 of 323 BC. On his death bed, his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom. Since Alexander had only one heir, it was a question of vital importance. He answered famously, &quot;the strongest.&quot;  Before dying, his final words were &quot;I foresee a great funeral contest over me.&quot; Alexander's 'funeral games', where his marshals fought it out over control of his empire, lasted for nearly forty years.  

Alexander's death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life. Before long, accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another, making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half-truths from the actual events. No contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level of self-serving recording, and as a result what truly happened to Alexander the Great may never be known.

Alexander's body was placed in a gold anthropid [[sarcophagus]], which was in turn placed in a second gold casket and covered with a purple robe. Alexander's coffin was placed, together with his armor, in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an Ionic peristyle. The decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by Diodoros. 

According to legend, Alexander was preserved in a clay vessel full of [[honey]] (which acts as a preservative) and interred in a glass [[coffin]]. According to Aelian (''Varia Historia'' 12.64), [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] stole the body and brought it to [[Alexandria]], where it was on display until Late Antiquity. It was here that [[Ptolemy IX of Egypt|Ptolemy IX]], one of the last successors of Ptolemy I, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one, and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage. The citizens of Alexandria were outraged at this and soon after Ptolemy IX was killed. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

The so-called &quot;Alexander Sarcophagus,&quot; discovered near [[Sidon]] and now in the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]], is now generally thought to be that of [[Abdylonymus]], whom Hephaestion appointed as the king of Sidon by Alexander's order. The sarcophagus depicts Alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the Persians.

==Legacy and division of the empire==
{{main|Diadochi}}
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Alexander bearing an [[Aramaic language]] inscription.]]
After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his officers, mostly with the pretense of first preserving a united kingdom. Later, his officers were focused on the explicit formation of rival monarchies and territorial states. 

Ultimately, the conflict was settled after the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]] in [[301 BC]]. Alexander's empire was divided at first into four major portions: Cassander ruled in [[Macedon]], [[Lysimachus]] in [[Thrace]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Iran]], and [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] ruled for a while in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] but was eventually defeated by the other generals at Ipsus ([[301 BC]]). Control over [[India]]n territory was short-lived when Seleucus was defeated by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the first [[Mauryan]] emperor.

By [[270 BC]], [[Hellenistic]] states consolidated, with:
:*The [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid Empire]] centered on Macedon.
:*The [[Seleucid Empire]] in Asia
:*The [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic kingdom]] in Egypt, Palestine and [[Cyrenaica]] 

By the [[1st century BC]] though, most of the Hellenistic territories in the West had been absorbed by the [[Roman Republic]]. In the East, they had been dramatically reduced by the expansion of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the secession of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom.

Alexander's conquests also had long term [[cultural]] effects, with the flourishing of [[Hellenistic civilization]] throughout the [[Middle-East]] and [[Central Asia]], and the development of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].
===Influence on [[Ancient Rome]]===
[[Image:Mosaica.jpg|thumb|200px|A mural in [[Pompeii]], depicting the marriage of Alexander to Barsine (Stateira) in 324 BC. The couple are apparently dressed as Ares and Aphrodite.]]
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements, although very little is known about Roman-Macedonian diplomatic relations of that time. [[Julius Caesar]] wept in Spain at the mere sight of Alexander's statue and [[Pompey the Great]] rummaged through the closets of conquered nations for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which the Roman general then wore as the costume of greatness. However in his zeal to honor Alexander, [[Octavian Augustus]] accidentally broke the nose off the Macedonian's mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the hero's shrine in Alexandria, Egypt. The unbalanced emperor [[Caligula]] later took the dead king's armor from that tomb and donned it
for luck. The Macriani, a Roman family that rose to the imperial throne in the [[3rd century]] A.D., always kept images of Alexander on their persons, either stamped into their bracelets and rings or stitched into their garments. Even their dinnerware bore Alexander's face, with the story of the king's life displayed around the rims of special bowls[[#Notes|&amp;sup1;]].

In the summer of [[1995]] during the archaeological work of the season centered on excavating the remains of domestic architecture of early-Roman date a statue of Alexander was recovered from the structure, which was richly decorated with mosaic and marble pavements and probably was constructed in the 1st century A.D. and occupied until the 3rd century[[#Notes|&amp;sup2;]].

==Alexander's character==
{{npov-section}}

[[Image:Ac alexanderstatue.jpg|thumb|250px|Equestrian statue of [[Alexander the Great]], on the waterfront at [[Thessaloniki]], capital of [[Greek Macedonia]].]]

Modern opinion on Alexander has run the gamut from the idea that he believed he was on a divinely-inspired mission to unite the [[human race]], to the view that he was a [[Narcissism|megalomaniac]] bent on [[Global domination|world domination]]. Such views tend to be [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], however, and the sources allow for a variety of interpretations. Much about Alexander's personality and aims remains enigmatic.

Alexander is remembered as a legendary hero in [[Europe]] and much of both [[Southwest Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], where he is known as '''Iskander''' or '''Iskandar Zulkarnain'''. To [[Zoroastrians]], on the other hand, he is remembered as the destroyer of their first great empire and as the leveller of [[Persepolis]]. Ancient sources are generally written with an agenda of either glorifying or denigrating the man, making it difficult to evaluate his actual character. Most refer to a growing instability and megalomania in the years following Gaugamela, but it has been suggested that this simply reflects the Greek [[stereotype]] of an orientalizing king. The murder of his friend [[Clitus the Black|Clitus]], which Alexander deeply and immediately regretted, is often cited as a sign of his paranoia, as is his execution of Philotas and his general Parmenion for failure to pass along details of a plot against him. However, this may have been more prudence than paranoia.

Modern Alexandrists continue to debate these same issues, among others, in modern times. One unresolved topic involves whether Alexander was actually attempting to better the world by his conquests, or whether his purpose was primarily to rule the world.

Partially in response to the ubiquity of positive portrayals of Alexander, an alternate character is sometimes presented which emphasizes some of Alexander's negative aspects. Some proponents of this view cite the destructions of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tyre]], [[Persepolis]], and [[Gaza]] as examples of atrocities, and argue that Alexander preferred to fight rather than negotiate. It is further claimed, in response to the view that Alexander was generally tolerant of the cultures of those whom he conquered, that his attempts at cultural fusion were severely practical and that he never actually admired Persian art or culture. To this way of thinking, Alexander was, first and foremost, a general rather than a statesman.

Alexander's character also suffers from the interpretation of historians who themselves are subject to the bias and idealisms of their own time. Good examples are [[W. W. Tarn]], who wrote during the late [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]], and who saw Alexander in an extremely good light, and [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], who wrote after [[World War II]] and for whom Alexander did little that was not inherently selfish or ambition-driven. Tarn wrote in an age where world conquest and warrior-heroes were acceptable, even encouraged, whereas Green wrote with the backdrop of [[the Holocaust]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s. As a result, Alexander's character is skewed depending on which way the historian's own culture is, and further muddles the debate of who he truly was.

===Stories and legends===
According to one story, the philosopher [[Anaxarchus]] checked the vainglory of Alexander, when he aspired to the honors of divinity, by pointing to Alexander's wound, saying, &quot;See the blood of a mortal, not the [[ichor]] of a god.&quot; In another version, Alexander himself pointed out the difference in response to a [[sycophant]]ic soldier. A strong oral tradition, although not attested in any extant primary source, lists Alexander as having [[epilepsy]], known to the Greeks as the Sacred Disease and thought to be a mark of divine favor.

Alexander had a legendary horse named [[Bucephalus]] (meaning &quot;ox-headed&quot;), supposedly descended from the [[Mares of Diomedes]]. Alexander himself, while still a young boy, tamed this horse after experienced horse-trainers failed to do so.

There is an apocryphal tale, appearing in a redaction of the pseudo-historical [[Alexander Romance]], which details another end for the last true Pharaoh of Egypt. Soon after Alexander's divinity was confirmed by the Oracle of Zeus Ammon, a rumor was begun that [[Nectanebo II]] did not travel to [[Nubia]] but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. He coupled with Phillip's wife [[Olympias]] and from his issue came Alexander. This myth would hold strong appeal for Egyptians who desired continuity in rule and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule.

Another legend tells of Alexander's campaign down into the Syrian world toward Egypt. On the way, he planned to lay siege to the city of [[Jerusalem]]. As the victorious armies of the Greeks approached the city, word was brought to the Jews in Jerusalem that the armies were on their way. The high priest at that time, who was a godly old man by the name of Jaddua (mentioned also in the [[Bible]] [[book of Nehemiah]]) took the sacred writings of [[Daniel the prophet]] and, accompanied by a host of other priests dressed in white garments, went forth and met Alexander some distance outside the city.

All this is from the report of [[Josephus]], the Jewish historian, who tells us that Alexander left his army and hurried to meet this body of priests. When he met them, he told the high priest that he had had a vision the night before in which God had shown him an old man, robed in a white garment, who would show him something of great significance to himself, according to the account, the high priest then opened the prophecies of Daniel and read them to Alexander.

In the prophecies Alexander was able to see the predictions that he would become that notable goat with the horn in his forehead, who would come from the West and smash the power of Persia and conquer the world. He was so overwhelmed by the accuracy of this prophecy and, of course, by the fact that it spoke about him, that he promised that he would save Jerusalem from siege, and sent the high priest back with honors.

==Ancient sources==
The ancient sources for Alexander's life are, from the perspective of ancient history, relatively numerous. Alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter-fragments of dubious authenticity, but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full accounts. The key contemporary historians are considered [[Callisthenes]], his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Nearchus]] and [[Onesicritus]]. Another influential account was penned by [[Cleitarchus]], who, while not a direct witness of Alexander's expedition, used the sources which had just been published. His work was to be the backbone of that of [[Timagenes]], who heavily influenced many surviving historians. Unfortunately, all these works were lost. Instead, the modern historian must rely on authors who used these and other early sources. 

The five main accounts are by Arrian, Curtius, Plutarch, Diodorus, and Justin.
* ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' (''The Campaigns of Alexander'' in Greek) by the Greek historian [[Arrian]] of [[Nicomedia]], writing in the [[2nd century AD]], and based largely on Ptolemy and, to a lesser extent, Aristobulus and Nearchus. It is considered generally the most trustworthy source.
* ''Historiae Alexandri Magni'', a biography of Alexander in ten books, of which the last eight survive, by the Roman historian [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], written in the [[1st century AD]], and based largely on Cleitarchus through the mediation of Timagenes, with some material probably from Ptolemy;
* ''Life of Alexander'' (see ''[[Parallel Lives]]'') and two orations ''On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great'' (see ''[[Moralia]]''), by the Greek historian and biographer [[Plutarch]] of [[Chaeronea]] in the second century, based largely on Aristobulus and especially Cleitarchus.
* ''Bibliotheca historia'' (''Library of world history''), written in Greek by the [[Sicilian]] historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], from which Book 17 relates the conquests of Alexander, based almost entirely on Timagenes's work. The books immediately before and after, on Philip and Alexander's &quot;Successors,&quot; throw light on Alexander's reign.
* The ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' by [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], which contains factual errors and is highly compressed. It is difficult in this case to understand the source, since we only have an epitome, but it is thought that also [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]] may have limited himself to use Timagenes for his Latin history. To these five main sources some like to add the ''[[Metz Epitome]]'', an anonymous late Latin work that narrates Alexander's campaigns from [[Hyrcania]] to India. Much is also recounted incidentally in other authors, including [[Strabo]], [[Athenaeus]], [[Polyaenus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and others.

The &quot;problem of the sources&quot; is the main concern (and chief delight) of Alexander-historians. In effect, each presents a different &quot;Alexander,&quot; with details to suit. Arrian is mostly interested in the military aspects, while Curtius veers to a more private and darker Alexander. Plutarch can't resist a good story, light or dark. All, with the possible exception of Arrian, include a considerable level of fantasy, prompting Strabo to remark, &quot;All who wrote about Alexander preferred the marvellous to the true.&quot; Nevertheless, the sources tell us much, and leave much to our interpretation and imagination.

==Alexander's legend==
Alexander was a legend in his own time. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in [[Cilicia]] as drawing back from him in [[proskynesis]]. Writing after Alexander's death, another participant, [[Onesicritus]], went so far as to invent a [[tryst]] between Alexander and [[Thalestris]], queen of the mythical [[Amazons]]. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King [[Lysimachus]], Lysimachus reportedly quipped &quot;I wonder where I was at the time.&quot; 

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in [[Alexandria]], a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', later falsely ascribed to the historian Callisthenes and therefore known as ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]], exhibiting a plasticity unseen in &quot;higher&quot; literary forms. Latin and [[Syriac]] translations were made in Late Antiquity. From these, versions were developed in all the major languages of [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[French language|French]]. The &quot;Romance&quot; is regarded by most Western scholars as the source of the [[account of Alexander given in the Qur'an]] ([[Sura]] ''The Cave''). It is the source of many incidents in [[Ferdowsi]]'s &quot;[[Shahnama]]&quot;. A [[Mongol]]ian version is also extant. 

Some believe that, excepting certain religious texts, it is the most widely-read work of pre-modern times.

===Alexander's legend in non-Western sources===
{{main|Alexander in the Qur'an (Theory)}}
Alexander was often identified in Persian and Arabic-language sources as [[Dhul-Qarnayn]], Arabic for the &quot;Two-Horned One&quot;, possibly a reference to the appearance of a horn-headed figure that appears on coins minted during his rule and later imitated in ancient Middle Eastern coinage. If this theory is followed, [[Islamic]] accounts of the Alexander legend, particularly in the [[Qur'an]] and in Persian legends, combined the [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]] legendary, pseudo-religious material about Alexander. The same legends from the Pseudo-Callisthenes were combined in Persia with [[Sasanid]] [[Pahlavi languge|Persian]] ideas about Alexander in the [[Iskandarnamah]].

==Main towns founded by Alexander==
Around seventy towns or outposts are claimed to have been founded by Alexander. Some of the main ones are: 

* [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]
* [[Alexandria Asiana]], [[Iran]]
* [[Alexandria in Ariana]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria on the Oxus]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria of the Arachosians]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria on the Indus]] (Alexandria Bucephalous), [[Pakistan]]
* [[Alexandria Eschate|Alexandria Eschate, &quot;The furthest&quot;]], [[Tajikistan]]
* [[Iskenderun]] (Alexandretta), [[Turkey]]
* [[Kandahar]] (Alexandropolis), [[Afghanistan]]

==Notes==
{{ent|1|MvsG1}} Whether the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] of Alexander's time and before were [[Hellenes]] (Greeks) is disputed by scholars. The question largely depends on the classification of the [[Ancient Macedonian language]]. By separating Macedonians and Greeks in this sentence and others, no position in this debate is implied.

'''Alfred Korzybski''' was born on [[July 3]], [[1879]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], and died on [[March 1]], [[1950]] in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]], [[United States|USA]]. He is probably best-remembered for developing the theory of [[general semantics]].

==Early life and career==
He came from an [[aristocratic]] family whose members had worked as [[Mathematics|mathematicians]], [[Science|scientists]], and [[Engineering|engineers]] for generations, and he chose to train as an engineer.

Korzybski was educated at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] Korzybski served as an [[Military intelligence|intelligence officer]] in the [[Russia|Russian]] Army. After being wounded in his leg and suffering other injuries, he came to North America in [[1916]] (first to [[Canada]], then the [[United States]]) to coordinate the shipment of artillery to the war front. He also lectured to [[Polish-American]] audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of war bonds. Following the war, he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] in [[1940]]. His first book, &lt;cite&gt;Manhood of Humanity&lt;/cite&gt; was published in [[1921]]. In the book, he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a [[time-binding]] class of life.

==General semantics ==
Korzybski's work culminated in the founding of a discipline that he called [[general semantics]] (GS). As Korzybski explicitly said, GS should not be confused with [[semantics]], a different subject. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are outlined in &lt;cite&gt;Science and Sanity&lt;/cite&gt;, published in [[1933]]. In [[1938]] Korzybski founded the [[Institute of General Semantics]] and directed it until his death.

In simplified form, the &quot;essence&quot; of Korzybski's work was the claim that human beings are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the [[structure]] of their languages. Human beings cannot experience the world directly, but only through their &quot;abstractions&quot; (nonverbal impressions or &quot;gleanings&quot; derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). Sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the &quot;facts&quot; with which we must deal. Our understanding of what is going on sometimes lacks ''similarity of structure'' with what is actually going on. He stressed training in awareness of abstracting, using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, &quot;consciousness of abstracting.&quot; His system included modifying the way we approach the world, e.g., with an attitude of &quot;I don't know; let's see,&quot; to better discover or reflect its realities as shown by modern science. One of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience that he called, &quot;silence on the objective levels.&quot;

== Korzybski and ''to be'' ==
It is often said that Korzybski opposed the use of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; an unfortunate exaggeration. He thought that ''certain uses'' of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; called the &quot;is of identity&quot; and the &quot;is of predication,&quot; were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as &quot;Joe is a fool&quot; (said of a person named 'Joe' who has done something that we regard as dumb). Korzybski's remedy was to ''deny'' identity; in this example, to be continually aware that 'Joe' is ''not'' what we ''call'' him. We find Joe not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain. This was expressed in Korzybski's most famous premise, &quot;[[The map is not the territory|the map is not the territory]].&quot; Note that &quot;the map is not the territory,&quot; uses the phrase &quot;is not&quot;, a form of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; This example shows that he did not intend to abandon the verb as such.

== Anecdote about Korzybski ==
One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he suddenly interrupted the lesson in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row, if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. &quot;Nice biscuit, don't you think&quot;, said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words &quot;Dog Cookies&quot;. The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to throw up, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. &quot;You see, ladies and gentlemen&quot;, Korzybski remarked, &quot;I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.&quot; Apparently his prank aimed to illustrate how human suffering originates from the confusion or conflation of linguistic representations of reality and reality itself. (Source: R. Diekstra, ''Haarlemmer Dagblad'', 1993, cited by L. Derks &amp; J. Hollander, ''Essenties van NLP'' (Utrecht: Servire, 1996), p. 58).

== Impact ==
Korzybski's work influenced [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] (especially the [[metamodel]]), [[Gestalt Therapy]], [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] and individuals such as [[Albert Ellis]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Alvin Toffler]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], Tommy Hall (lyricist for the [[13th Floor Elevators]]), and scientists such as William Alanson White (psychiatry), and W. Horsley Gantt (a student and colleague of Pavlov).

'''''Asteroids''''' is a popular [[vector graphics|vector-based]] video [[arcade game]] released in 1979 by [[Atari Games|Atari]]. The object of the game is for the player to shoot and destroy [[asteroid]]s without being hit by the fragments. It was one of the most popular and influential games of the [[Golden Age of Arcade Games]].

==Description==

''Asteroids'' was inspired, in a roundabout way, by the seminal ''[[Spacewar]]'', the first computer-based video game. In the early 1980s a stand-up arcade game version was produced as ''Space Wars'', which included a number of optional versions and added a floating asteroid as a visual device. ''Asteroids'' is essentially a one-player version of Spacewar, featuring the &quot;wedge&quot; ship from the original and promoting the asteroids to be the main opponent.

The game was conceived by [[Lyle Rains]] and programmed by [[Ed Logg]]. ''Asteroids'' was a hit in the [[United States]] and became one of Atari's best selling games of all time. Atari had been in the process of releasing a vector beam version of ''[[Lunar Lander]]'', but demand for ''Asteroids'' was so high they simply pulled them apart and converted them over. Today the ''Lunar Lander'' version is difficult to find. ''Asteroids'' was so popular that [[video arcade]] owners usually had to install larger boxes to hold all the coins this machine raked in.

One feature of the game was the ability for players to record their initials with their high scores, an innovation which is standard in arcade games to this day.

''Asteroids'' was the first of several games to use Atari's &quot;Quadra-Scan&quot; vector-refresh system (although a [[Raster graphics|raster-based]] full-color version was developed for the [[Atari 2600]] home video game system). Later full-color Quadra-Scan games would include ''[[Tempest (game)|Tempest]]''.

==Features==

The player's controls consisted of thrust and fire buttons, and rotate left/rotate right buttons (actually rotate counterclockwise and rotate clockwise respectively).  The momentum of the player's ship was not conserved, and it would start to slow down if thrust was not applied.  There was also a [[hyperspace]] button, which randomly teleported the player's ship somewhere on the screen, with the risk of exploding upon rematerialization (or rematerializing inside an asteroid).

The player's ship spawned in the middle of the screen, with 4 large asteroids drifting around.  Each large asteroid (20 points) would break into 2 medium-sized ones (50 points) when shot, which in turn would break into 2 small (100 points) asteroids.  The medium and small asteroids, once &quot;spawned&quot;, could travel at widely varying speeds. Periodically one of two types of flying saucers (&quot;UFOs&quot;) would fly onto the screen: the big one (worth 200 points) would shoot in random directions, while the small one (1000 points) would attempt to aim at the player; they tended to appear more often when few asteroids remained on the screen and/or the player hadn't shot an asteroid recently.  The screen wrapped around, allowing the player's ship, as well as asteroids and shots but not saucers, to fly off the one edge of the screen and reappear on the opposite side.  Once a level had been cleared of all asteroids and UFOs, a new set of large asteroids would appear, increasing by 2 each round up to a maximum of 12.

The maximum score possible was 99,990 points, after which it turned back over to zero.  A player who desired to get onto the top score list then had to be careful to shoot just enough asteroids/UFOs to reach this score without going over (including committing suicide with the last ship left to reach the final total!).

On some early versions of the game it was possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids.

==Lurking==
[[Image:Asteroids UFO.svg|thumb|right|150px|The small UFO is the key to high scores for many advanced players.]]
Soon after the release of ''Asteroids'', some players discovered that small UFOs would be continually sent out when the asteroid count decreased to a certain level. Since these UFOs were worth 1,000 points each - a significant sum on this game - a strategy known as &quot;lurking&quot; soon developed around this. Players would shoot asteroids until there was only one small or mid-sized rock remaining, and then maneuver the ship to a spot approximately one inch from any corner of the screen. Small UFOs would then be ambushed as soon as they emerged (and before they were able to return fire), using wraparound fire if necessary.  Because the small UFOs were unable to &quot;lead&quot; the player's ship with their fire (i.e. aiming ahead of the ship's flight path), a clever player could manuever, if necessary, in such a way as to virtually ensure they would never be hit by the small UFO (in fact the large UFO in a sense was seen as more of a threat precisely because of its unpredictable random shots).  Since each 10,000 points awarded an extra life, players could continue almost indefinitely once the practice had been mastered. [http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Esquire2-81-pg62.htm] The designers abolished this practice in ''Asteroids Deluxe'' by causing the UFOs to either shoot at the remaining asteroids, thus ending the round, or shoot at the player as soon as they appeared on the screen-they also gained the ability to lead the player's ship as well, making them much more dangerous.

However it was also possible to succeed by shooting the asteroids instead; a shrewd &quot;asteroid hunting&quot; player would typically attempt to kill all the asteroids &quot;inside&quot; a large one before shooting another asteroid, thus minimizing the amount of &quot;clutter&quot; on the screen.

==Technical Description==
The ''Asteroids'' arcade machine is a so-called [[vector game]]. This means that the game graphics are composed entirely of lines which are drawn on a [[vector monitor]]. The hardware consists primarily of a standard [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which executes the game program, and the [[Atari Digital Vector Generator|Digital Vector Generator]] (DVG), vector processing [[circuitry]] developed by [[Atari]] themselves. As the 6502 by itself was too slow to control both the game play and the vector hardware at the same time, the latter task was delegated to the DVG.

For each picture frame, the 6502 writes graphics commands for the DVG into a defined area of [[RAM]] (the vector RAM), and then asks the DVG to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen. The DVG reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor. There are DVG commands for positioning the cathode ray, for drawing a line to a specified destination, calling a subroutine with further commands, and so on.

''Asteroids'' also features various sound effects, each of which is implemented by its own [[circuitry]]. The CPU activates these audio [[electrical network|circuits]] (and other hardware components) by writing to special memory addresses (memory mapped ports). The inputs from the player's controls (buttons) are also mapped into the CPU [[address space]]

The main ''Asteroids'' game program uses only 4 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code. Another 4 KB of vector ROM contain the descriptions of the main graphical elements (rocks, saucer, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits) in the form of DVG commands.

==Legacy==
The gameplay in ''Asteroids'' was imitated by many games that followed. For example, one of the objects of ''[[Sinistar]]'' is to shoot asteroids in order to get them to release resources which the player needs to collect.

Due to its success, ''Asteroids'' was followed by three sequels:
* ''[[Asteroids Deluxe]]'' (1980)
* ''[[Space Duel]]'' (1982)
* ''[[Blasteroids]]'' (1987)

However, the original game was by far the most popular of the series.

The [[Killer List of Videogames]] (KLOV) credits this game as one of the &quot;Top 100 Videogames.&quot;  Readers of the KLOV credit it as the seventh most popular game.

==Ports==
Being one of the most popular video games ever, ''Asteroids'' has been ported to multiple systems, including many of [[Atari]]'s systems ([[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200|5200]], [[Atari 7800|7800]], [[Atari Lynx]]) and many others. The 2600 port was the first game to utilize a bank-switched cartridge, doubling available ROM space. Also, a new version of ''Asteroids'' was developed for [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and the [[Game Boy Color]] in the late 1990s. A port was also included on Atari's [[Atari Cosmos|Cosmos]] system, but the system never saw release. Many of the recent [[TV Games]] series of old Atari games have included either the 2600 or arcade versions of ''Asteroids''. Atari has also used the game for its other late '90s anthology series. Essentially, if one looks for this game, one will be able to find it somewhere.

In 2005, ''Asteroids'' (Including both [[Atari 2600]] and the arcade original, along with [[Asteroids Deluxe]]) were included as part of ''[[Atari Anthology]]'' for both [[XBox]] and [[Playstation 2]], using Digital Eclipse's emulation technology..

===Unofficial clones and variants===

[[Image:NovaBombs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Avenger class fighter unleashes nova bombs in Starscape.]]

There have been countless unofficial versions of ''Asteroids'' produced. These include near-copies such as [[Acornsoft|Acornsoft's]] ''[[Meteors (game)|Meteors]]'', as well as those with expanded gameplay and background, such as ''[[Stardust (game)|Stardust]]'' and ''[[Starscape]]''.

==Record breaking gameplay==
In March 2004, [[Portland, Oregon]] resident '''Bill Carlton''' attempted to break the world record for playing an arcade version of ''Asteroids'', playing over 27 hours before his machine malfunctioned, ending his record run. He scored 12.7 million points, putting him in 5th place in the all-time ''Asteroids'' rankings. In November 1982 '''Scott Safran''' set the still unbroken record of 41 million points.

==Song==
In 1982, [[Buckner and Garcia]] recorded a song titled &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, using sound effects from the game, and released it on the album ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]''.

'''Asparagales''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[monocot]]s which includes a number of  families of non-woody plants. In older classification systems, the families now included in the Asparagales were included in order [[Liliales]], and some genera of which were even included in family [[Liliaceae]]. Some classification systems separate some of the families listed below into additional orders, including orders [[Orchidales]] and [[Iridales]], while other systems, especially the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]]'s classification system, include the Orchidales and Iridales within the Asparagales. The order is named after the genus ''[[Asparagus (genus)|Asparagus]]''.

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group's classification system is widely used by botanists, and was updated as the APG II in 2002 to include recent findings, especially in [[DNA]] analysis. Their 1998 scheme identified 29 families in order Asparagales. The APG II consolidates some families, and recognizes an alternative system of fewer, larger families, in which certain smaller families can be grouped within other larger families based on close genetic affinities and still follow the 'APG system'. Under the new classification system one could, for example, correctly include daylilies (''[[Hemerocallis]]'') in family [[Hemerocallidaceae]], or in family [[Xanthorrhoeaceae]]. The APG II classification of the Asparagales is as follows: 
*[[Alliaceae]]
**[[Agapanthaceae]]
**[[Amaryllidaceae]]
*[[Asparagaceae]]
**[[Agavaceae]]
**[[Aphyllanthaceae]]
**[[Hesperocallidaceae]]
**[[Hyacinthaceae]]
**[[Laxmanniaceae]]

*[[Iridaceae]]
*[[Ixioliriaceae]]
*[[Lanariaceae]]
*[[Orchidaceae]]
*[[Tecophilaeaceae]]
*[[Xanthorrhoeaceae]]
**[[Asphodelaceae]]
**[[Hemerocallidaceae]]

Classification systems that separate the Asparagales, Orchidales and Iridales are generally organized as follows:
* Asparagales, narrow sense
** Family [[Asparagaceae]] ([[asparagus]] family)
** Family [[Alliaceae]] (onion family)
*** [[Chives]]

The order '''Alismatales''' contains the alismatids, a group of [[monocotyledon]]s (class [[Liliopsida]]). The order contains about 165 genera in 14 families, with cosmopolitic distribution. Most families are comprised of [[herb]]aceous non-[[succulent]] plants. These plants are commonly found in aquatic environmments. The [[flower]]s are usually arranged in [[inflorescence]]s, and the mature seeds lack [[endosperm]].

Traditionally, the order Alismatales was restricted to contain just three families (Alismataceae, Butomaceae and Limnocharitaceae). The other families were not considered as alismatids, and were assigned to various distinct orders, but this approach produced [[polyphyletic]] groups, and so the whole group of families is now placed into a single order. 

The [[Petrosaviaceae]] have been placed in this order, but their actual affinity is not so clear. The alismatids have been considered the sister group of the [[Arales]] and the latter are now included here. As a result of this merger, the Araceae became the most important family in the order, accounting alone for over 2000 species in about 100 genera. The rest of families contain together just about 500 species.

The '''Apiales''' are an order of [[flowering plant]]s. The families given at right are typical of newer classifications, though there is some slight variation, and in particular the Torriceliaceae may be divided. These families are placed within the asterid group of [[dicotyledon]]s.

Under the older [[Cronquist system]], only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The Pittosporaceae were placed within the [[Rosales]], and the other forms within the family [[Cornaceae]].

The '''Asterales''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[dicotyledon]]ous [[flowering plant]]s which include the composite family [[Asteraceae]] ([[sunflower]]s and [[Bellis|daisies]]) and its related families.

The order is cosmopolitic, and includes mostly herbaceous species, although  a small number of trees (''Lobelia'') and shrubs is also present.

The Asterales can be characterized on the morphological and molecular level. Synapomorphies include the [[oligosaccharide]] [[inulin]] as the nutrients storage, and the stamens are usually aggregated densely around the style or even are fused into a tube around it. The last property is probably associated with the plunger (or secondary) [[pollination]], which is common among the families of the order.

== Families ==
The '''Asterales''' include about eleven families, the largest of which is [[Asteraceae]] with about 25,000 species, and [[Campanulaceae]] with about 2,000 species. The remaining families count together for less than 500 species. The two large families are cosmopolitic with center of mass in the northern hemisphere, and the smaller ones are usually confined to Australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes the South America.

Under the [[Cronquist system]], [[Asteraceae]] was the only family in the group, but newer systems (e. g. [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]] II) have expanded it.

==Evolution and biogeography==
The Asterales order probably originated in [[Cretaceous]] on the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], in the area which is now Australia and Asia. Although most extant species are herbaceous, the examination of the basal families in the order suggests that the common ancestor of the order was an arborescent plant.

Fossil evidence of the Asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epoques, so the precise estimation of the order's age is quite difficult. An [[Oligocene]] pollen is known for Asteraceae and Goodeniaceae, and seeds from Oligocene and [[Miocene]] are known for Menyanthaceae and Campanulaceae respectively.

(Bremer and Gustafsson, 1997)

==Economical importance==
The Asteraceae include some species grown for food, e. g. [[sunflower]] (''Helianthus annuus'') or [[chicory]] (''Cichorium''). Many spices and medicinal herbs are also present.

Of horticultural importance are the Asteraceae (e. g. [[chrysanthemum]]) and Campanulaceae.

An '''asteroid''' is a small, solid object in our [[Solar System]], orbiting the [[Sun]]. An asteroid is an example of a [[minor planet]] (or '''planetoid'''), which are much smaller than [[planet]]s. Most asteroids are believed to be remnants of the [[protoplanetary disc]] which were not incorporated into planets during the system's formation due to excessive gravitational perturbations by [[Jupiter]]. Some asteroids have [[Asteroid moon|moon]]s. The vast majority of the asteroids are within the main [[asteroid belt]], with [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits between those of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. [[image:433eros.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as 35 m across can be seen.]]



==Asteroids in the solar system==
[[Image:4 Vesta 1 Ceres Moon at 20 km per px.png|thumb|right|Left to right: [[4 Vesta]], [[1 Ceres]], Earth's [[Moon]].]]
Hundreds of thousands of asteroids have been discovered within the solar system, and the present rate of discovery is about 5000 per month. As of [[February 23]], [[2006]], from a total of 325,627 &lt;!--- astorb.dat record count ---&gt; registered minor planets, 120,437 have orbits known well enough to be given [[asteroid naming conventions|permanent official numbers]]. Of these, 12890&lt;!--- using http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/MPNames.html ---&gt; have official names (trivia: at least 610 of these names require [[diacritic]]s). The lowest-numbered but unnamed minor planet is [[(3360) 1981 VA]]; the highest-numbered named minor planet is [[117506 Wildberg]] [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/NumberedMPs115001.html].

Current estimates put the total number of asteroids in the solar system at several million. The largest asteroid in the inner solar system is [[1 Ceres]], with a diameter of 900-1000 km. Two other large inner solar system belt asteroids are [[2 Pallas]] and [[4 Vesta]]; both have diameters of ~500 km. Vesta is the only main belt asteroid that is sometimes visible to the naked eye (in some very rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may be visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]]).

The mass of all the asteroids of the Main Belt is estimated to be about 2.3x10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, or about 3% of the mass of our moon. Of this, [[1 Ceres]] comprises 940 to 950x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, some 40% of the total. Adding in the next three most massive asteroids, [[4 Vesta]] (12%), [[2 Pallas]] (9%), and [[10 Hygiea]] (4%), bring this figure up 66%; while the three after that, [[511 Davida]] (1.6%), [[704 Interamnia]] (1.4%), and [[3 Juno]] (1.2%), only add another 4% to the total mass. The number of asteroids then increases [[Exponential distribution|exponentially]] as their individual masses decrease. 

See also a [[List of noteworthy asteroids]] in our Solar System, or a sequentially-ordered [[List of asteroids]].

==Asteroid classification==
Asteroids are commonly classified into groups based on the characteristics of their orbits and on the details of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]] of sunlight they reflect.

===Orbit groups and families===
:''main articles: [[asteroid family]] and [[minor planet]]''

Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are much &quot;tighter&quot; and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.

For a full listing of known asteroid groups and families, see [[minor planet]] and [[asteroid family]].

===Spectral classification===
[[Image:253 Mathilde small.jpg|thumb|right|[[253 Mathilde]], a [[C-type asteroid]].]]
In 1975, an asteroid [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] system based on [[colour]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]]. These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. Originally, they classified only three types of asteroids:

*[[C-type asteroid]]s - carbonaceous, 75% of known asteroids
*[[S-type asteroid]]s - silicaceous, 17% of known asteroids
*[[M-type asteroid]]s - metallic, most of the remaining asteroids

This list has since been expanded to include a number of other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied. See [[Asteroid spectral types]] for more detail or [[:Category:Asteroid spectral classes]] for a list.

Note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

====Problems with spectral classification====

Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition:

* C - [[carbonate|Carbonaceous]]
* S - [[silicate|Silicaceous]]
* M - [[Metallic]]

However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and there are a variety of classifications in use. This has led to significant confusion. While asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.

At present, the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the 1990s is still the standard. Scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system, largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids (e.g. finer resolution spectra, or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful).

==Asteroid discovery==
===Historical discovery methods===
Asteroid discovery methods have drastically improved over the past two centuries. 

In the last years of the [[18th century]], Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the &quot;missing planet&quot; predicted at about 2.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]] by the [[Titius-Bode law]], partly as a consequence of the discovery, by Sir [[William Herschel]] in [[1781]], of the planet [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] at the distance &quot;predicted&quot; by the law. This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the [[zodiac]]al band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour, readily discernable by observers.

Ironically, the first asteroid, [[1 Ceres]], was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in [[1801]] by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] director, at the time, of the observatory of [[Palermo]], in [[Sicily]]. He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. His colleague, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], used these observations to determine the exact distance from this unknown object to the Earth. Gauss' calculations placed the object between the planets [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Piazzi named it after [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture.

Three other asteroids ([[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], [[4 Vesta]]) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in [[1807]]. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.

However, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in [[1830]]. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. M. S. Goldschmidt]], [[Jean Chacornac]], [[James Ferguson (astronomer)|James Ferguson]], [[Norman Robert Pogson]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel|E. W. Tempel]], [[James Craig Watson|J. C. Watson]], [[Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C. H. F. Peters]], [[Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly|A. Borrelly]], [[Johann Palisa|J. Palisa]], [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry]] and [[Auguste Charlois]].

In [[1891]], however, [[Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf|Max Wolf]] pioneered the use of [[astrophotography]] to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This drastically increased the rate of detection compared with previous visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. Still, a century later, only a few thousand asteroids were identified, numbered and named. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, calling them &quot;vermin of the skies&quot;.

===Modern discovery methods===
Until [[1998]], asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was [[photograph]]ed by a wide-field [[telescope]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two [[film]]s of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would appear to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations [http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker/].

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an [[apparition]], which gets a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a code of two letters representing the week of discovery, and of a number so more than the one discovered one took place in this week (example: 1998 FJ74). 

The final step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to [[Brian Marsden]] of the [[Minor Planet Center]]. Dr. Marsden has computer programs that compute whether an apparition ties together previous apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object gets a number. The observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and he gets the honour of naming the asteroid (subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]]) once it is numbered.

===Latest technology: detecting hazardous asteroids===
There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth|Earth's]] orbit, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth (see [[Earth-crosser asteroid]]s). The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor_asteroid|Amors]], and the [[Aten_asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed.

The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as [[1898]], and the [[1930]]s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] of the [[Earth]] in [[1937]]. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the level of alarm: the increasing acceptance of [[Walter Alvarez]]' theory of [[K-T extinction|dinosaur extinction]] being due to an [[impact event]], and the [[1994]] observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its military satellites, built to detect nuclear explosions, had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across.

All of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of Charge-Coupled Device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. Since [[1998]], a large majority of the asteroids have been discovered by such automated systems. A list of teams using such automated systems includes [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs]:

* The [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) team
* The [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT) team
* [[Spacewatch]]
* The [[LONEOS|Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS) team
* The [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (CSS)
* The [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Objects Survey]] (CINEOS) team
* The [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]]
* The [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]] (ADAS)

The LINEAR system alone has discovered 62,283 asteroids as of [[December 14]], [[2005]] [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/MPDiscSites.html]. Between all of the automated systems, 3868 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Unusual.html] including over 600 more than 1 km in diameter.

==Naming asteroids==
===The naming format===
Newly discovered asteroids are given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code, such as 2001 FH. When its orbit is confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[1 Ceres]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. ''(433) Eros''), however, dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, especially when a name is repeated in running text, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention.

The [[Minor Planet Circular]] (MPC) of [[October 19]], [[2005]] was a historical one, as it saw the highest numbered asteroid jump from 99947 to 118161, causing a small &quot;[[Y2k]]&quot; like crisis for various automated data services &amp;mdash;up until then, only five digits were allowed in most data formats for the asteroid number. This has been addressed in some data fields by having the leftmost digit, the ten-thousands place, use the alphabet as a digit extension. A=10, B=11,‚Ä¶, Z=35, a=36,‚Ä¶, z=61. The highest number 120437 thus is cross-referenced as C0437 on some lists. Also, the fictional asteroid of ''[[The Little Prince]]'', '''B612''', now could be connected with the real (110612) 2001 TA&lt;sub&gt;142&lt;/sub&gt; which is listed as (B0612) 2001 TA&lt;sub&gt;142&lt;/sub&gt; in the compacted lists &amp;mdash;although it is already present as [[46610 B√©sixdouze]] (B612 in hexadecimal translates to 46610 in decimal notation).

===Unnamed asteroids===
Unnamed asteroids that have been given a number keep their provisional designation, e.g. [[(29075) 1950 DA]].

As modern discovery techniques have discovered vast numbers of new asteroids, they are increasingly being left unnamed. The first asteroid to be left unnamed was [[(3360) 1981 VA]]. On rare occasions, an asteroid's [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] may become used as a name in itself: the still unnamed [[(15760) 1992 QB‚ÇÅ]] gave its name to a group of asteroids which became known as [[cubewano]]s.

===Sources for names===
The first few asteroids were named after figures from [[Graeco-Roman mythology]], but as such names started to run out, others were used &amp;mdash;famous people, literary characters, the names of the discoverer's wives,  children, and even television characters. 

The first asteroid to be given a non-mythological name was [[20 Massalia]], named after the city of [[Marseille|Marseilles]]. For some time only female (or feminized) names were used; [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first man to have an asteroid named after him, but his name was feminized to [[54 Alexandra]]. This unspoken tradition lasted until [[334 Chicago]] was named; even then, oddly feminised names show up in the list for years afterward.

As the number of asteroids began to run into the hundreds, and eventually the thousands, discoverers began to give them increasingly frivolous names. The first hints of this were [[482 Petrina]] and [[483 Seppina]], named after the discoverer's pet dogs. However, there was little controversy about this until [[1971]], upon the naming of [[2309 Mr. Spock]] (which was not even named after the ''[[Star Trek]]'' character, but after the discoverer's cat who supposedly bore a resemblance to him). Although the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] subsequently banned pet names as sources, eccentric asteroid names are still being proposed and accepted, such as [[6042 Cheshirecat]], [[9007 James Bond]], or [[26858 Misterrogers]].

For a full list, see [[meanings of asteroid names]].

===Special naming rules===
Asteroid naming is not always a free-for-all: there are some types of asteroid for which rules have developed about the sources of names. For instance [[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaurs]] (asteroids orbiting between Saturn and Neptune) are all named after mythological [[centaur]]s, [[Trojan asteroid|Trojans]] after heroes from the [[Trojan War]], and [[trans-Neptunian objects]] after underworld spirits.

==Asteroid symbols==
The first few asteroids discovered were assigned symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate Earth, the Moon, the Sun and planets. The symbols quickly became ungainly, hard to draw and recognise. By the end of [[1851]] there were 15 known asteroids, each (except one) with its own symbol. The first four's main variants are shown here:

:1 Ceres [[Image:1 Ceres (0).png|15px|Old planetary symbol of Ceres]] [[Image:1 Ceres (1).png|15px|Variant symbol of Ceres]] [[Image:1 Ceres (2).png|15px|Sickle variant symbol of Ceres]] [[Image:1 Ceres (3).png|20px|Other sickle variant symbol of Ceres]]
:2 Pallas [[Image:2 Pallas (0).png|15px|Old symbol of Pallas]] [[Image:2 Pallas (1).png|15px|Variant symbol of Pallas]]
:3 Juno [[Image:3 Juno (0).png|15px|Old symbol of Juno]] [[Image:3 Juno (1).png|15px|Other symbol of Juno]]
:4 Vesta [[Image:4 Vesta (0).png|15px|Old symbol of Vesta]] [[Image:100px-Simbolo di Vesta.jpg|15px|Old planetary symbol of Vesta]] [[Image:4 Vesta (1).png|15px|Modern astrological symbol of Vesta]]

[[Johann Franz Encke]] made a major change in the ''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'' (BAJ, &quot;Berlin Astronomical Yearbook&quot;) for [[1854]]. He introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols, although his numbering began with [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols. This symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community. The following year ([[1855]]), Astraea's number was bumped up to 5, but Ceres through Vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the [[1867]] edition. A few more asteroids ([[28 Bellona]], [[35 Leukothea]], and [[37 Fides]]) would be given symbols as well as using the numbering scheme.

The circle would become a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades.

For details, see [[James L. Hilton]], [[2001]], [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html ''When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets?''].

==Asteroid exploration==
Until the age of [[space travel]], asteroids were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. 

The first [[close-up]] photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in [[1971]] when the [[Mariner 9]] probe imaged [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the two small moons of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did subsequent images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.

[[Image:951 Gaspra.jpg|thumb|right|[[951 Gaspra]], the first asteroid to be imaged in close up.]]
The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in [[1991]], followed in [[1993]] by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo probe]] ''en route'' to [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. 

The first dedicated asteroid probe was [[NEAR Shoemaker]], which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in [[1997]], before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in [[2001]].

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft ''en route'' to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by [[Deep Space 1]] in [[1999]]), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] in [[2002]]).

In September [[2005]], the Japanese [[Hayabusa]] probe started studying [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and will return samples of its surface to earth. Following that, the next asteroid encounters will involve the European [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta probe]] (launched in [[2004]]), which will study [[2867 Steins|2867 &amp;#352;teins]] and [[21 Lutetia]] in [[2008]] and [[2010]]. 

As a consequence of cost overruns and technical problems, [[NASA]] cancelled its [[Dawn Mission]] in March, 2006.  Dawn was originally scheduled to launch June 2006 (later rescheduled for 2007) and was to orbit both [[1 Ceres]] and [[4 Vesta]] in [[2011]]-[[2015]].

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used in the future as a source of materials which may be rare or exhausted on earth ([[asteroid mining]]).

==Asteroids in fiction and film==
Understandably, most fictional depictions of asteroids focus on their potential risk of striking Earth. Representations of the asteroid belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks; in reality asteroids, even in the main belt, are spaced extremely far apart.

*[[Professor Moriarty]], [[Sherlock Holmes]]' arch-enemy, &quot;is the celebrated author of'' &quot;The Dynamics of an Asteroid&quot;'', a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it&quot; ([[The Valley of Fear]], [[1914]], set in [[1888]]).
*In ''[[The Little Prince]]'', a [[1943]] novel by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry]], the [[title role|title character]] lives on an asteroid named &quot;B-6-12&quot;. The [[asteroid moon]] [[Petit-Prince (asteroid)|Petit-Prince]] was named after the character, and [[46610 B√©sixdouze]] after his asteroid.
*'[[Catch that Rabbit]]', one of the short stories in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s collection ''[[I, Robot]]'' ([[1950]]), takes place on an asteroid, while ''[[Marooned Off Vesta]],'' Asimov's first published story, concerns the plight of a group of astronauts stranded in orbit around the asteroid [[4 Vesta]].
*The Japanese science fiction film ''[[Chikyu Boeigun|The Mysterians]]'' aka ''[[Chikyu Boeigun]]'' ([[1957]]) reveals the solar system's asteroid belt as the remnants of the Mysterian's home planet, Mysteroid, after a nuclear war broke out.
*In ''[[Green Slime]]'' (1968), a masterpiece of [[B-movie]]s, a rogue asteroid hurtles toward Earth. The astronauts leave [[Space station|Space Station]] Gamma 3 and place bombs on the asteroid, finding it inhabited by strange blobs of glowing slime that are drawn to the equipment. Unfortunately for everyone some of the slime was carried back on a [[space suit]] and soon evolves into tentacled creatures! See the review: [http://www.badmovies.org/movies/greenslime/]. The movie inspired the classic [[board game]] ''[[Awful Green Things from Outer Space]]''.
*In the classic science-fiction movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968]]), the ''Discovery'' has a scientifically accurate &quot;close approach&quot; by a binary asteroid whilst en route to [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. The scene simply cuts briefly to two lone rocks passing by the ship, with tens of thousands of kilometres to spare.
* In [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]'s ''Inherit the Stars'' ([[1977]]), first book of the ''Gentle Giants'' series, Minerva was a planet that exploded to form the [[asteroid belt]] 50,000 years ago.
*The [[disaster movie]] ''[[Meteor (movie)|Meteor]]'' ([[1979]]) depicts an asteroid named Orpheus hurtling toward Earth after its orbit is deflected by a [[comet]].
*[[Atari]] released the arcade game [[Asteroids]] in [[1979]].
*In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' ([[1980]]), [[Han Solo]] enters an asteroid field to flee from the [[Empire_(Star_Wars)|Imperial]] fleet, and [[C-3PO]] thinks it is a bad idea. Han then hides his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' inside a giant asteroid; The ship is then attacked by a vast monster that lives (inexplicably) within the asteroid in the vacuum of space.
*In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[Ender's Game]]'' ([[1985]]), a school on [[433 Eros]] is dedicated to children learning to become fleet commanders.
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' ([[1986]]) depicts a journey through the asteroid belt and its ominous parallels with the journey of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.
*[[L. Neil Smith]]'s novel ''Pallas'' ([[Tor Books]], [[1993]]) depicts a modernized hunting based life on the terraformed asteroid [[Pallas]] and introduces Emerson Ngu.  The book was partly insired by the 1987 article &quot;The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race&quot; written by [[Jared Diamond]]. The book also includes a brief description of a way to encapsulate the entire surface of a small body such as an asteroid to enable creating an Earthlike environment.
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[The Hammer of God]]'' ([[1993]]) depicts mankind's efforts to stop an asteroid named Kali from hitting the Earth. The film ''[[Deep Impact (movie)|Deep Impact]]'' ([[1998]]) was based on Clarke's novel, although in the movie, the asteroid becomes a [[comet]].
*In the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[The Dig]]'' (originally released in [[1995]]) and its novelization, the impact-threatening asteroid Attila turns out to be an alien probe.
*In the [[1998]] movie ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', aliens launch an asteroid at Earth, completely wiping out [[Buenos Aires]]. This is the opening move in the war.
*The film ''[[Armageddon (movie)|Armageddon]]'' (1998) is also about efforts to stop an asteroid hitting Earth. Its representation of an asteroid (and of space travel in general) is deeply unrealistic.
*[[Ben Bova]]'s novel series ''[[The Asteroid Wars]]'' ([[2001]]-[[2004]]) focuses on a war over the mining of the asteroid belt.
*In the [[BBC]] [[drama documentary]] ''[[Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets]]'' ([[2004]]), the ''Pegasus'' encounters a [[binary asteroid]] from much closer than expected, and dubs the rocks &quot;Hubris&quot; and &quot;Catastrophe&quot; as a result.
*An episode of the political television drama, ''[[The West Wing (television)|The West Wing]]'' entitled &quot;Impact Winter&quot; included a subplot in which the [[White House]] staff prepared for a possible asteroid strike on the Earth. (First broadcast on [[December 15]], [[2004]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally, '''to allocute''' means &quot;to speak out formally.&quot;  In the field of [[apologetics]], allocution is generally done in defense of a belief.  In politics, one may allocute before a legislative body in an effort to influence their position on an issue.  In law, it is generally meant to state specifically and in detail what one did &lt;nowiki&gt;and/or&lt;/nowiki&gt; why, often in relation to commission of a crime.

In most jurisdictions, a defendant is allowed the opportunity to allocute &amp;mdash; that is, explain himself, before sentence is passed.  Some jurisdictions hold this as an absolute right, and in its absence, a sentence may potentially be overturned, with the result that a new sentencing hearing must be held.

Allocution is sometimes required of a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime in a [[plea bargain]] in exchange for a reduced sentence.  In this instance, allocution can serve to provide closure for victims or their families.  In principle, it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.  However, there have been many cases in which the defendant allocuted to a crime that he did not commit, often because this is a requirement to receiving a lesser sentence.

The term &quot;allocution&quot; is generally only in use in jurisdictions in the United States, though there are similar processes in other nations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''affidavit''' is a formal sworn statement of fact, written down, signed, and witnessed (as to the veracity of the signature) by a taker of oaths, such as a [[notary public]]. The name is [[Medieval Latin]] for  ''he has declared upon oath''.

One use of affidavits is to allow evidence to be gathered from witnesses or participants that may not be available to testify in person before the court.  

In American [[jurisprudence]], it is very unusual to allow an unsupported affidavit to be entered into evidence (as the person sworn in the affidavit is not subject to cross-examination) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter [[at bar]].  Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of [[corroborating evidence]].  A formerly written affidavit, which reflected a better grasp of the facts closer in time to the actual events, may be used to refresh a witness' recollection.  Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence.

Some types of motions will not be accepted by a court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence, in support of the need for the motion.  In such a case, the court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit:  The affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes [[judicial economy]].  The lawyer is an [[officer of the court]] and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including [[disbarment]].  The lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit.



== In the United Kingdom ==
Affidavits are made by writing &quot;I (state full name) of (insert address)on this date (date in words) make oath and say as follows...&quot;.  After this has been written, the facts to be sworn are listed, in pros or in bullet points.  The document is then taken to a [[commisssioner for oaths]] (most [[solicitors]] are also commissioners for oaths).  They will then ask you to swear on a holy book particular to your faith ([[The New Testament]], [[The Old Testament]], the [[Qur'an]], etc) and ask you to verify what has been stated.

An Affidavit is of equivalent value to sworn testimony.

'''Aries''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[sheep|Ram]]'', symbol [[Image:Aries_symbol.png|20px]], [[Unicode]] ‚ôà) is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]].  It lies between [[Pisces]] to the west and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the east.

== Notable features ==
Aries' stars are rather faint except for [[Alpha Arietis|&amp;alpha; Ari]] (Hamal) and [[Beta Arietis|&amp;beta; Ari]] (Sharatan). Other important stars are [[Gamma Arietis|&amp;gamma; Ari]] (Mesarthim) and [[Delta Arietis|&amp;delta; Ari]] (Botein).

[[Teegarden's star]], in Aries, is one of our sun's closest neighbours.

The few [[deep sky object]]s in Aries are very dim. They include the [[galaxy|galaxies]] NGC 697 (northwest of &amp;beta;), NGC 772 (southeast of &amp;beta;), NGC 972 (in the constellation's northern corner), and NGC 1156 (northwest of &amp;delta;).

== Mythology ==
When including fainter stars, visible to the naked eye, the area resembles the head of a [[sheep|ram]], having a general herbivore head shape and a spiral horn.

In [[Greek mythology]], this is believed to represent the ram which carried Athamas's son [[Phrixus]] and daughter [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]] to Colchis to escape their stepmother [[Ino]]. Helle fell off into the sea which later became the Hellespont. On reaching safety, Phrixis sacrificed the ram and hung its [[golden fleece|fleece]] in the Grove of Ares, where it turned to gold and later became the quest of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. It appears that [[Babylonians]], [[Greeks]], [[Persians]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] all agreed on the name of the Ram for this [[constellation]].

The main area of the sky constituting the sign of Aries, containing part of [[Pisces]], the [[Pleiades]], and the constellation of [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], may be the origin of the myth of the girdle of [[Hippolyte]], which forms part of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].

===Astrology===
The Western [[astrological sign]] Aries of the [[tropical zodiac]] ([[March 21]]&amp;ndash;[[April 19]]) differs from the astronomical constellation and the Hindu astrological sign of the [[Sidereal astrology|sidereal zodiac]] ([[April 19]] - [[May 13]]).

In some cosmologies, Aries is associated with the [[classical element]] [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], and thus called a fire sign (along with [[Sagittarius]] and [[Leo]]). It is the [[domicile (astrology)|domicile]] of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and the [[Exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]] of the [[Sun]]. It is also one of the four [[Cardinal sign]]s (along with [[Libra]], [[Capricorn]], and [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]]). Its polar opposite is [[Libra]]. Each astrological sign is assigned a part of the body, viewed as the seat of its power. Aries rules the head and face. The symbol for Aries is the [[sheep|ram]].

'''Aquarius''' ([[Latin]] for the ''[[Water]]-bearer'' or ''Cup-bearer'', symbol [[Image:Aquarius_symbol_small.png|20px]], [[Unicode]] ‚ôí) is the eleventh sign of the [[zodiac]],  situated between Capricornus and Pisces.  Its symbol is [[Image:Aquarius_symbol_small.png|20px]], representing part of a stream of water. 

Aquarius is one of the oldest recognized constellations along the zodiac, the sun's apparent path. It is found in a region often called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] due to its profusion of watery constellations such as [[Cetus]], [[Pisces]], [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], etc. Sometimes, the river Eridanus is depicted spilling from Aquarius' watering pot.

== Notable deep sky objects ==
There are three [[deep sky object]]s that are on the [[Messier object|Messier catalog]], the [[Globular Cluster M2]], [[Globular Cluster M72]], and the [[Messier Object 73|Open Cluster M73]].

Two [[planetary nebula]]e are found in Aquarius: [[NGC 7009]], called the [[Saturn Nebula]] due to its resemblance to the [[Saturn (planet)|planet]], to the southeast of &amp;eta; Aquarii; and [[NGC 7293]], the famous [[Helix Nebula]], southwest of &amp;delta; Aquarii.

== History ==
The constellation was immortalized in the [[1960s]], proclaimed the [[Age of Aquarius]]. However, there is no standard definition for astrological ages, so the age of Aquarius could begin in [[2150]] or even [[2660]], depending on the preferred definition.  Based on the modern constellation boundaries of [[Pisces]] and Aquarius, the age of Aquarius would begin around 2660.

However, with so much of modern society reflecting the qualities of Aquarius most astrologers believe that this era has begun. Mass production, electricity, flight and space travel, electronic communications including computers the Internet, even the growing movement against capitalism in favour of a more socialist system of humanitarian development are all related to the Aquarian paradigm.

== Mythology ==
The best-known myth identifies Aquarius with [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a beautiful youth with whom [[Zeus]] fell in love, and whom he (in the guise of an eagle, represented as the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]) carried off to Olympus to be cupbearer to the gods. [[Crater (constellation)|Crater]] is sometimes identified as his cup. 

Aquarius generally resembles the figure of a man, and when considering fainter humanly visible stars, it takes on the image of a man with a bucket from which is pouring a stream. Aquarius was also identified as the pourer of the waters which flooded the earth in the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], in the [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek version]] of the myth. As such, the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] was sometimes identified as being a river poured out by Aquarius.

It may also, together with the constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], be part of the origin of the myth of the [[Mares of Diomedes]], which forms one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Heracles]]. Its association with pouring out rivers, and the nearby constellation of [[Capricornus]], may be the source of the myth of the [[Augean stable]], which forms another of the labours.

===Astrology===
The Western [[astrological sign]] Aquarius of the [[tropical zodiac]] ([[January 20]] - [[February 18]]) differs from the astronomical constellation and the Hindu astrological sign of the [[Sidereal astrology|sidereal zodiac]] ([[February 16]] - [[March 11]]).

In some cosmologies, Aquarius is associated with the [[classical element]] [[air (classical element)|Air]], and thus called an Air Sign (with [[Libra]] and [[Gemini]]). It is also one of the four Fixed signs (along with [[Leo]], [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and [[Taurus]]). Its polar opposite is Leo. It is the domicile of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] (since its discovery [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] has been considered Aquarius' ruling or co-ruling planet by many modern astrologers). Each astrological sign is assigned a part of the body, viewed as the seat of its power. Aquarius rules the [[circulatory system]] as well as the [[ankles]]. The symbol for Aquarius is the [[water bearer]].

'''Anime''' („Ç¢„Éã„É°) is a style of [[animated cartoon|cartoon animation]] originating in [[Japan]]. Anime is characterized by character and background styles which may be created by hand or may be assisted by computers. Storylines may feature a variety of [[Fictional character|characters]] and may be set in different locations and in different eras. Anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences because there are a wide range of different [[genre]]s that any series may be categorised under. Anime may be broadcast on [[television]], distributed on media, such as [[DVD]]s, or published as [[console]] and [[computer]] [[games]]. Anime is often influenced by Japanese [[comics]] known as [[manga]]. Anime may also be adapted into [[live action]] television programs.

==History==
[[Image:Astroboy.png|right|thumb|Atom, star of the long-running science fiction series ''[[Astro Boy|Mighty Atom]]'' (also known as [[Astro Boy]] to Western audiences).]]
{{main|History of anime}}
The '''history of [[anime]]''' begins at the start of the 20th century, when [[Japan]]ese [[filmmaker]]s experimented with the [[animation]] techniques that were being explored in the West. During the 1970s, anime developed further, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing unique genres such as [[mecha]]. In the 1980s, anime was accepted in the [[mainstream]] in Japan, and experienced a [[boom]] in production. The 1990s and 2000s saw an increased acceptance of anime in overseas markets.

==Terminology==
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for animation is „Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥
(''animƒìshon'', pronounced: {{IPA|/…ënim…õÀê É…în/}}), written in [[katakana]]. It is a direct [[transliteration]] and reborrowed [[loanword]] of the English term &quot;[[animation]].&quot; The Japanese term is abbreviated as „Ç¢„Éã„É° (''anime'', pronounced: {{IPA|/…ënim…õ/}} ). Both the original and abbreviated forms are valid and interchangeable in Japanese, but as could be expected the abbreviated form is more commonly used. The term is a broad one, and does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style.

'''Pronunciation'''

The [[English language|English]] word ''anime'' is a [[transliteration]] of the abbreviated version of this Japanese term, and it is typically pronounced as {{IPA|/Àà√¶n…™Àåmei/}}, or &quot;ANN ih may&quot; (&quot;AH nee may&quot; is a less common variant). 

Some theorize the word comes from the [[French language|French]] ''anim√©'' (&quot;animated&quot;) or &quot;les dessins anim√©s&quot; (animated drawings) and pronounce it as &quot;ah nee MAY&quot;, though the Japanese themselves deny this theory, and the fact that it is written in Japanese syllables as „Ç¢„Éã„É° (''anime'') rather than „Ç¢„Éã„É°„Ç§ (''animei'') further lowers its credibility.

As with a few other Japanese words such as ''[[Pok√©mon]]'' and [[Kobo Abe|Kobo Ab√©]], ''anime'' is sometimes spelled as ''anim√©'' in English with an [[acute accent]] over the final ''e'' to cue the reader that the letter is pronounced as {{IPA|[e]}}. Hence, the pronunciations &quot;ah NEEM&quot; and &quot;uh NEEM&quot; are generally considered incorrect.

'''Syntax'''

''Anime'' can be used as a common [[noun]], ''&quot;Do you watch anime?&quot;'' or as a suppletive [[adjective]], ''&quot;The anime Guyver is different from the movie Guyver.&quot;'' It may also be used as a [[mass noun]], as in ''&quot;How much anime have you collected?&quot;'' and therefore is never pluralized &quot;animes&quot; (nouns are never pluralized in Japanese).

'''Synonyms'''

Anime is sometimes referred to by the [[blend (linguistics)|blend word]] '''Japanimation''', but this term has fallen into disuse. It saw the most usage during the 1970s and 1980s, which broadly comprise the first and second waves of anime [[fandom]]. The term survived at least into the early 1990s but seemed to fade away shortly before the mid-1990s anime resurgence. In general, the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts. The term is much more commonly used within Japan to refer to domestic animation. Since ''anime'' or ''animƒìshon'' is used to describe all forms of animation, ''Japanimation'' is used to distinguish Japanese work from that of the rest of the world.

In more recent years, anime has also frequently been referred to as ''manga'' in Europe, a practice that may stem from the Japanese usage: In Japan, ''[[manga]]'' can refer to both animation and comics (although the use of ''manga'' to refer to animation is mostly restricted to non-fans). Among English speakers, ''manga'' usually has the stricter meaning of &quot;Japanese comics&quot;. An alternate explanation is that it is due to the prominence of [[Manga Entertainment]], a distributor of anime to the US and UK markets; because Manga Entertainment started out in the UK, this use of the term is much more common in Europe.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Dragonballz.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Dragon Ball Z]] is one of the most popular [[sh≈çnen]] anime.]]

Anime features a wide variety of artistic styles which vary from artist to artist and is characterized by stark, colorful graphics and stylized, colorful images depicting vibrant characters in a variety of different settings and storylines, aimed at a wide range of audiences. 

===Genres===
Anime has many genres, with as many as traditional, [[live action]] cinema. Such genres include adventure, [[science fiction]], children's stories, [[Romantic love|romance]], medieval [[fantasy]], [[erotica]] ([[hentai]]), occult/horror, action, and [[drama]]. 

Most anime includes content from several different genres, as well as a variety of thematic elements. This can make categorizing some titles very difficult. A show may have a seemingly simple surface plot, but at the same time may feature a far more complex, deeper storyline and character development. It is not uncommon for a strongly action themed anime to also involve humor, romance, and even poignant [[social commentary]]. The same can be applied to a romance themed anime in that it may involve a strong action element.

Genres and designations that are specific to anime and manga:
:''(For other possible genres, see [[list of movie genres]].)''
*[[Bish≈çjo]]: Japanese for 'beautiful girl', blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty girl characters, for example ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]''
*[[Bish≈çnen]]: Japanese for 'beautiful boy' blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features &quot;pretty&quot; and elegant boys and men, for example ''[[Fushigi Y≈´gi]]''
*[[Ecchi]]: Japanese for 'indecent sexuality'. Contains mild sexual humor, for example ''[[Love Hina]]''.
*[[Hentai]]: Japanese for 'abnormal' or 'perverted', and used by Western Audiences to refer to pornographic anime or [[erotica]]. However, in Japan the term used to refer to the same material is typically ''Poruno'' or ''Ero''.
*[[Josei]]: Japanese for 'young woman', this is anime or manga that is aimed at young women, and is one of the rarest forms.
*[[Kodomo]]: Japanese for 'child', this is anime or manga that is aimed at young children, for example ''[[Doraemon]]''.
*[[Mecha]]: Anime or manga featuring giant robots, example ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''.
*[[Mo√©]]: Anime or manga featuring characters that are extremely perky or cute, for example ''[[Little Snow Fairy Sugar]]''.
*[[progressive anime|Progressive]]: &quot;Art films&quot; or extremely stylized anime, for example ''[[Voices of a Distant Star]]''.
*[[Seinen]]: Anime or manga similar to Sh≈çnen, but targeted at teenage or young male adults, for example ''[[Oh My Goddess!]]''.
*[[Super Sentai|Sentai/Super Sentai]]: Literally &quot;fighting team&quot; in Japanese, refers to any show that involves a superhero team, for example ''[[Cyborg 009]]''.
*[[Sh≈çjo]]: Japanese for 'young lady' or 'little girl', refers to anime or manga targeted at girls, for example ''[[Fruits Basket]]''.
**[[Magical girl|Mah≈ç Sh≈çjo]]: Subgenre of Shoujo known for 'Magical Girl' stories, for example ''[[Sailor Moon]]''.
*[[Sh≈çjo-ai]]: Japanese for 'girl-love', refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between female characters, for example ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]''.
*[[Sh≈çnen]]: Japanese for 'boys', refers to anime or manga targeted at boys, for example ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''.
*[[Sh≈çnen-ai]]: Japanese for 'boy-love', refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between male characters. This term is being phased out in Japan due to references to [[pedophilia]], and is being replaced by the term &quot;Boys Love&quot; (BL). An example of this style is ''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]''.

Some anime titles are written for a very specific audience, even narrower than those described above.  For example, ''[[Initial D]]'' and ''[[EX-Driver|√©X-Driver]]'' concern [[street racing]] and car tuning.  ''[[Ashita No Joe]]'' is about [[boxing]].  ''[[Hanaukyo Maid Team]]'' is based on the [[French maid]] fantasy.

Recently, the ''National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of Canada'' has incorrectly classified all anime as [[hentai]], giving an improper impression of the content of most anime and manga series. This occurred despite having linked to this Wikipedia page in order to establish a definition of terms. The site can be viewed at the following link: [http://ncecc.ca/fact_sheets/anime_e.htm]. Complaints about the article's content and improper citations caused the NCECC to revise the citations but not the content.

===Music===
Much like western live-action cinema, anime uses music as an important artistic tool. Anime soundtracks are big business in Japan, and are often times met with similar demand as [[chart-topper|chart topping]] pop albums. It is for this reason that anime music is often composed and performed by 'A-list' musicians, stars, and composers. Skilled BGM composers are highly respected in the anime fan community. Anime series with opening credits use the opening theme song as a quick introduction to the show. 

The most frequent use of music in Anime is ''background music'' or ''BGM''. BGM is used to set the tone of a given scene, for example ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' 's &quot;Decisive Battle&quot; is played when the characters are making battle preparations and it features heavy drum beats and a militaristic style which highlights the tension of the scene and hints at the action to follow. 

The theme song (also referred to as the Opening song or abbreviated as OP) usually matches the overall tone of the show, and serves to get the viewer excited about the upcoming program. Insert songs and ending songs (abbr. ED) often make commentary about the plot or the program as a whole, and are often times used to highlight a particularly important scene. Opening and ending themes, as well as insert songs, are frequently performed by popular musicians or Japanese [[japanese idol|idols]], so in this way, songs become a very important component of an anime program. In addition to the themes, the seiy≈´ for a specific anime also frequently releases CD for their character, called Image Albums. Despite the word &quot;image&quot; in the CD's name, it only contains music and/or &quot;voice messages&quot; (where the seiy≈´ talks with the audience or about herself), making the listener think that the character him/herself is singing. Another type of Anime CDs release are Drama CD, featuring songs and tracks which makes use of the seiy≈´ to tell a story, often not included in the main anime.

==Animation style==
[[Image:Lum-Uresei-Yatsura.png|thumb|250px|right|Lum from ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', an iconic anime character.]]

The drawing style used in anime is counter productive to the animation process, having far too many details and subsequently making it difficult to keep the number of drawings comparable to other cartoons with design ethics that stress simplicity. This may be due to a philosophy of applying more effort into each of a few drawings than less effort into one of many.

[[Osamu Tezuka]] adapted and simplified many [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production, though it should be noted that Disney films made in the west are not anime. This was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff. Anime studios have since perfected techniques to draw as little new animation as possible, using scrolling or repeating backgrounds, still shots of characters sliding across the screen, and dialogue which involves only animating mouths while the rest of the screen remains absolutely still, a technique not wholly unfamiliar to Western animation. The overall effect of these techniques, such as reduced [[frame rate]], several still shots and scrolling backgrounds, has led some critics to accuse anime of choppiness or poor quality in general. ''(See also [[limited animation]].)''

There are often scenes where the frame rate of the animation far exceeds the quality of the rest of the production. These are commonly referred to as &quot;money shots&quot; outside of Japan, where more effort is put into the animation of one scene to give it emphasis over the rest of the work. Animator [[Yasuo Otsuka]] was the pioneer of this technique.

Exceptions to these rules are early classic films, such as those produced by [[Toei Animation]] up until the mid 1960s, and recent big budget films, such as those produced by the enormously successful [[Studio Ghibli]]. These movies have much higher production values, due to their anticipated success at the box office. Some animators in Japan overcome production values by utilizing different techniques than the Disney or the old Tezuka/Otsuka methods of animating anime.  Directors such as [[Hiroyuki Imaishi]] (''[[Cutey Honey]]'', ''[[Dead Leaves]]'') simplify backgrounds so that more attention can be paid to character animation. Other animators like Tatsuyuki Tanaka (in [[Koji Minamoto]]'s ''Eternal Family'' in particular) use [[squash and stretch]], an animation technique not often used by Japanese animators; Tanaka makes other shortcuts to compensate for this. Some higher-budgeted television and OVA ([[Original Video Animation]]) series also forego the shortcuts found in most other anime.

While different titles and different artists have their own unique artistic styles, many stylistic elements have become extremely common. Some examples have become so common that they are often described as being definitive of anime in general, and have been given names of their own. The most common is the large eyes style drawn on many anime characters, common mainly due to the influence of [[Osamu Tezuka]], who was inspired by the exaggerated features of Western cartoon characters such as [[Betty Boop]] and [[Mickey Mouse]] and from Disney's ''[[Bambi]]''. Tezuka found that large eyes allowed his characters to better express their emotions. Some Western audiences have interpreted such stylized eyes as more Caucasian. Cultural anthropologist [[Matt Thorn]] argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive them as inherently more or less foreign. {{ref|refbot.15}} When Tezuka began drawing ''[[Princess Knight|Ribbon no Kishi]]'', the first manga specifically targeted at young girls, Tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters' eyes. Indeed, through ''Ribbon no Kishi'', Tezuka set a stylistic template that later ''sh≈çjo'' artists tended to follow. Another variation of this style is &quot;[[chibi]]&quot; or &quot;[[super deformed]]&quot;; which usually feature huge eyes, an enlarged head, and small body.

Other stylistic elements are common as well; often in comedic anime, characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a &quot;face fault&quot;, in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression. Angry characters may exhibit a &quot;vein&quot; or &quot;stressmark&quot; effect, where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead. Angry women will sometimes summon a mallet from nowhere and strike someone with it, leading to the concept of [[Hammerspace]]. Male characters will develop a [[bloody nose]] around their female love interests (typically to indicate arousal) -- this is supposedly due to blood rushing to the face in an exaggerated blush. Embarrassed characters will invariably produce a massive [[sweat-drop]], which has become something of a stereotype of anime.

The degree of stylization varies from title to title.  Some titles make extensive use of common stylization: ''[[FLCL]]'', for example, is known for its wild, exaggerated, stylization. In contrast, titles such as ''[[Only Yesterday]]'', a film by [[Isao Takahata]], take a much more realistic approach, and feature no stylistic exaggerations.

Another unique aspect of anime not found in other commercial animation markets is the lack of a directoral system. In most animation produced around the world animators are all forced to conform to a set style by the director or animation director. In Japan starting with the animation director [[Yoshinori Kanada]] (as a means to save time and money) each animator brings his/her own style to the work. The most extreme examples of this can be found in ''[[Mindgame]]'' or ''[[The Hakkenden]]''. ''The Hakkenden'' is particularly extreme, showing constantly shifting styles of animation based upon the key animator that worked on that particular episode.  This approach combined with Otsuka's &quot;money shots&quot; make key animators important individuals in the style and production of an anime film.

Many non-Japanese cartoons are starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols to appeal to anime's tremendously growing fanbase and cut costs.

==Production types of anime==
Most anime can be categorized as one of three types:

*'''Films''', which are generally released in theaters, represent the highest budgets and generally the highest video quality. Popular anime movies include ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]],'' ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', and ''[[Spirited Away]]''. Some anime [[film]]s are only released at film or animation festivals and are shorter and sometimes lower in production values. Some examples of these are ''[[Winter Days]]'', and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Legend of the Forest]]''. Other types of films include [[compilation movie]]s, which are television episodes edited together and presented in theaters for various reasons, and are hence a concentrated form of a television [[serial]]. These may, however, be longer than the average movie. There are also theatrical shorts derived from existing televisions series and billed in Japanese theaters together to form feature-length showing. 

*'''Television series''' anime is [[Television syndication|syndicated]] and broadcast on television on a regular schedule. [[Television program|Television series]] are generally low quality compared to OVA ([[Original Video Animation]]) and film titles, because the production budget is spread out over many episodes rather than a single film or a short series. Most episodes are about 23 minutes in length, to fill a typical thirty-minute time slot with added [[Television commercial|commercials]]. One full season is 26 episodes, and many titles run half seasons, or 13 episodes. Most TV series anime episodes will have [[opening credits]], [[closing credits]], and often an &quot;[[eyecatch]]&quot;, a very short scene, often humorous or silly, that is used to signal the start or end of the commercial break (as &quot;bumpers&quot; in the United States are used in a similar fashion). &quot;Eyecatch&quot; scenes are often found in TV series anime and are generally similar throughout the series.  

*'''OVA''' ('''[[Original Video Animation]]'''; sometimes  '''OAV''', or '''Original Animated Video''') anime is often similar to a television [[miniseries]]. OVAs are typically two to twenty episodes in length; [[one-shot]]s are particularly short, usually less than film-length. They are most commonly released directly to video. As a general rule OVA anime tends to be of high quality, approaching that of films.  Titles often have a very regular, continuous plot best enjoyed if all episodes are viewed in sequence. Popular OVA titles include ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'', and ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]''. Opening credits, closing credits, and eyecatches may sometimes be found in OVA releases, but not universally.

'''Franchising'''

It is very common for one title to spawn several different releases.  A title that starts as a popular television series might then have a movie produced at a later date. A good example is ''Tenchi Muyo!''. Originally an OVA, it spawned three movies, three television series, and several spinoff titles and specials.

Not all successors to an anime are a sequel to the original story. Prequels and alternate stories are commonly adapted from the original.

==Licensing and distribution==
Anime is available outside of Japan in localized form. Licensed anime is modified by [[Western world|Western]] distributors through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] into the language of the country. The anime may also be [[edited movie|edited]] to alter cultural references that may not be understood by a non-Japanese person and companies may remove what may be perceived as objectionable content. For the fans who may object to the editing and dubbing of anime, DVDs may be their preference. DVD releases often include both the dubbed audio and the original Japanese audio with [[subtitle]]s, are typically unedited, and lack [[Television commercial|commercial]]s.

'''Fansubs'''

Although it is a violation of [[copyright]] laws in many countries, some fans watch [[fansub]]s, recordings of anime series that have been subtitled by fans. Watching subtitled Japanese versions is usually seen as the intended method of watching anime by enthusiasts. The ethical implications of producing, distributing, or watching fansubs is a topic of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from and cease distribution of their work once the series has been licensed.

'''Ankara''' is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Turkey]] and the country's second largest city after [[ƒ∞stanbul]]. The city has a population of 4,319,167 (Provience 5,153,000) ([[as of 2005]]), and a mean elevation of 850 m. (2800 ft.) It was formerly known as '''[[Angora]]''' or '''Eng√ºr√º''', and in Roman times as '''Ancyra''', and in classical and Hellenistic periods as ·ºåŒ≥Œ∫œÖœÅŒ± '''√Å≈ãkyra'''.

It is also the capital of [[Ankara Province]].

Centrally located in [[Anatolia]], Ankara is an important commercial and industrial city. It is the center of the Turkish Government, and houses all foreign embassies. It is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the center of Turkey's highway and rail network, and serves as the marketing center for the surrounding agricultural area. The city was famous for its long-haired goat and its wool ([[Angora wool]]), a unique breed of cat ([[Turkish Angora|Ankara cat]]), white [[rabbits]], [[pear]], [[honey]], and the region's [[Muscat grape|muscat]] [[grapes]].

Ankara is situated upon a steep and rocky hill, which rises 500 ft. above the plain on the left bank of the ''Enguri Su'', a tributary of the [[Sakarya]] (Sangarius) river. The city is located 39&amp;deg;52'30&quot; North, 32&amp;deg;52' East (39.875, 32.8333). The city, which is one of the driest places in Turkey and surrounded by a barren featureless steppe vegetation, with various [[Hittite]], [[Phrygian]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[archeological site]]s. It has a harsh dry [[continental climate]] with cold snowy winters and hot dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during spring and autumn. 

The hill is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which add to the picturesqueness of the view; but the town was not well built, many of its houses constructed of sun-dried mud bricks along narrow streets. &lt;sup&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html]&lt;/sup&gt;  There are, however, many finely preserved remains of [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], the most remarkable being the temple of [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], on the walls of which is the famous ''Monumentum Ancyranum''&lt;sup&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:A Turkish Kaleidoscope (1926)- Ankara Bazaar.png|left|thumb|300px|Ankara Bazaar in [[1920s]].]]
The region's vibrant history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hatti]] civilization, which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites|Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygians]], then by the [[Lydians]] and [[Persia|Persians]]. 

Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of the Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great]]. In [[333 BC]], Alexander came from [[Gordium]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a period of time. After his death at [[Babylon]] in [[323 BC]] and the subsequent division of his empire amongst his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]]. 

In [[278 BC]], Ankara was occupied by the [[Gaul|Gaulish]] race of [[Galatia|Galatians]] who were the first to make Ankara their capital. It was then known as '''Ancyra''', meaning &quot;[[anchor]]&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Ankara's organized and written history starts with the [[Galatia|Galatians]].

[[Image:Ulus_Ankara.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A view from Ulus, the historical district of Ankara.]]
The city subsequently fell to the [[Roman Empire]] in [[189 BC]] and became the capital of the Roman province of [[Galatia]]. Under Roman rule, Ankara became a gate to the east for Rome, and as such was well developed, achieving the status of &quot;city-state&quot; or [[polis]]. The city's military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] reign, even after its capital was moved to [[Constantinople]]. Although Ankara fell into the hands of several Arab armies numerous times after the 6th century, it remained an important crossroads polis within the Byzantine Empire until the late 11th century.

In [[1071]] [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan|Alparslan]] threw open the door to Anatolia for the Turks by his victory at [[Battle of Manzikert|Malazgirt]]. He then annexed Ankara, an important location for military transportation and natural resources, to Turkish territory in [[1073]]. [[Orhan I]], second &quot;bey&quot; of the [[Ottoman Empire]] captured the city in [[1356]]. Another [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] leader, [[Timur Lenk]] besieged Ankara as part of his campaign in [[Anatolia]], but in [[1403]] Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

At the close of [[World War I]], Turkey was under the control of the Ottoman sultan and having lost the war, was being shared by [[Greece|Greeks]], [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Italy|Italians]]. The leader of the Turkish nationalists, [[Kemal Atat√ºrk]] established the headquarters of his resistance movement in Ankara in [[1919]] (See [[Treaty of S√®vres]] and [[Turkish War of Independence]]). After the War of Independence was won and the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, Turkey was declared a [[republic]] on [[October 29]], [[1923]], Ankara having replaced [[ƒ∞stanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]) as the capital of the new [[Republic of Turkey]] on [[October 13]], [[1923]].

[[Image:Kizilay_Ankara.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A recent view from Kƒ±zƒ±lay, the central district of Ankara.]]
After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called '''Ulus''', and a new section, called '''Yeni≈üehir'''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered around '''Kƒ±zƒ±lay''', has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section.

The Byzantines and Seljuks further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine, music and of course, [[Raki]].

It is important for the &quot;Monument Ancyranum&quot;, the sole surviving political testament of Augustus, detailing his achievements inscribed on its walls in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. In the fifth century the temple was converted into a church by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. The temple is in the Ulus quarter of the city.

'''Arabic''' ({{ar|ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©}};  ''{{ArabDIN|al-luƒ°atu-l- ªarabiyyatu}}'', less formally, {{ar|ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä}}  ''{{ArabDIN| ªarabƒ´}}'') is the largest member of the [[Semitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] (classification: South Central Semitic) and is closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. It is spoken throughout the [[Arab world]] and is widely studied and known throughout the [[Islamic world]]. Arabic has been a [[literary language]] since at least the [[6th century]] and is the [[liturgical language]] of [[Islam]].

Quite a few [[English language|English]] words are ultimately derived from Arabic, often through other [[Europe]]an languages, especially [[Spanish language|Spanish]], among them every-day vocabulary like &quot;[[sugar]]&quot; (''sukkar''),  &quot;[[cotton]]&quot; (''{{unicode|qu·π≠≈´n}}'')  or &quot;[[magazine]]&quot; (''[[makhzen|{{ArabDIN|ma·∏´ƒÅzin}}]]''). More recognizable are words like &quot;[[algebra]]&quot;, &quot;[[alcohol]]&quot; and &quot;zenith&quot; (see [[list of English words of Arabic origin]]).

==Literary and Modern Standard Arabic==
The term &quot;Arabic&quot; may refer either to [[literary Arabic]] or [[Modern Standard Arabic]] or to the many localized [[varieties of Arabic]] commonly called &quot;colloquial Arabic.&quot; Arabs consider literary Arabic as the standard language and tend to view everything else as mere dialects. [[Literary Arabic]], ''{{ArabDIN|al-luƒ°atu-l- ªarabiyyatu-l-fu·π£·∏•ƒÅ}}'' (Literally: &quot;the most eloquent Arabic language&quot; &amp;mdash; {{ar|ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÅÿµÿ≠Ÿâ}}) refers both to the language of present-day media across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] and to the more articulate language of the [[Qur'an]]. (The expression ''media'' here includes most television and radio, and all written matter, including all books, newspapers, magazines, documents of every kind, and reading primers for small children.) &quot;Colloquial&quot; or &quot;dialectal&quot; Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties derived from Classical Arabic, spoken daily across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], which constitute the everyday spoken language. These sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible. These dialects are not typically written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry) exists in many of them. They are often used to varying degrees in informal spoken media, such as [[soap opera]]s and [[talk show]]s.
Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages.

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]‚Äìthe normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school-taught literary Arabic (to an equal or lesser degree). This diglossic situation facilitates [[code switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth unaware between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence.  In instances in which Arabs of different nationalities engage in conversation only to find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), both should be able to code switch into Literary Arabic for the sake of communication.  

Since the written Arabic of today differs from the written Arabic of the [[Qur'an]]ic era, it has become customary in western scholarship and among non-Arab scholars of Arabic to refer to the language of the Qur'an as [[Classical Arabic]] and the modern language of the media and of formal speech as [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Arabs, on the other hand, often use the term ''{{Unicode|fu·π£·∏•ƒÅ}}'' to refer to both forms, thus placing greater emphasis on the similarities between the two. The difference between Arabic of the Qur'anic era and today's Classical Arabic is only in the degree of eloquence. The vocabulary, the syntactic and grammatical rules are the same.

==Arabic and Islam==
It is sometimes difficult to translate [[Islam]]ic concepts, and concepts specific to [[Arab culture]], without using the original Arabic terminology. The [[Qur'an]] is expressed in Arabic and traditionally [[Muslim]]s deem it impossible to translate in a way that would adequately reflect its exact meaning&amp;mdash;indeed, until recently, some schools of thought maintained that it should not be translated at all. A [[list of Islamic terms in Arabic]] covers those terms which are too specific to translate in one phrase. While Arabic is strongly associated with [[Islam]] (and is the language of [[salah]]), it is also spoken by [[Arab Christians]], Oriental {{Unicode|([[Mizrahi Jews|Mizra·∏•i]])}} [[Jew]]s, and smaller sects such as Iraqi [[Mandaean]]s. Even so, a majority of the world's [[Muslims]] do not actually speak Arabic, but only know some fixed phrases of the language, such as those used in Islamic prayer. However, to counteract this trend, non-Arabic-speaking Muslims are strongly encouraged to learn the language.

==Classification and related languages==
[[Maltese language|Maltese]], which is spoken on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]], is the only surviving European language to derive primarily from Arabic, though it contains a large number of [[Italian language|Italian]] and English borrowings.

==Dialects==
''See [[varieties of Arabic]] for main article''

&quot;Colloquial Arabic&quot; is a collective term for the spoken languages or dialects of people throughout the Arab world, which, as mentioned, differ radically from the [[literary language]]. The main dialectal division is between the [[Maghreb]] dialects and those of the [[Middle East]], followed by that between sedentary dialects and the much more conservative [[Bedouin]] dialects.  [[Maltese language|Maltese]], though descended from Arabic, is considered a separate language. Speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of Arabic; in particular, while Middle Easterners can generally understand one another, they often have trouble understanding Maghrebis (although the converse is not true, due to the popularity of Middle Eastern&amp;mdash;especially Egyptian&amp;mdash;films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words, and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among [[Romance languages]], retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fiih'', and North African ''kayen'' all mean &quot;there is&quot;, and all come from Arabic (''yakuun'', ''fiihi'', ''kaa'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

The major groups are:

*[[Egyptian Arabic]]
*[[Maghreb Arabic]] ([[Algerian Arabic]], [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Tunisian Arabic]] and western Libyan)
*[[Levantine Arabic]] (Western Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and western Jordanian, [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]])
*[[Iraqi Arabic]] ([[Khuzestani Arabic]]), which has significant [[Persian language|Persian]] influence and is not understood by most other Arabic speakers
*[[Gulf Arabic]]   (Eastern Syrian, Kuwaiti, Saudi Arabian, Persian Gulf coast from Iraq to Oman including much of Saudi Arabia's [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], and minorities on the other side)

Other varieties include:

* {{unicode|[[Hassaniya|·∏§assƒÅnƒ´ya]]}} (in Mauritania and western Sahara)
* [[Andalusi Arabic]] (extinct, but important role in literary history)
* [[Maltese language|Maltese]]
* [[Sudanese Arabic]] (with a dialect continuum into Chad)
* [[Baharna Arabic]] (Bahrain, Saudi Eastern Province, and Oman)
* [[Hijazi Arabic]] (west coast of Saudi Arabia, Northern Saudi Arabia, eastern Jordan, Western Iraq)
* [[Najdi Arabic]] (Najd region of central Saudi Arabia)
* [[Yemeni Arabic]] (Yemen to southern Saudi Arabia)

{{IPA notice}}
The phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Standard Arabic.

===Vowels===

Arabic has three vowels, with their long forms, plus two diphthongs: ''a'' {{IPA|[…õÃà]}} (open ''e'' as in English ''bed'', but centralised), ''i'' {{IPA|[…™]}}, ''u'' {{IPA|[ ä]}}; ''ƒÅ'' {{IPA|[√¶Àê]}}, ''ƒ´'' {{IPA|[iÀê]}}, ''≈´'' {{IPA|[uÀê]}}; ''ai'' (''ay'') {{IPA|[…õÃà…™]}}, ''au'' (''aw'') {{IPA|[…õÃà ä]}}. [[Allophone|Allophonically]], after velarized consonants (see following), the vowel ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[…ë]}}, ''ƒÅ'' as {{IPA|[…ëÀê]}} (thus also after ''r''), ''ai'' as {{IPA|[…ë…™]}} and ''au'' as {{IPA|[…ë ä]}}.

See [[Arabic alphabet]] for explanations on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic symbols found in this chart.

# {{IPA|[d í]}} is pronounced as {{IPA|[…°]}} by some speakers. This is especially characteristic of the Egyptian and southern Yemeni dialects. In many parts of North Africa and in the Levant, it is pronounced as {{IPA|[ í]}}.
# {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[lÀÅ]}} only in {{IPA|/ îalÀÅÀê…ëÀêh/}}, the name of God, i.e. [[Allah]], when the word follows ''a'', ''ƒÅ'', ''u'' or ''≈´'' (after ''i'' or ''ƒ´'' it is unvelarised: ''bismi l-lƒÅh'' {{IPA|/b…™sm…™lÀê√¶Àêh/}}).
# {{IPA|/ ï/}} is usually a phonetic [[approximant]].
# In many varieties (if not most), {{IPA|/ƒß,  ï/}} are actually [[epiglottal]] {{IPA|[ ú,  ¢]}} (despite what is reported in many earlier works).

The consonants traditionally termed &quot;emphatic&quot; {{IPA|/tÀÅ, dÀÅ, sÀÅ, √∞ÀÅ/}} are either [[velarization|velarised]] {{IPA|[tÀ†, dÀ†, sÀ†, √∞À†]}} or [[pharyngealization|pharyngealised]] {{IPA|[tÀÅ, dÀÅ, sÀÅ, √∞ÀÅ]}}.  In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter e.g. {{IPA|/dÀÅ/}}  is written ‚ÄπD‚Ä∫; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it e.g. ‚Äπ·∏ç‚Ä∫.

Vowels and consonants can be (phonologically) short or long.  Long (geminate) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the Arabic diacritic mark [[shaddah]], which marks lengthened consonants.  Such consonants are held twice as long as short consonants.  This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: e.g.  ''qabala'' &quot;he received&quot; and  ''qabbala'' &quot;he kissed&quot;.

===Syllable structure===
Arabic has two kinds of syllable: open syllables (CV) and (CVV) - and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC).  Every syllable begins with a consonant - or else a consonant is borrowed from a previous word through elision ‚Äì especially in the case of the definite article THE, ''al'' (used when starting an utterance) or ''_l'' (when following a word), e.g. ''baytu ‚Äìl mudiir'' ‚Äúhouse (of) the director‚Äù, which becomes ''bay-tul-mu-diir'' when divided syllabically.  By itself, definite ''mudiir'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/al mudiÀêr/}}.

===Stress===
Although word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic, it does bear a strong relationship to vowel length and syllable shape, and correct word stress aids intelligibility.  In general, &quot;heavy&quot; syllables attract stress (i.e. syllables of longer duration - a closed syllable or a syllable with a long vowel).  In a word with a syllable with one long vowel, the long vowel attracts the stress (e.g. ''ki-'taab'' and ''  ‚Äòkaa-tib'').  In a word with two long vowels, the second long vowel attracts stress (e.g.''ma-kaa-'tiib''). In a word with a &quot;heavy&quot; syllable where two consonants occur together or the same consonant is doubled, the (last) heavy syllable attracts stress (e.g. ''ya-ma-‚Äôniyy'', ''ka-'tabt'', ''ka-‚Äòtab-na'', ma-‚Äòjal-lah,'' ‚Äòmad-ra-sah'', ''yur-‚Äòsil-na'').  This last rule trumps the first two: ''ja-zaa-{{unicode| î}}i-‚Äòriyy''.  Otherwise, word stress typically falls on the first syllable: '' ‚Äòya-man'', ''  ‚Äòka-ta-bat'', etc.  The Cairo ([[Egyptian Arabic]]) dialect, however, has some idiosyncrasies in that a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, so that ''mad-‚Äòra-sah'' carries the stress on the second-to-last syllable, as does ''qaa-‚Äòhi-rah''.

===Dialectal variations===
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above.  For example, non-Arabic {{IPA|[v]}} is used in the Maghreb dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names.  Semitic {{IPA|[p]}} became {{IPA|[f]}} extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]]) distinguish between {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}.  Interdental fricatives ({{IPA|[Œ∏]}} and {{IPA|[√∞]}}) are rendered as stops {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} in some dialects (principally Levantine and Egyptian) and as {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language.  Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes {{IPA|[dÀÅ]}} and {{IPA|[√∞ÀÅ]}} coallesced into a single phoneme, becoming one or the other.  Predictably, dialects without interdental fricatives use {{IPA|[dÀÅ]}} exclusively, while those with such fricatives use {{IPA|[√∞ÀÅ]}}.  Again, in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language, {{IPA|[√∞ÀÅ]}} is rendered as {{IPA|[zÀÅ]}} in dialects without interdental fricatives.  Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render Standard {{IPA|[q]}} (a voiceless uvular stop): it retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as Yemen and Morocco (and among the [[Druze]]), while it is rendered {{IPA|[…°]}} in Gulf Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Upper Egypt and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g. Jordan) and as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ î]}} in many prestige dialects, such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus.  Thus, Arabs instantly give away their geographical (and class) origin by their pronunciation of a word such as ''qamar'' &quot;moon&quot;:  {{IPA|[qamar]}}, {{IPA|[…°amar]}} or {{IPA|[ îamar]}}.

== Grammar ==
''See [[Arabic grammar]]''


== Writing system ==
''Main article: [[Arabic alphabet]]''

The Arabic alphabet derives from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] script (which variety - [[Nabataean]] or [[Syriac]] - is a matter of scholarly dispute), to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] or [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] to [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]]. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (Maghrebi) and Eastern version of the alphabet&amp;mdash;in particular, the ''fa'' and ''qaf'' had a dot underneath and a single dot above respectively in the [[Maghreb]], and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals). However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools ([[zaouia]]s) of West Africa. Arabic, like other [[Semitic]] languages, is written from right to left.

===Calligraphy===

''See [[Arabic calligraphy]] for a fuller overview.''

After the definitive fixing of the Arabic script around [[786]], by [[Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi]], many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Qur'an and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Kufi.png|Kufic font]] --&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as in the Western world, and is still considered by Arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the [[Latin alphabet]], Arabic script is used to write down a [[ayah|verse]] of the Qur'an, a [[Hadith]], or simply a [[proverb]], in a spectacular composition. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. Two of the current masters of the genre are [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [http://arabworld.nitle.org/gallery.php?module_id=7 Khaled Al Saa‚Äôi].

===Transliteration===

''See [[Arabic transliteration]] and [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]] for more information.''

There are a number of different standards of [[Arabic transliteration]]: methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the [[Latin alphabet]]. The more scientific standards allow the reader to recreate the exact word using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. However, these systems are heavily reliant on [[diacritic]]al marks such as &quot;≈°&quot; for the English ''sh'' sound.  At first sight, this may be difficult to recognize.  Less scientific, systems often use [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (like ''sh'' and ''kh''), which are usually more simple to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems.  In some cases, the ''sh'' or ''kh'' sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them -- that way, they can be distinguished from separate ''s'' and ''h'' sounds or ''k'' and ''h'' sounds, respectively.  (Compare ''gashouse'' to ''gash''.)

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the [[Arab world]], such as [[personal computers]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[Bulletin board system]]s, [[IRC]], [[instant messaging]] and [[mobile phone text messaging]]. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the [[Latin alphabet]] only, and some of them still do not have the [[Arabic alphabet]] as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometime known as [[IM_Arabic]].

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral &quot;3&quot; may be used to represent the Arabic letter &quot;ÿπ&quot;, ''ayn''. There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]].  Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the &quot;emphatic&quot; counterparts of certain consonants.  For instance, using capitalization, the letter &quot;ÿØ&quot;, or ''daal'', may be represented by '''d'''.  Its emphatic counterpart, &quot;ÿ∂&quot;, may be written as '''D'''.

'''''Apocalypse Now''''' is a [[1979 in film|1979]] [[United States|American]] [[film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] from a script by [[John Milius]] (rewritten by Coppola) which was inspired by [[Joseph Conrad]]'s classic [[novella]] ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. Set during the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of a taciturn American soldier who is sent to &quot;terminate with extreme prejudice&quot; the command of a rogue [[United States Army Special Forces]] [[colonel]]. The narrative of his journey and its culmination are studded with events which, while bizarre, are based on real Vietnam stories. The soldier's journey becomes increasingly nonlinear and hallucinatory. Coppola's agenda clearly involves larger themes; the film's subtext concerns a journey into the darkness of the human [[psyche]].

The film features performances by [[Martin Sheen]] as Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Marlow in Conrad's novel), [[Marlon Brando]] as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, [[Dennis Hopper]] as a fast-talking [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]-using photojournalist, and [[Robert Duvall]] in an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated turn as the borderline-[[psychosis|psychotic]] [[Lt. Colonel]] Kilgore. Several other actors who were (or later became) prominent stars had minor or supporting roles in the movie including [[Harrison Ford]], [[R. Lee Ermey]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]] (who, only fourteen years old when shooting began in March 1976, was credited as 'Larry Fishburne').

The movie poster art for ''Apocalypse Now'' is one of the more famous paintings by [[Bob Peak]], who is considered an influential artist in the world of film when it comes to [[movie poster]]s.

==Background==
Filmed in the [[Philippines]] (most notably the [[Pagsanjan River]] and [[Hidden Valley Springs]]), the film went far over budget and schedule: a [[typhoon]] destroyed many of the sets, the Philippine Air Force helicopters used for shooting were constantly called back by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to be used in actual combat, the lead role was recast (Martin Sheen replaced [[Harvey Keitel]] after shooting had begun), Sheen then had a near-fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], Brando was intractable and out of shape, and Coppola himself was mentally fragile. Being similar in appearance and remarkably similar in voice, Martin Sheen's brother [[Joe Estevez]] [[Stand-in|stood in]] for the unwell Sheen in much of the film and some of the narration is by him.

After the first edit, the film was six hours long and had to be severely edited; the original released version was just over two and a half hours long. (Coppola re-released the film in [[2001]] under the title ''Apocalypse Now Redux'', restoring footage and sequences and lifting the running time to 200 minutes. Recent rumors have persisted that Coppola is considering releasing the true original cut on DVD, but there has been no fruition or conformation of this.)  For background information on the film, see [[Eleanor Coppola]]'s documentary, ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'', released in [[1991]].

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

U.S. Army Captain Benjamin L. Willard is stationed in [[Saigon]]; a seasoned veteran, he is deeply troubled and apparently no longer fit for civilian life. A group of [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] officers approach him with a special mission up-river into the remote [[Cambodia|Cambodian]] jungle to find Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a former member of the [[United States Army Special Forces]]. 

They state that Kurtz, once considered a model officer and future [[general]], has apparently gone [[insane]] and is commanding a legion of his own [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops deep in [[Neutral country|neutral]] Cambodia. Their claims are supported by very disturbing radio broadcasts and/or recordings made by Kurtz himself. Willard is asked to undertake a mission to find Kurtz and dispose of him &quot;with extreme prejudice.&quot; 

Willard studies the intelligence files during the boat ride to the river entrance and learns that Kurtz, isolated in his compound, has assumed the role of a warlord and is worshipped by the natives and his own loyal men. Another officer, sent earlier to kill Kurtz, has apparently become one of his lieutenants.

Willard will begin his trip up the [[Mekong River]] on a PBR ([[Patrol boat, rigid|Patrol Boat, River]]), with an eclectic crew composed of by-the-book and formal [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief]] Phillips, a black Navy boat commander; [[Petty Officer Third Class|GM3]] Lance B. Johnson, a tanned all-American [[California]] surfer; [[Petty Officer Third Class|GM3]] Tyrone, AKA &quot;Clean&quot;, a black 17-year-old from [[The Bronx]]; and the [[Cajun]] Engineman, Jay &quot;Chef&quot; Hicks. 

[[Image:Apocalype Now Huey.jpg|thumbnail|The village attack scene in ''Apocalypse Now''.]]

The PBR arrives at a [[Landing Zone]] where Willard and the crew meet up with [[Lt. Colonel]] [[Bill Kilgore]], the merciless commander of the [[air cavalry|AirCav]] in the region, following a massive and hectic mopping-up operation of a conquered enemy town. Kilgore, a keen surfer, befriends Johnson. Later, he learns from one of his men that the beach down the coast which marks the opening to the river is perfect for [[surfing]], a factor which persuades him to capture it. The problem is, his troops say, it's &quot;[[Viet Cong|Charlie]]'s point&quot; and heavily fortified. Dismissing this complaint with the explanation that &quot;Charlie don't surf!&quot;, Kilgore orders his men to saddle up in the morning so that the AirCav can capture the town and the beach. Riding high above the coast in a fleet of [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]]s accompanied by [[Hughes H-6|H-6]]s, Kilgore launches an attack on the beach. The scene, famous for its use of [[Richard Wagner]]'s epic &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot;, ends with the soldiers surfing the barely claimed beach amidst skirmishes between infantry and VC.  After helicopters swoop over the village and demolish all visible signs of resistance, a giant [[napalm]] strike in the nearby jungle dramatically marks the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the battle.  &quot;I love the smell of [[napalm]] in the morning; smells like...victory,&quot; Kilgore exults to Willard.  The quote made it to #12 onto the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]], a list of top movie quotes.

[[Image:Apocalypse_Now_Smell_Like_Victory.jpg|thumbnail|&quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning...It smells like...victory.&quot;]]

The lighting and mood darken as the boat navigates upstream and Willard's silent obsession with Kurtz deepens.  Episodes on the journey include a run-in with a [[tiger]] while Willard and Chef search for [[mango]] fruits, an impromptu inspection of a Vietnamese [[sampan]] that leads to massacre, a surreal stop at the last American outpost during a Vietnamese attack against a wood bridge under construction there, and the shocking deaths of both &quot;Clean&quot; and Chief Phillips during a gunfire ambush with hidden Viet Cong soldiers and a spear thrown by a native on the shore, respectively.

Once arrived at Kurtz's compound, Willard leaves Chef behind with orders to call in an [[air strike]] on the village if he does not return. They are met by a borderline-psychotic freelance photographer (Hopper) who explains Kurtz's greatness and [[philosophy|philosophic]] skills to provoke his people into following him. Brought before Kurtz and held in captivity in a darkened temple, Willard‚Äôs constitution appears to weaken as Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, [[humanity]], and [[civilization]]. Kurtz explains his motives and philisophy in a famous and haunting monolgue: 

'' I've seen horrors... horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror. Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate the children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. 

''And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought: My God... the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters. These were men... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment.'' '''Because it's judgment that defeats us'''.''

While bound outside in the pouring rain, Willard is approached by Kurtz, who places the severed head of Chef in his lap. Coppola makes little explicit, but we come to believe that Willard and Kurtz develop an understanding nonetheless; Kurtz wishes to die at Willard's hands, and Willard, having subsequently granted Kurtz his wish, is offered the chance to succeed him in his warlord-[[demigod]] role. Juxtaposed with a ceremonial slaughtering of a [[water buffalo]], Willard enters Kurtz's chamber during one of his message recordings, and kills him with a machete (This entire sequence is set to [[The End (The Doors song)|The End]] by [[The Doors]]). Lying bloody and dying on the ground, Kurtz whispers &quot;The horror...the horror.&quot; (This line is taken directly from Conrad's novella.) Willard walks through the now-silent crowd of natives until he comes upon Lance, who seems to have integrated himself into the society. The two of them make their way to the PBR and float away as Kurtz's final words echo in the wind as the screen fades to black. 

===''Redux''===
In 2001 Coppola released ''Apocalypse Now: Redux'', which restored 49 minutes of scenes that were cut from the original film, including stopovers at a [[French people|French]] [[rubber]] plantation wherein Mr. Clean is buried and a rain-soaked American base camp.  Nudity absent from the original was also included in the Redux, most notably at the French plantation and in an additional scene with the Playboy playmates (from the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show.)

In this version, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard, which can still be seen briefly onboard the PBR in the original cut.

===Alternate Endings===
Coppola denied having any actual alternative endings. In the [[DVD]] commentary, he states that they simply had a massive amount of footage to edit with and thus had some choices to make. They did consider using the explosion footage made during their destruction of the Kurtz compound, but he later decided that implying that the air strike had been called in was contrary to his wish to offer some slight hope that we could overcome the horrors of [[war]].

However, there are multiple slightly varying versions of the ending credits.

One version, from the 70mm release, ends with no credits, and shows the boat pulling away. Another version, for the 35mm wide release, rolls the credits while the Kurtz compound is destroyed in what must be assumed was an air strike. Yet another version ends silently, without the explosions, and the credits roll over a black background.

==Themes==
''Apocalypse Now'' is a thematically rich film. The primary motif of the film is that of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', i.e. an odyssey into the darkness of humanity. 

Willard's constant narration gives us a glimpse into his fractured psychological state particularly in the opening scenes where he lies in his bed and stares blankly into the ceiling. He relates that he is on his second tour of duty and that he returned because he was unable to re-integrate himself into civilian life. 

:''Saigon... shit; I'm still only in Saigon... Every time I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said &quot;yes&quot; to a divorce. When I was here, I wanted to be there; when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now... waiting for a mission... getting softer; every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.''

This chilling monologue besides suggesting how man is connected to war is also an allusion to [[post traumatic stress disorder]], a condition common to many Vietnam veterans. Willard's quest for Kurtz's compound parallels Kurtz's own descent into madness. He never tells his fellow shipmates of the PBR the true purpose of the mission and in a chilling scene, after his crew massacres people sailing on a sampan, Willard murders the surviving girl. Kurtz who was a committed family man and a highly respected colonel is driven insane after witnessing a vile incident commited by his enemies while on a peacekeeping mission. He realised that he can never win the war unless he surrenders his morality and kill without judgment. For Kurtz, this action drove him insane and so he gathered other disillusioned soldiers and started a strange, bizarre civilization in the Cambodian forest.

This is a subtle allusion to the bureaucracy that directs soldiers in the war. The bureaucrats propagandized the [[Vietnam War]] as a just cause to save the world from the evil of [[Communism]].

The general public and several Vietnam war veterans fiercely condemned the war and believed that the government lied and misled the public. 

Even Willard who is assigned the mission is cynical about his mission from the beginning :
: ''Charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500''

{{spoiler}}

The climax at Kurtz's compound is the most confusing and the most frequently debated aspect of the film. Several critics believe it to be anticlimactic after the earlier more action oriented scenes and also the fact that it differs greatly from other war films in that there's no final battle scenario. 

[[Roger Ebert]] in his original review defends the ending:

:''Coppola doesn't have an ending, if we or he expected the closing scenes to pull everything together and make sense of it. Nobody should have been surprised. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; doesn't tell any kind of a conventional story, doesn't have a thought-out message for us about Vietnam, has no answers, and thus needs no ending.The way the film ends now, with Brando's fuzzy, brooding monologues and the final violence, feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could.''

When Willard arrives, he is captured and put into containment as he is 'interrogated' by Kurtz who lectures and drones on about his philosophies. While other interpretations exist, it can be assumed that Kurtz wishes to die a soldier's death and has been waiting for his death. But his followers refuse to kill him and Colby([[Scott Glenn]]) who was sent to kill him ended up joining his 'tribe'. He wishes or rather hopes that Willard would be able to do so. Willard, at first does not want to as he too is converted by Kurtz's beliefs but after Kurtz's monologue and his statement on judgment, Willard understands Kurtz's desire and so decides to complete his mission by subverting his moral judgment and justifies it to himself

:''Everybody wanted me to do it, him most of all. I felt like he was up there, waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to go out like a soldier, standing up, not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead, and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.''

The 'jungle' is seen as a metaphor to nature or more specifically man's human nature. After killing Kurtz, Willard is revered by the denizens of Kurtz's tribe but he instead leaves suggesting that perhaps he is capable of escaping the horror of war.

==Responses==
''Apocalypse Now'' premiered in [[1979]] to mixed reviews and received polarized responses from the audiences. It is said that it was as lauded as it was reviled. Many critics slammed the film, calling it overly pretentious, while others felt that it ended anticlimatically after a splendid first act.

[[Roger Ebert]], who hailed it as the best film of [[1979]] and added it to his list of Great Movies stated:
:&quot;Apocalypse Now is the best Vietnam film, one of the greatest of all films, because it pushes beyond the others, into the dark places of the soul. It is not about war so much as about how war reveals truths we would be happy never to discover.&quot;

Today, the film is regarded by many as a masterpiece of the [[New Hollywood]] era. It is on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list at number 28. Kilgore's quote &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot; was number 12 on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]] list. ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine polled several critics to name the best film of the last 25 years and ''Apocalypse Now'' was named number 1.

The catastrophic production of the film unfortunately made it symbol of the dangers of excessive directorial control over a film. The production was said to have taken a toll on Coppola, both mentally and emotionally. To many cinephiles, ''Apocalypse Now'' is the last great film of a legendary director whose subsequent films have failed to match it in quality.

==Adaptation==
Although inspired by Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'', the film deviates extensively from it. The novel takes place in the [[Belgian Congo]] in the [[19th century]]; Kurtz and Marlow (who is named Willard in the movie) are commercial agents of a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[ivory]] company that brutally exploits its [[Africa|African]] native workers. In the novel, Marlow is sent to bring the ailing Kurtz home; in the movie, Willard is sent to kill Kurtz.

The character of Kilgore is an invention of the screenwriters. Nevertheless, Coppola has maintained many episodes (the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example) that respect the spirit of the novel and in particular its critique of the concept of civilization and progress. The fact that Coppola substituted [[Europe|European]] colonization with [[United States|American]] [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] does not change the universal message of the book.

==Influence==
As one of the most [[icon]]ic films of the [[1900s|20th century]], the film has been referenced and [[parody|parodied]] countless times.

===Film===
* The film was parodied in a short film called ''[[Porklips Now]]'', about health inspector Will Dullard, who makes a trip to inspect the meat processing shop of a man named Mertz.
* British film ''[[Nil by Mouth (film)|Nil by Mouth]]'', by ''[[Gary Oldman]]'', has a scene where the character Danny (played by ''[[Steve Sweeney]]'') dubs the scene that the photojournalist talks to Cap. Willard (when he is in the wood cage), as the film is played on a TV.
* In ''[[True Romance]]'', [[Clarence Worley]] calls ''Apocalypse Now'' &quot;the greatest Vietnam film ever made&quot;.
* ''[[Apocalypse Pooh]]'' is a nine-minute short which marries visuals from ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' cartoons with audio from ''Apocalypse Now''.  Amazingly, they fit perfectly, following the basic [[plot]] well.
* ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'' starring Sheen's son [[Charlie Sheen]] parodies the film. Martin Sheen, appearing once again as Willard, and Charlie Sheen's character ''Topper'' are depicted staring at each other while passing in opposite directions on PBRs on a river. As they meet each shouts in unison, &quot;I loved you in [[Wall Street (movie)|Wall Street]]!&quot;. 
* Another movie starring Charlie Sheen, ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'', has a gag scene after the end credits, in which Sheen quotes Kilgore's famous napalm line.
* In ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', shortly before &quot;Swoff&quot; and the guys are sent into action, they are watching ''Apocalypse Now'' in a theater inside the base, singing along and interacting with the infamous helicopter attack scene, much in the way one would at a ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' screening. Oddly enough, Walter Murch was editor/sound designer for both Apocalypse Now &amp; Jarhead.
* In ''[[Back to the Future Part II (film)|Back to the Future 2]]'', right after Marty meets up with Doc and the police take Jennifer away, you can see a sign behind them reading &quot;Surf Vietnam.&quot;

===Television===
* In an episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[Elaine Benes]] visits her employer, [[J. Peterman]], in a scene that parodies Willard's eventual meeting with Kurtz.
* The same scene is also parodied in an episode of ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', with Captain Murphy as Kurtz and Marco as Willard.
* Parodied in the episode &quot;[[Kamp Krusty]]&quot; of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' with [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] assuming the role of Kurtz. [[Marge Simpson]] also tells her husband, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], in another episode, ''&quot;your character provides the comic relief, like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now&quot;''. The 'Ride of the Valkyries' helicopter sequence was humorously homaged in a &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror]]&quot; short. 
* In an episode of ''[[The Critic]]'', one of the films Jay Sherman reviews is a [[musical]] remake titled &quot;Apocalypse Wow.&quot;
* The episode &quot;Eekpocalypse Now!&quot; of the cartoon series ''[[Eek! the Cat]]'' cast Eek as Willard, Elmo the Elk as Colonel Kilgore and Sharky the Sharkdog as Colonel Kurtz.
* In the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode &quot;Restless,&quot;  contains [[Xander]]'s dream version of ''Apocalypse Now'', including [[Principal Snyder]] as Kurtz.
* [[Claymation]] cartoonist Corky Quakenbush produced &quot;''A Pack of Gifts Now''&quot;, which is part of his [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special)|Rudolph]] Trilogy (the other two being &quot;''Raging Rudolph''&quot; and &quot;''The Reinfather''.&quot;) The short is set in [[Saskatchewan]], with Rudolph in the Willard role and [[Santa Claus]] in the Kurtz role. Rudolph's mission is to &quot;terminate the Kringle (Santa) with extreme prejudice.&quot; This short would air on the Christmas edition of ''[[MadTV]]'' in 1999.
* In the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV show)|Scrubs]]'', the episode &quot;My Heavy Meddle&quot; ends with the janitors comment: &quot; The horror!&quot;, quoting Kurtz.
* In an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'', [[Warner Brothers]] sends Yakko, Wakko and Dot Warner on a mission to stop a crazed movie director (a parody of [[Jerry Lewis]]) from filming a movie the studio had cancelled. The trio find the director, who has created a kingdom for himself in which [[stunt double]]s worship him. They stop the film and smash him with a 50 ton weight. His last words are &quot;The hurting... the hurting...&quot; Throughout the episode, a singer who looks very much like [[Jim Morrison]] drones &quot;This is the ending, the ending of our story, the ending.&quot; 
* &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,&quot; an ''[[X-Files]]'' episode features a flashback scene where &quot;the Cigarette Smoking Man&quot; is tasked with the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]. The scene has many things similar or identical to the Scene where Willard is tasked with the assassination of Kurtz, most prominently both have a question that goes something like &quot;have you ever met myself this man or the general before?&quot; to which Willard and the CSM both reply &quot;Not personally&quot;.
* The cartoon ''[[Yvon of the Yukon]]'' has an episode that parodies the opening scene, as well as a helicopter pilot stating &quot;I love the smell of lip balm in the morning&quot;
* In a sketch in [[Alas Smith and Jones]], [[Mel Smith]] sits in a darkened room and expresses philosophies similar to that of Kurtz at length to a man who has been sent to find him, at the end of the sketch [[Griff Rhys Jones]] switches on the light to reveal that they are in fact sitting in a rather mundane bathroom with Smith sitting in the bath. Jones (a fairly dull [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|tax inspector]] perched on the toilet) reveals that he is merely investigating Smith for [[Child benefit]] fraud.

===Music===

'''Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] ([[13 August]] [[1899]]&amp;ndash;[[29 April]] [[1980]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born [[film]] [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]], closely associated with the [[suspense]] [[thriller]] genre. He began directing in the [[United Kingdom]] before working mostly in the [[United States]] from 1939 onwards, taking out dual citizenship in 1956.  He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades, from the [[silent film]] era, through the invention of [[talkie]]s, to the [[color]] era. Hitchcock remains one of the best known and most popular directors of all time, famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense throughout his movies.

Hitchcock's films draw heavily on both [[fear]] and [[fantasy]], and are known for their droll humour. They often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding. This often involves a ''[[transference]] of guilt'' in which the &quot;innocent&quot; character's failings are transferred to another character and magnified. Another common theme is the exploration of the compatibility of men and women; Hitchcock's films often take a [[cynicism|cynical]] view of traditional romantic relationships.

Although Hitchcock was an enormous [[superstar|star]] during his lifetime, he was not usually ranked highly by contemporaneous [[film critic]]s. ''[[Rebecca (film)|Rebecca]]'' was the only one of his films to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], although four others were nominated. Hitchcock never won the Academy Award for Best Director. He was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]] for lifetime achievement in 1967, but never personally received an [[Academy Award|Academy Award of Merit]].  The [[French New Wave]] critics, especially [[√âric Rohmer]], [[Claude Chabrol]], and [[Fran√ßois Truffaut]], were among the first to promote his films as having [[artistic merit]] beyond entertainment. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film-making process.

Through his fame, public persona, and degree of creative control, Hitchcock transformed the role of the director, which had previously been eclipsed by that of the producer. He is seen today as the quintessential director who managed to combine art and entertainment in a way very few have ever matched. His innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and [[actor]]s.

==Biography==
&lt;!--- The following is okay, with more biographical material, some trimming of minor films, and less of a &quot;laundry-list&quot; exposition ---&gt;

===Early life===
Alfred Hitchcock was born on [[August 13]], [[1899]], in [[Leytonstone]], [[London]], the second son and youngest of the three children of William Hitchcock, a greengrocer, and his wife, Emma Jane Hitchcock (nee Whelan). His family was mostly [[Irish Catholic]]. Hitchcock was sent to Catholic boarding schools in London. He has said his childhood was very lonely and sheltered.

At an early age, after acting childishly, Hitchcock claimed that his father sent him to the local police station carrying a note.  When he presented the police officer on duty with the note, he was locked in a cell for a few moments, petrifying the young child.  This was a favorite anecdote of his, one which is often suggested to be the cause for the theme of distrust of police which runs through many of his films.

At 14, Hitchcock lost his father and left the Jesuit-run [[St Ignatius' College]] in [[Stamford Hill]], his school at the time, to study at the School for Engineering and Navigation. After graduating, he became a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and [[advertising]] designer with a cable company.

About that time, Hitchcock became intrigued by [[photography]] and started working in film in London. In 1920, he obtained a full-time job at Islington Studios under its American owners, [[Famous Players Film Company|Players]]-Lasky, and their British successors, [[Gainsborough Pictures]], designing the titles for silent movies.

===Pre-war British career===
As a major talent in a new industry with plenty of opportunity, he rose quickly.  In 1925, [[Michael Balcon]] of Gainsborough Pictures gave him a chance to direct his first film, ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'', made at the [[Universum Film AG|Ufa studios]] in Germany.  However, the commercial failure of this film, and his second, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'', threatened to derail his promising career, until he attached himself to the thriller genre. The resulting film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'', was released in [[1927 in film|1927]] and was a major commercial and critical success.  Like many of his earlier works it was influenced by [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] techniques he had witnessed first hand in Germany. In it, attractive blondes are strangled and the new lodger ([[Ivor Novello]]) in the Bunting family's upstairs apartment falls under heavy suspicion.  This is the first truly &quot;Hitchcockian&quot; film, incorporating such themes as the &quot;wrong man&quot;.

Following the success of ''The Lodger'', Hitchcock began his first  efforts to promote himself in the media, and hired a publicist to cement his growing reputation as one of the British film industry's rising stars. In 1926, he was to marry his assistant director [[Alma Reville]]. They had a daughter, Patricia, in 1928. Alma was Hitchcock's closest collaborator. She wrote some of his screenplays and worked with him on every one of his films.

In 1929, he began work on ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', his tenth film. While the film was in production, the studio decided to make it one of Britain's first sound pictures. With the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the [[British Museum]], ''Blackmail'' also began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as the backdrop to a story.

In 1933, Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. His first film for the company, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), was a success, while his second, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), is often considered one of the best films from his early period. It was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot;, a plot device around which a whole story would revolve. In ''The 39 Steps'', the MacGuffin is a stolen set of blueprints. 

His next major success was in 1938, ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'', a clever and fast-paced film about the search for a kindly old Englishwoman ([[Dame May Whitty]]), who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Vandrika (a thinly-veiled version of [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]).

By the end of the 1930s, Hitchcock was at the top of his game artistically, and in a position to name his own terms when [[David O. Selznick]] managed to entice the Hitchcocks across to Hollywood.

===Hollywood===
Hitchcock's ''[[gallows humour]]'' continued in his American work, together with the suspense that became his trademark. However, working arrangements with his new producer were less than optimal. Selznick suffered from perennial money problems and Hitchcock was often unhappy with the amount of creative control demanded by Selznick over his films. Subsequently, Selznick ended up &quot;loaning&quot; Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself.

With the prestigious picture ''[[Rebecca (film)|Rebecca]]'' in 1940, Hitchcock made his first American movie, although it was set in England and based on a novel by English author Dame [[Daphne du Maurier]]. This [[Gothic novel|Gothic]] [[melodrama]] explores the fears of a na√Øve young bride who enters a great English country home and must grapple with a distant husband, a predatory housekeeper, and the legacy of her husband's late wife. It has also subsequently been noted for the lesbian undercurrents in [[Judith Anderson]]'s performance. The film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] of 1940.  Hitchcock's second American film, the European-set thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent]]'' was also nominated for Best Picture that year. 

Hitchcock's work during the 1940's was very diverse, ranging from the romantic comedy, ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) and the courtroom drama ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947), to the dark and disturbing ''Shadow of a Doubt'' (1943). 

''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', his personal favorite, was about young Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]), who suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Spencer ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of murder. In its use of overlapping characters, dialogue, and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential, including [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek]]. The film also harkens to one of Cotten's better known films, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.

''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' explored the then very fashionable subject of [[psychoanalysis]] and featured a dream sequence which was designed by [[Salvador Dali]]. The actual dream sequence in the film was considerably cut from the original planned scene that was to run for some minutes but proved too disturbing for the finished film.

''[[Notorious]]'' (1946) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. As Selznick failed to see the subject's potential, he allowed Hitchcock to make the film for [[RKO]]. From this point on, Hitchcock would produce his own films, giving him a far greater degree of freedom to pursue the projects that interested him.  Starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and Hitchcock regular [[Cary Grant]], and featuring a plot about Nazis, uranium, and South America, ''[[Notorious]]'' was a huge box office success and has remained one of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films.  Its inventive use of suspense and props briefly led to Hitchcock being under surveillance by the [[CIA]] due to his use of [[uranium]] as a plot device.  

''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Rope|Rope]]'' (his first color film) came next in 1948. Here Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]''. He also experimented with exceptionally long takes - up to ten minutes (see [[Alfred Hitchcock#Themes and devices|Themes and devices]]).  Featuring [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, ''Rope'' was the first of an eventual four films Stewart would make for Hitchcock.  Based on the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s, ''Rope'' is also among the earliest openly gay-themed films to emerge from the [[Hays Office]] controlled Hollywood studio era.

''[[Under Capricorn]]'', set in nineteenth-century Australia, also used this short-lived technique, but to a more limited extent. For these two films he formed a production company with Sidney Bernstein, called Transatlantic Pictures, which folded after these two unsuccessful pictures.

===Peak years and decline===
With ''[[Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), his first epic film based on the novel by [[Patricia Highsmith]], Hitchcock combined many of the best elements from his preceding British and American films.  Two men casually meet and speculate on removing people who are causing them difficulty. One of the men, though, takes this banter entirely seriously. With [[Farley Granger]] reprising some elements of his role from ''Rope'', ''Strangers'' continued the director's interest in the narrative possiblities of homosexual blackmail and murder. 

Three very popular films, all starring [[Grace Kelly]], followed. ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' was adapted from the popular stage play by Frederick Knott. This was originally another experimental film, with Hitchcock using the technique of [[3-D film|3D]] cinematography, although the film was never released in this format. ''[[Rear Window]]'', starred James Stewart again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Here the wheelchair-bound Stewart observes the movements of his neighbours across the courtyard and becomes convinced one of them has murdered his wife. Like ''[[Lifeboat]]'' and ''[[Rope]]'', the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space: Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set. ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', set in the French Riviera, starred Kelly and [[Cary Grant]]. 

In 1956, Hitchcock also remade his 1934 film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', this time with [[James Stewart]] and [[Doris Day]]. 

1958's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' again starred Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. The film was a commercial failure, but has come to be viewed by many as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. 

Hitchcock followed ''Vertigo'' with three very different films, which were all massive commercial successes. All are also recognised as among his very best films: ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). The latter two were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks, both by [[Bernard Herrmann]]: the screeching strings in the murder scene in ''Psycho'' pushed the limits of the time, and ''The Birds'' dispensed completely with conventional instruments, using an electronically produced soundtrack. These were his last great films, after which his career slowly wound down. In 1972 Hitchcock returned to [[London]] to film ''[[Frenzy]]'', his last major success. For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had before been taboo, in one of his films. 

Failing health slowed down his output over the last two decades of his life.

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was his last film. It related the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover [[Bruce Dern]] making a living from her phony powers. [[William Devane]] and [[Katherine Helmond]] co-starred.

Hitchcock was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the 1980 [[New Years Honours]]. He died just four months later, on [[April 29]], before he had the opportunity to be formally invested by the Queen. He was nevertheless entitled to be known as '''Sir Alfred Hitchcock''' and to use the postnominal letters [[KBE]], because he remained a British subject when he adopted American citizenship in 1956.

Alfred Hitchcock died from [[renal failure]] in his [[Bel Air]], [[Los Angeles]], home aged 80, and was survived by his wife [[Alma Reville]], and their daughter, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell. His body was cremated, and apparently there was no public funeral or memorial service.

==Themes and devices==
Hitchcock preferred the use of suspense over surprise in his films. In surprise, the director assaults the viewer with frightening things. In suspense, the director tells or shows things to the audience which the characters in the film do not know, and then artfully builds tension around what will happen when the characters finally learn the truth.

Further blurring the moral distinction between the innocent and the guilty, occasionally making this indictment clear, Hitchcock also makes voyeurs of his &quot;respectable&quot; audience. In ''Rear Window'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]), after L. B. Jeffries (played by James Stewart) has been staring across the courtyard at him for most of the film, Lars Thorwald (played by [[Raymond Burr]]) confronts Jeffries by saying &quot;What do you want of me?&quot; Burr might as well have been addressing the audience.  In fact, shortly before asking this, Thorwald turns to face the camera directly for the first time &amp;mdash; at this point, audiences often gasp.

One of Hitchcock's favourite devices for driving the plots of his stories and creating suspense was what he called the &quot;[[MacGuffin]].&quot; The plots of many of his suspense films revolve around a &quot;MacGuffin&quot;: a detail which, by inciting curiosity and desire, drives the plot and motivates the actions of characters within the story, but whose specific identity and nature is unimportant to the spectator of the film. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', for instance, &quot;Carlotta Valdes&quot; is a MacGuffin; she never appears and the details of her death are unimportant to the viewer, but the story about her ghost's haunting of Madeleine Elster is the spur for Scottie's investigation of her, and hence the film's entire plot. In ''[[Notorious]]'' the uranium that the main characters must recover before it reaches Nazi hands serves as a similarly arbitrary motivation: any dangerous object would suffice. And state secrets of various kinds serve as MacGuffins in several of the spy films, like ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]''.

Most of Hitchcock's films contain [[cameo role|cameo]] [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|appearances by Hitchcock himself]]: the director would be seen for a brief moment boarding a bus, crossing in front of a building, standing in an apartment across the courtyard, or appearing in a photograph. This playful gesture became one of Hitchcock's signatures. As a recurring theme he would carry a musical instrument &amp;mdash; especially memorable was the large double bass case that he wrestles onto the train at the beginning of ''[[Strangers on a Train]]''. 

In his earliest appearances he would fill in as an obscure extra, standing in a crowd or walking through a scene in a long camera shot. But he became more prominent in his later appearances, as when he turns to see [[Jane Wyman]]'s disguise when she passes him on the street in ''[[Stage Fright]]'', and in stark silhouette in his final film ''[[Family Plot]]''. In another amusing cameo, albeit just a photograph, Hitchcock's picture is seen in the &quot;before&quot;
side of a newspaper weight loss ad in ''[[Lifeboat]]''. (See a [[list of Hitchcock cameo appearances]].)  

Hitchcock includes the consumption of brandy in nearly every sound film.  &quot;I'll get you some brandy. Drink this down. Just like medicine ...&quot; says James Stewart's character to [[Kim Novak]], in ''Vertigo.''  In a real life incident,  Hitchcock dared Montgomery Clift at a dinner party around the filming of ''I Confess'' to swallow a carafe of brandy, which caused his lead actor to pass out, almost immediately. This near obsession with brandy remains unexplained.

Another almost inexplicable feature of any Hitchcock film is the inclusion of a staircase. Of course, stairways inspire many suspenseful moments, most notably [[Farley Granger]]'s character visit to the murderer in ''[[Strangers On A Train]]'' or the detective's demise in the Bates' mansion in ''Psycho.'' However, a completely nonfunctional staircase adorns the apartment of the James Stewart character in ''[[Rear Window]]'', as if Hitchcock feels compelled to its inclusion by some unspoken superstition.

Hitchcock seemed to delight in the technical challenges of filmmaking. In ''Lifeboat'', Hitchcock sets the entire action of the movie in a small boat, yet manages to keep the cinematography from monotonous repetition. His trademark cameo appearance was a dilemma, given the claustrophobic setting; so Hitchcock appeared on camera in a fictitious newspaper ad for a weight loss product.  

In ''Spellbound'' two unprecedented point-of-view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and outsized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-colored red on some copies of the black-and-white print of the film.

''Rope'' (1948) was another technical challenge: a film that appears to have been shot entirely in a single take. The film was actually shot in eight takes of approximately 10 minutes each, which was the amount of film that would fit in a single camera reel; the transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.

His 1958 film ''Vertigo'' contains a camera trick that has been imitated and re-used so many times by filmmakers, it has become known as the [[Hitchcock zoom]].

Although famous for inventive camera angles, Hitchcock generally avoided points of view that were physically impossible from a human perspective. For example, he would never place the camera looking out from inside a refrigerator.

Regarding Hitchcock's sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors, there was a persistent rumor that he had said that actors were cattle.  Hitchcock later denied this, typically [[tongue-in-cheek]], clarifying that he had only said that actors should be treated like cattle.  [[Carole Lombard]], tweaking Hitchcock and drumming up a little publicity, brought some cows along with her when she reported to the set of ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]''.

Hitchcock often dealt with matters that he felt were sexually preverse or kinky, and many of his films darring subverted the restrictive Hollywood Production Code that prohibited any mention of [[homosexuality]].

==His character and its effects on his films==
Hitchcock's films sometimes feature male characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers. In ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]'s character) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him (in this case, they are).  In ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), the [[Rod Taylor]] character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself of a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolizes his mother. The villain Bruno in ''[[Strangers on a Train]]'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Norman Bates' troubles with his mother in ''[[Psycho]]'' are infamous. 

Hitchcock heroines tend to be lovely, cool blondes who seem at first to be proper but, when aroused by passion or danger, respond in a more sensual, animal, perhaps criminal way. As noted, the famous victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]'', Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, [[Madeleine Carroll]], is put in handcuffs. In ''[[Marnie]]'' (1964), glamorous blonde [[Tippi Hedren]] is a [[kleptomania]]c. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), glamorous blonde [[Grace Kelly]] offers to help someone she believes is a cat burglar. After becoming interested in Thorwald's life in ''Rear Window'', Lisa breaks into Thorwald's apartment. And, most notoriously, in ''Psycho'', [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 and gets murdered by a young man named [[Norman Bates]] (played by [[Anthony Perkins]]) who thought he was his own mother. His last blonde heroine was French actress [[Claude Jade]] as the secret agent's worried daughter, Michele, in '''Topaz''' (1969).

Hitchcock saw that reliance on actors and actresses was a holdover from the theater tradition.  He was a pioneer in using camera movement, camera set ups and montage to explore the outer reaches of cinematic art.

Most critics and Hitchcock scholars, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' is probably the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography.

Hitchcock often said that his personal favourite was ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.

==His style of working==
Hitchcock once commented, &quot;The writer and I plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail, and when we're finished all that's left to do is to shoot the film. Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise. Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest.&quot; Hitchcock was often critical of his actors and actresses as well, dismissing, for example, Kim Novak's performance in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', and once famously remarking that actors were to be treated like cattle. (In response to being accused of saying 'actors are cattle', he said 'I never said they were cattle; I said they were to be ''treated'' like cattle'.) 

The first book devoted to the director is simply named ''Hitchcock''. It is a document of a one-week interview by [[Fran√ßois Truffaut]] in 1967. (ISBN 0671604295)

==Awards==
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Hitchcock the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], in 1967.  However, despite six earlier nominations, he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in a contested category. His unsuccessful Oscar nominations were:

* for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]:  ''Rebecca'' (1940), ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Rear Window]]'', and ''[[Psycho]]''; and
* as a producer, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Suspicion]]'' (1941).  

However ''Rebecca'', which Hitchcock did direct, won the 1940 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar for its producer [[David O. Selznick]].  Three other films Hitchcock directed were unsuccessfully nominated for Best Picture.

Hitchcock was knighted in 1980.



==Other notes==
From [[1955 in television|1955]] to [[1965 in television|1965]], Hitchcock was the host and producer of a long-running [[television]] series entitled ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His [[irony]]-tinged voice, image, and mannerisms became instantly recognizable and were often the subject of parody. He directed a few episodes of the TV series himself and he upset a number of movie production companies when he insisted on using his TV production crew to produce his motion picture ''[[Psycho]]''. In the late 1980s, a new version of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions.

Alfred Hitchcock is also immortalised in print and appeared as himself in the very popular juvenile detective series, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators''. The long-running detective series was clever and well written, with characters much younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In ghost-written introductions, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot; formerly introduced each case at the beginning of the book, often giving them new cases to solve. At the end of each book, Alfred Hitchcock would discuss the specifics of the case with Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw and every so often the three boys would give Alfred Hitchcock mementos of their case. 

When Alfred Hitchcock passed away, his chores as the boys' mentor/friend would be done by a fictional character: a retired detective named Hector Sebastian.  Due to the popularity of the series, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators'' scored several reprints and out of respect, the latter reprints were changed to just ''[[The Three Investigators]]''. Over the years, more than one name has been used to replace Alfred Hitchcock's character, especially for the earlier books when his role was emphasised.  

At the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included ''Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum'', ''Alfred Hithcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful.''  Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written. The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a check.

Some notable writers whose works were used in the collection include [[Shirley Jackson]] (''Strangers in Town'', ''[[The Lottery]]''), [[T.H. White]] (''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''), [[Robert Bloch]], [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Mark Twain]] and the creator of ''[[The Three Investigators]]'', [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]].

'''Anacondas''' (Jib√≥ia and Sucuri, local names) are three species of aquatic [[boa]] inhabiting the swamps and rivers of the dense forests of tropical [[South America]] as well as the southern swamps of the island of [[Trinidad]] .

There are two possible origins for the word 'anaconda': It is perhaps an alteration of the [[Sinhalese]] word 'henakanday', meaning 'whip snake', or more likely, the [[Tamil]] word 'anaikolra', which means 'elephant killer', as early [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers in South America referred to the anaconda as 'matatoro', or 'bull killer'. It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake's native habitat, it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large [[Asia]]n [[python]]s.&lt;sup&gt;[http://news2.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/photogalleries/0802_snakes1.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

Two species are well-known:

* The '''Green Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes murinus]]''), which has been reported at over 10 meters (32.8 feet) in length (although most are considerably smaller). Although shorter than the longest recorded species, the [[Reticulated python|Reticulated Python]], it is considerably heavier. In fact, it is the heaviest [[snake]] species in existence. It can weigh 250 kg (551 pounds) and have a girth of more than 30 cm (11.8 inches) in diameter. Females are larger than males, averaging 22-26 feet and 12-16 feet respectively.  These are found mainly in northern [[South America]], in [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], northern [[Bolivia]], northeast [[Peru]], [[Guyana]], and [[Trinidad]]. Although charismatic, very little information was known about the anacondas until [[1992]] when the first study (and so far the only) was made on the field biology of this species in the Venezuelan [[llanos]] by Dr. Jesus Rivas. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.anacondas.org]&lt;/sup&gt;  

* The '''Yellow Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes notaeus]]''), which reaches a relatively smaller average adult length of 3 metres (9.8 feet). These live further south in Bolivia, [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], western Brazil, and northeast [[Argentina]].

The third lesser known species is:

* The '''Dark-Spotted''' or '''Deschauense's Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes deschauenseei]]'') found in northeast Brazil.

''Eunectes murinus'' (formerly called ''Boa murina'') differs from [[Boa]] by the snout being covered with shields instead of small scales, the inner of the three nasal shields being in contact with that of the other side. The general colour is dark olive-[[brown]], with large oval [[black]] spots arranged in two alternating rows along the back, and with smaller white-eyed spots along the sides. The belly is whitish, spotted with black spots. The anaconda combines an arboreal with an aquatic life, and feeds chiefly upon [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s and [[caiman]], mostly during the night. It lies submerged in the water, with only a small part of its head above the surface, waiting for any suitable prey, or it establishes itself upon the branches of a tree which overhangs the water or the track of game.

Like almost all boas, anacondas give birth to live young.

== Giant Anacondas ==

The largest known anacondas measure about 10.6 meters (30.7 feet) long, but unverified reports of much larger snakes have occasionally been made.

One notable account was reported by adventurer [[Percy Fawcett]]. In [[1906]], Fawcett wrote that he had shot and wounded an anaconda in South America; he reported the snake measured some 18.9 meters (62 feet) from nose to tail. 

Once publicized, Fawcett‚Äôs account of the giant snake was widely ridiculed, although he insisted his account was both truthful and accurate. [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] came to his defense arguing that Fawcett was generally honest and reliable when relating things. Furthermore, Heuvelmans noted that mainstream experts were repeatedly forced to revise their limits regarding the maximum size of snakes when confronted with specimens that defied the generally-accepted estimates. At one point in time, 6 meters (20 feet) in length was the widely-accepted maximum size of an anaconda.  These giant snakes are very capable of killing and consuming an adult human being. 

When it sheds, an adult anaconda relieves itself of an average of 2 pounds of skin. An anaconda's skin can stretch up to 30% larger than the original size of the snake.

== In captivity ==

Anacondas have a reputation for bad temperament; that plus the massive size of the green species mean that anacondas are comparatively less popular as pets than other boas, but they are fairly commonly available in the exotic pet trade, with the exception of ''E. deschauenseei''.

The [[festival]] of '''All Saints''', also sometimes known as &quot;All Hallows,&quot; or &quot;Hallowmas,&quot; is a feast celebrated in their honour.  '''All Saints''' is also a Christian formula invoking all the faithful [[saint]]s and [[martyr]]s, known or unknown.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] holiday (''Festum omnium sanctorum'') falls on [[November 1]], followed by [[All Souls Day]] on [[November 2]], and is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], with a [[vigil]] and an [[Octave (disambiguation)|octave]]. The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Church's '''All Saints''' is the first Sunday after [[Pentecost]] and as such marks the close of the [[Easter]] season.

Common commemorations by several churches of the deaths of martyrs began to be celebrated in the 4th century.  The first trace of a general celebration is attested in [[Antioch]] on the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]. This custom is also referred to in the 74th homily of [[John Chrysostom]] ([[407]]) and is maintained to the present day in the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Church.  

The date of festival was changed to November 1 by [[Pope Gregory III]] ([[731]]&amp;ndash;[[741]]) to coincide with the ancient [[Celts |Celtic]] New Year's festival [[Samhain]]. He designated November 1 as the date of the anniversary of the consecration of a chapel in St. Peter's for the relics &quot;of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors, of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world&quot;.  By the time of the reign of [[Charlemagne]], the November festival of All Saints was widely celebrated. November 1 was decreed a day of obligation by the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Louis the Pious]] in [[835]] issued &quot;at the instance of [[Pope Gregory IV]] and with the assent of all the bishops.&quot; 

In [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]], ''ofrendas'' (offerings) are made on this day. In Spain, the play [[Don Juan Tenorio]] is traditionally performed.  In [[Portugal]] and [[France]], people offer flowers to dead relatives. In [[Poland]] and [[Germany]], the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives.  In the [[Philippines]], the day is spent visiting the graves of deceased relatives, where they offer prayers, lay flowers, and light candles, often in a picnic-like atmosphere.  In English speaking  countries, the festival is celebrated with the hymn &quot;For All the Saints&quot;, set to music by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].

The festival was retained after the [[Reformation]] in the calendar of the [[Church of England]] and in many [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches. In the Lutheran churches, such as the [[Church of Sweden]], it assumes a role of general commemoration of the dead (similar to the ''All Souls'' commemoration in the Eastern Orthodox Church that takes place two Saturdays before the beginning of [[Lent]]). In the [[Holidays in Sweden|Swedish calendar]], the observance takes place on the first Saturday of November.  In many Lutheran Churches however, the festival has fallen into disuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Altaic''' is a proposed [[Language families and languages|language family]] which includes 60 [[language]]s spoken by about 250 million people, mostly in and around [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]]. The relationships among these languages remain a matter of debate among historical linguists. Some scholars consider the obvious similarity between these languages as genetically inherited; others propose the idea of the [[Sprachbund]].

Its proponents traditionally considered it to include [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Turkic languages]], the [[Mongolic languages]], the [[Tungusic languages]] (or Manchu-Tungus), and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. [[Ainu language|Ainu]] has occasionally been suggested as a member of Altaic, but that hypothesis is generally rejected.  Castr√©n (1862) put forward a similar view, but classified Turkic with what we would now call [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]. In 1857 [[Anton Boller]] suggested adding Korean and Japanese; for Korean, G. J. Ramstedt and E. D. Polivanov put forward more etymologies in the 1920's. Korean has commonly been linked to [[Japonic_languages|Japonic]], and in [[1971]], [[Roy Miller]] suggested relating it to both Korean and Altaic.  These suggestions have been taken up and developed by various historical linguists such as [[John Whitman]], [[Sergei Starostin]], and [[Alexander Vovin]] (who now rejects a genetic connection between Korean and Japanese).

There have been  some attempts to extend the Altaic family borders by including Ainu (e.g., Street 1962, Patrie 1982), [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]], or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], but these proposals have been rejected by the majority of scholars.

==Controversy==

There are two main schools of thought about the Altaic theory. One is that the proposed constituent language families (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic in the basic theory, with the addition of Korean and Japanese in extended versions) are genetically or &quot;divergently&quot; related by descent from a common ancestor, &quot;Proto-Altaic.&quot; The other school rejects this theory (so it is often called the &quot;Anti-Altaic&quot; school) and argues that the member languages are related by convergence (mainly loan influence).

The Altaic theory is claimed by its opponents to be based mainly on typological similarities, such as [[vowel harmony]], lack of [[grammatical gender]], an [[agglutinative]] typology, and [[loanword]]s.  In fact, its proponents have put together a large variety of grammatical, lexical, and syntactic regular correspondences between the sub-groups of Altaic (e.g., Ramstedt, [[Nicholas Poppe|Poppe]], Martin, Starostin).  However, its opponents explain these as [[loanword]]s, mutual influence, or [[convergence]], arguing that, although the Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic families do have similarities, they are the result of intensive borrowing and long contact among speakers. 

The Altaic theory is highly controversial. While some support it, others (e.g., Doerfer 1963) do not regard Altaic as a valid group and see it as three (or more) separate language families. Other linguists, such as [[Bernard Comrie]] (1992, 2003), argue that Altaic may be part of a larger grouping, such as [[Nostratic]] or [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]].  In contrast, [[J. Marshall Unger]] (1990) believes that languages such as Korean and Japanese may be part of a &quot;macro-Tungusic&quot; family. Vovin rejected the claim for a Koreo-Japonic branch of Altaic on the basis that they have no [[comparative_method|shared innovation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Austrian German''' is any variety of the [[German language]] spoken in [[Austria]]. There is no unitary Austrian [[language]], but a variety of [[High Germanic languages|High German]] [[dialect]]s are spoken. Besides the Germanic languages discussed here, [[minority language]]s such as [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are spoken in parts of the country.

==Overview== 
* [[Standard German]], called ''&quot;High German&quot;'' (German: ''standardsprache'' (by philologists), generally (incorrectly) referred to as ''Hochdeutsch'') in Austria.
* [[Vorarlbergerisch]], spoken in [[Vorarlberg]], is an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect similar to [[Swiss German]].
* All other dialects belong to the [[Austro-Bavarian]] group, which is a common language throughout much of the country.

==Subgroups==
Ordinarily, the latter dialects are considered to belong either to the [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the [[Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] and the former including the dialects of [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Lower Austria]]. The dialect spoken in Vorarlberg is more closely related to [[Swiss German]] than it is to other Austrian dialects, so Austrians from outside Vorarlberg normally cannot understand it.

==Intercomprehensiblity and regional accents==
While strong forms of the various dialects are not normally comprehensible to Northern [[Germany|Germans]], there is virtually no communication barrier to speakers from [[Bavaria]]. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. [[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is most frequently used in [[Germany]] for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria (state)|Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria (state)|Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and it is very easy for an Austrian after a few spoken words to judge which  Austrian dialect someone speaks. However, if it goes into the dialects of the deeper valleys of [[Tyrol]], sometimes even other Tyroleans are helpless to understand the dialect. Speakers from the different [[States of Austria|states]] of Austria can usually easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), with those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the Tyrol being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener. 

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. 

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border to [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language as such.

==Standard German in Austria==
With German being a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[administration|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late [[19th century]] and its manifold particular traditions.

Austrians speaking Standard German can almost always be recognised by their accent, much more so than speakers from most regions of [[Germany]].

When Austria became a member of the European Union, the Austrian variety of the German language (limited to 23 agricultural terms) was ‚Äúprotected‚Äù in the so-called Protocol no. 10 regarding the use of specific Austrian terms of the German language in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty. Austrian German is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognised under international law / EU primary law. All facts concerning ‚ÄúProtocol no. 10‚Äù are documented in Markhardt, Heidemarie: Das √∂sterreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU, Peter Lang, 2005.
==Influence of popular culture==
Dialects are receding in Austria as they are in some other areas of [[Europe]], but it can safely be said that they are more persistent than in most of Germany. Dialects are frequently used in TV series or movies in situation where it is appropriate for the particular character and situation. A classic example of a strong form of Viennese working-class dialect, for example, would be ''[[Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter]]''. However, strong varieties of dialect are not used quite as much as, for example, in Switzerland. For example, educated people in Vienna usually speak a very slight form of dialect or simply Standard German, but with the characteristic Viennese accent and, where it exists, particular Austrian and Viennese vocabulary.

A good reference for the Austrian, Bavarian and other German dialects are the dialect (&quot;Mundart&quot;) editions of [[Asterix]] and [[Obelix]] comic books which are available in [[Viennese language|Viennese]] (three editions with different dialects from inside [[Vienna]]) and at least one for the common Tyrolean dialect and one for a deep Styrian dialect.

      <comment>/* Results requiring ¬¨AC */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]]. It was formulated in [[1904]] by [[Ernst Zermelo]].  While it was originally controversial, it is now used without embarrassment by most mathematicians.  However, there are still schools of mathematical thought, primarily within set theory, that either reject the axiom of choice, or even investigate consequences of axioms inconsistent with AC.

Intuitively speaking, AC says that given a collection of bins, each containing at least one object, then exactly one object from each bin can be picked and gathered in another bin - even if there are [[infinite]]ly many bins, and there is no &quot;rule&quot; for which object to pick from each.

== Statement ==

The axiom of choice states:
:Let ''X'' be a [[set]] of [[non-empty]] sets. Then we can [[choice function|choose]] a member from each set in ''X''.
Stated more formally:
:Let ''X'' be a set of non-empty sets. Then there exists a [[choice function]] ''f'' defined on ''X''. In other words, there exists a function ''f'' defined on ''X'', such that for each set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''.
Another formulation of the axiom of choice states:
:Given any set of mutually disjoint non-empty sets, there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the non-empty sets.

== Usage ==

Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''.&quot;  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice.  For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory.  In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box.  Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on.  There are only finitely many boxes, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end.  The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on.  (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]].)

For certain infinite sets ''X'', it is also possible to avoid the axiom of choice.  For example, suppose that the elements of ''X'' are sets of natural numbers.  Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it takes each set to the least element of that set.  This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set and we can write down an explicit expression that tells us what value our choice function takes.  Any time it is possible to specify such an explicit choice, the axiom of choice is unnecessary.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  So that won't work.  Next we might try the trick of specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers don't have least elements.  For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: If ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So taking least elements doesn't work, either.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: Every subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element.  Perhaps if we were clever we might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot;  The problem then becomes constructing such an ordering, and it turns out that every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice is true.

A proof requiring the axiom of choice is always [[nonconstructive proof|nonconstructive]]: even if the proof produces an object then it is impossible to say exactly what that object is.  Consequently, while the axiom of choice asserts that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, it does not give us an example of one.  Yet the reason why we chose above to well-order the real numbers was so that for each set in ''X'', we could explicitly choose an element of that set.  If we cannot write down the well-ordering we are using, then our choice is not very explicit.  This is one of the reasons why some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice.  For example, [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] posit that all existence proofs should be totally explicit; it should be possible to construct anything that exists.  They reject the axiom of choice because it asserts the existence of an object without telling what it is.

== Independence of AC ==

By work of [[Kurt G√∂del]] and [[Paul Cohen]], the axiom of choice is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF).  This means that neither it nor its negation can be proven to be true in ZF.  Consequently, assuming the axiom of choice, or its negation, will never lead to a contradiction that could not be obtained without that assumption.

So the decision whether or not it is appropriate to make use of the axiom of choice in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory.  The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it: using it cannot hurt (cannot result in contradiction) and makes it possible to prove some propositions that otherwise could not be proved.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZF plus the axiom of choice (ZFC).  However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

One reason that some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of some bizarre counter-intuitive objects.  An example of this is the [[Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox]] which says in effect that it is possible to &quot;carve up&quot; the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotation and translation, reassemble the pieces into two balls each with the same volume as the original.  Note that the proof, like all proofs involving the axiom of choice, is an existence proof only: it does not tell us how to carve up the unit sphere to make this happen, it simply tells us that it can be done.

On the other hand, the [[negation]] of the axiom of choice is also bizarre.  For example, the statement that for any two sets ''S'' and ''T'', the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''T'' or the cardinality of ''T'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''S'' is equivalent to the axiom of choice.  Put differently, if the axiom of choice is false, then there are sets ''S'' and ''T'' of incomparable size: neither can be mapped in a one-to-one fashion onto a subset of the other.

A third possibility is to prove theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation, a tactic preferred in constructive mathematics.  Such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model.  This renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation undecidable.  For example, under such an assumption, the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox is neither true nor false: It is impossible to construct a decomposition of the unit ball which can be reassembled into two unit balls, and it is also impossible to prove that it can't be done.  However, the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox can be rephrased as a statement about models of ZF by saying, &quot;In any model of ZF in which AC is true, the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox is true.&quot;  Similarly, all the statements listed below under [[#Results requiring AC|Results requiring AC]] are undecidable in ZF, but since each is provable in any model of ZFC, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true.

== Weaker forms of AC ==

There are several weaker statements which are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but which are closely related.  A simple one is the [[axiom of countable choice]], which states that a choice function exists for any countable set ''X''.  This usually suffices when trying to make statements about the real numbers, for example, because the rational numbers, which are countable, form a dense subset of the reals.  See also the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], the [[ultrafilter lemma]], the [[axiom of dependent choice]], and the [[Uniformization (set theory)|axiom of uniformization]].

== Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) ==

One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. There are also a remarkable number of important statements that, assuming the axioms of ZF but neither AC nor ¬¨AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.  The most important among them are [[Zorn's lemma]] and the [[well-ordering theorem]]: every set can be well-ordered.  In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering principle.  Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

* [[Set theory]]
** Any [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] countable sets is itself countable.
** If the set ''A'' is [[infinite]], then there exists an [[injective function|injection]] from the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to ''A''.
** If the set ''A'' is infinite, then ''A'' and ''A''√ó''A'' have the same [[cardinality]]. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** [[Trichotomy]]: If two sets are given, then they either have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** The product of any nonempty family of nonempty sets is nonempty. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** Every infinite [[determinacy#Basic notions|game]] &lt;math&gt;G(T,X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is either [[open set|open]] or [[closed set|closed]] is [[determinacy#Basic notions|determined]].

* [[Measure theory]]
** The [[Vitali set|Vitali theorem]] on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s.
** The [[Hausdorff paradox]].
** The [[Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox]].

* [[Algebra]]
** Every [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** Every unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] other than the trivial ring contains a [[maximal ideal]].
** Every [[field (mathematics)|field]] has an [[algebraic closure]].
** Every [[field extension]] has a [[transcendence basis]].
** Every [[category (category theory)|category]] has a [[skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]].
** [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]] needs the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]].
** The [[Nielsen-Schreier theorem]], that every subgroup of a free group is free.
** The [[additive group]]s of '''[[real numbers|R]]''' and '''[[complex numbers|C]]''' are isomorphic. [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-February/009959.html]

* [[Functional analysis]]
** The [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] in [[functional analysis]], allowing the extension of [[linear map|linear functionals]]
** The theorem that every [[Hilbert space]] has an orthonormal basis.
** The [[Banach-Alaoglu theorem]] about [[compactness]] of sets of functionals.
** The [[Baire category theorem]] about [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]s, and its consequences, such as the [[open mapping theorem]] and the [[closed graph theorem]].

* [[General topology]]
** [[Tychonoff's theorem]] stating that every [[product topology|product]] of [[compact]] [[topological space]]s is compact. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** In the product topology, the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a product of subsets is equal to the product of the closures.
** Any product of [[complete space|complete]] [[uniform space]]s is complete.
** A uniform space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.
** Every [[Tychonoff space]] has a [[Stone-Cech compactification]].

== Results requiring ¬¨AC ==

There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We will abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice&quot; by ZF¬¨C.  For certain models of ZF¬¨C, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.
Note that any model of ZF¬¨C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.

*There exists a model of ZF¬¨C in which there is a function ''f'' from the real numbers to the real numbers such that ''f'' is not continuous at ''a'', but for any sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converging to ''a'', lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; f(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=f(a).
*There exists a model of ZF¬¨C in which real numbers are a countable union of countable sets.
*There exists a model of ZF¬¨C in which there is a field with no algebraic closure.
*In all models of ZF¬¨C there is a vector space with no basis.
*There exists a model of ZF¬¨C in which there is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities.

For proofs, see Thomas Jech, ''The Axiom of Choice'', American Elsevier Pub. Co., New York, 1973.

*There exists a model of ZF¬¨C in which every set in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[measurable]].  Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the [[Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox]] which are provable in ZFC.  Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the [[Axiom of dependent choice]], which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of [[real analysis]].
*In all models of ZF¬¨C, the [[Continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] does not hold.

== Results requiring choice in intuitionistic logic, though not classically ==
Interestingly, in various varieties of [[constructive logic]] (in particular, [[intuitionistic logic]]) in which the [[law of excluded middle]] is not assumed, the assumption of the axiom of choice is sufficient to obtain the law of excluded middle as a theorem. To see this, for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P\,,&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;U\,&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 0) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 1) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Set-builder notation]]). By the axiom of choice, there will exist a choice function &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; for the set &lt;math&gt;\{U, V\}\,&lt;/math&gt; (note that, although the axiom of choice isn't classically required in order to obtain choice functions for finite sets, it is necessary here in intuitionistic logic). Since &lt;math&gt;f(U) \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(V) \in V&lt;/math&gt;, this implies &lt;math&gt;[(f(U) = 0) \vee P] \wedge [(f(V) = 1) \vee P]&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;U = V = \{0, 1\}\,&lt;/math&gt;, it must be that &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) = f(V)\,&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P&lt;/math&gt; would imply &lt;math&gt;\neg P \vee P&lt;/math&gt;. As this could be done for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt;, this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle.

The above proof is not valid in all intuitionistic deductive systems.  For example, in the [[intuitionistic type theory]] of [[Per Martin-L√∂f]], the axiom of choice is a theorem, yet excluded middle is not.

[[Image:Checa-HunCharge.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Huns]], led by Attila (right, foreground), ride into [[Italy]].]]

'''Attila the Hun''' ([[Old Norse]]: ''Atle, Atli''; [[Middle High German]]: ''Etzel''; ca. [[406]]&amp;ndash;[[453]] [[Anno Domini|AD]]) was the last and most powerful king of the [[Huns]]. &lt;!--He was from [[Bulgars]] [[clan]] of [[Dulo]]. This information looks bogus. References please--&gt; He reigned over what was then [[Europe]]'s largest [[empire]], from [[434]] until his death. His empire stretched from [[Central Europe]] to the [[Black Sea]] and from the [[Danube|Danube River]] to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. During his rule he was among the direst enemies of the Eastern and Western [[Roman Empire]]s: he invaded the [[Balkans]] twice and encircled [[Constantinople]] in the second invasion. He marched through [[Gaul]] (later [[France]]) as far as [[Orleans]] before being turned back at [[Battle of Chalons|Chalons]]; and he drove the western emperor [[Valentinian III]] from his [[capital]] at [[Ravenna]] in [[452]].

Though his empire died with him and he left no remarkable [[legacy]], he has become a legendary figure in the [[history of Europe]]. In much of [[Western Europe]], he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity. In contrast, some histories lionize him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three [[Norse saga]]s.

==Background and beginnings==
:''Main article: [[Huns]]''

The European [[Huns]] are often thought to have been a western extension of the [[Xiongnu]] (''Xi≈çngn√∫''), (ÂåàÂ•¥) n., a group of [[nomad]] tribes from north-eastern [[China]] and [[Central Asia]]. These people achieved military superiority over their rivals (most of them highly cultured and civilized) by their state of readiness for combat, amazing mobility, and weapons like the [[Hun bow]].

Attila was born around 406. Nothing certain is known about his childhood; the supposition that at a young age he was already a capable leader and a capable warrior is reasonable but unknowable.

Following [[negotiation]] of peace terms in [[418]], the young Attila, at the age of 12, was sent as a child [[hostage]] to the Roman [[Royal court|court]] of Emperor [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]]. In return, the Huns received [[Flavius Aetius]], in a child hostage exchange arranged by the Romans.

Most likely the empire schooled Attila in its courts, customs and traditions and in its luxurious [[lifestyle]], in the hope that he would carry an appreciation of these things back to his own nation, thus serving to extend Roman influence. The Huns would probably have hoped that Attila would enhance [[espionage]] capabilities by the exchange. 

Attila attempted escape during his stay in Rome but failed. He turned his attention to an intense study of the empire while outwardly ceasing to struggle against his hostage status. He studied the internal and [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] of the Romans. He often secretly observed them in [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] conference with [[foreign minister]]s. He learned about [[leadership]], [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] and other essentials suited to future rulers and diplomats.

==Shared kingship==
[[Image:Huns empire.png|thumb|300px|left|The Hunnish empire stretched from the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia into modern [[Germany]], and from the Danube river to the Baltic Sea]]

By [[432]], the Huns were united under [[Ruga]]. In [[434]] Ruga died, leaving his [[nephew]]s Attila and [[Bleda]], the sons of his brother [[Mundjuk]], in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were [[bargain]]ing with [[Theodosius II]]'s envoys over the return of several [[renegade]] tribes who had taken refuge within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day [[Pozarevac|Po≈æarevac]])  and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful [[treaty]]: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the [[Vandals]]), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (ca. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and departed into the interior of the [[continent]], perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the [[walls of Constantinople]], building the city's first [[sea wall]], and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next five years. During this time, they were conducting an [[invasion]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. However, in [[Armenia]], a Persian counterattack resulted in a defeat for Attila and Bleda, and they ceased their efforts to conquer Persia. In [[440]], they reappeared on the borders of the empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been arranged for by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfil their treaty obligations and that the [[bishop]] of Margus (not far from modern [[Belgrade]]) had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube's north bank. They crossed the Danube and laid waste to [[Illyria]]n cities and forts on the river, among them, according to [[Priscus]], [[Viminacium]], which was a city of the [[Moesian]]s in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the barbarians and betrayed the city to them.

Theodosius had stripped the river's defenses in response to the Vandal [[Geiseric]]'s capture of [[Carthage]] in [[440]] and the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] [[Yazdegerd II of Persia|Yazdegerd II]]'s invasion of [[Armenia]] in [[441]]. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyria into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army, having sacked Margus and Viminacium, took Sigindunum (modern [[Belgrade]]) and [[Sirmium]] before halting its operations. A lull followed during [[442]], when Theodosius recalled his troops from [[North Africa]] and ordered a large new issue of coins to finance operations against the Huns. Having made these preparations, he thought it safe to refuse the Hunnish kings' demands.

Attila and Bleda responded by renewing their [[Military campaign|campaign]] in [[443]]. Striking along the Danube, they overran the military centers of [[Ratiara]] and successfully besieged Naissus (modern [[Ni≈°]]) with [[battering ram]]s and rolling towers&amp;mdash;military sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory&amp;mdash;then pushing along the [[Nisava]] they took Serdica ([[Sofia]]), Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]), and [[Arcadiopolis]]. They encountered and destroyed the Roman force outside Constantinople and were only halted by their lack of [[siege|siege equipment]] capable of breaching the city's massive walls. Theodosius admitted defeat and sent the court official [[Anatolius]] to negotiate peace terms, which were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (ca. 1,963 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (ca. 687 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 ''solidi''.

Their desires contented for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. According to [[Jordanes]] (following [[Priscus]]), sometime during the peace following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around [[445]]), Bleda died (killed by his brother, according to the classical sources), and Attila took the throne for himself. Now undisputed lord of the Huns, he again turned towards the eastern Empire.

==Sole ruler==
Constantinople suffered major [[natural disaster|natural]] (and man-made) disasters in the years following the Huns' departure: bloody [[riot]]s between the [[Chariot racing#Byzantine chariot racing|racing factions]] of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]; [[Pandemic|plague]]s in [[445]] and [[446]], the second following a [[famine]]; and a four-month series of [[earthquake]]s which levelled much of the [[defensive wall|city wall]] and killed thousands, causing another [[epidemic]]. This last struck in [[447]], just as Attila, having consolidated his power, again rode south into the empire through [[Moesia]]. The [[Roman military history|Roman army]], under the [[Goths|Gothic]] ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Arnegisclus]], met him on the river [[Vid]] and was defeated&amp;mdash;though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as [[Thermopylae]]; Constantinople itself was saved by the intervention of the prefect [[Flavius Constantinus]], who organized the citizenry to reconstruct the earthquake-damaged walls, and in some places to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. An account of this invasion survives:

: ''The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in [[Thrace]], became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it. ‚Ä¶ And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the [[churches]] and [[monasteries]] and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers.''
::&amp;mdash; Callinicus, in his ''Life of Saint Hypatius''
[[Image:MorThanFeastofAttila.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[M√≥r Than]]'s painting ''The Feast of Attila'', based on a fragment of [[Priscus]] (depicted at right, dressed in white and holding his history):&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;&quot;When evening began to draw in, torches were lighted, and two barbarians came forward in front of Attila and sang songs which they had composed, hymning his victories and his great deeds in war. And the banqueters gazed at them, and some were rejoiced at the songs, others became excited at heart when they remembered the wars, but others broke into tears&amp;mdash;those whose bodies were weakened by time and whose spirit was compelled to be at rest.&quot; &lt;/small&gt;]]

Attila demanded, as a condition of peace, that the Romans should continue paying [[tribute]] in gold&amp;mdash;and evacuate a strip of land stretching three hundred miles east from Sigindunum ([[Belgrade]]) and up to a hundred miles south of the Danube. Negotiations continued between Roman and Hun for approximately three years. The [[historian]] [[Priscus]] was sent as emissary to Attila's encampment in [[448]], and the fragments of his reports preserved by Jordanes offer the best glimpse of Attila among his numerous wives, his [[Scythia]]n fool, and his [[Moors|Moor]]ish [[dwarf]], impassive and unadorned amid the splendor of the courtiers:

:''A luxurious meal, served on [[silver]] plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else, too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was of wood, while to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver. His dress, too, was quite simple, affecting only to be clean. The sword he carried at his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or gems or anything costly.''

&quot;The floor of the room was covered with woollen mats for walking on,&quot; Priscus noted.

During these three years, according to a legend recounted by Jordanes, Attila discovered the  &quot;Sword of Mars&quot;:
:''The historian Priscus says it was discovered under the following circumstances: &quot;When a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound, he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass. He dug it up and took it straight to Attila. He rejoiced at this gift and, being ambitious, thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world, and that through the sword of Mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him.''
::&amp;mdash; Jordanes, ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'' ch. XXXV [http://www.boudicca.de/jordanes3-e.htm (e-text)]

Later scholarship would identify this legend as part of a pattern of sword worship common among the nomads of the [[Central Asia]]n steppes.

==Attila in the west==
[[Image:AttilaTheHun.jpg|frame|An inaccurate sketch of Attila the Hun, probably from the [[19th century]]&lt;!-- my guess --mirv --&gt;, depicts him as [[European]], though the only extant description of his appearance by a Roman court historian states that Atilla had &quot;a flat nose, swarthy dark complexion, broad chest, short stature and small eyes, but full of confidence&quot; among his features, suggesting physical features common among [[Mongolia]]ns.]]

As late as [[450]], Attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful [[Visigoth]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]] in [[military alliance|alliance]] with Emperor [[Valentinian III]]. He had previously been on good terms with the western Empire and its ''[[de facto]]'' ruler [[Flavius A√´tius]]&amp;mdash;Aetius had spent a brief [[exile]] among the Huns in [[433]], and the troops Attila provided against the [[Goths]] and [[Bagaudae]] had helped earn him the largely honorary title of ''magister militum'' in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of [[Geiseric]], who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.

However Valentinian's sister [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], in order to escape her forced betrothal to a [[Roman Senate|senator]], had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help&amp;mdash;and her [[engagement ring|ring]]&amp;mdash;in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such; he accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as [[dowry]]. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother [[Galla Placidia]] convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria; he also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, not convinced, sent an embassy to [[Ravenna]] to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

Meanwhile, Theodosius having died in a riding accident, his successor [[Marcian]] cut off the Huns' tribute in late 450; and multiple invasions, by the Huns and by others, had left the Balkans with little to plunder. The king of the [[Salian Franks]] had died, and the succession struggle between his two sons drove a rift between Attila and Aetius: Attila supported the elder son, while Aetius supported the younger{{ref|rift}}. [[J.B. Bury]] believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom&amp;mdash;already the strongest on the continent&amp;mdash;across [[Gaul]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] shore{{ref|atlantic}}. By the time Attila had gathered his [[vassal]]s&amp;mdash;[[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Rugians]], [[Scirians]], [[Heruls]], [[Thuringians]], [[Alans]], [[Burgundians]], et al.&amp;mdash;and begun his march west, he had declared intent of alliance both with the Visigoths and with the Romans.

In [[451]], his arrival in [[Belgica]] with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong soon made his intent clear. On [[April 7]] he captured [[Metz]], and Aetius moved to oppose him, gathering troops from among the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], and the [[Celts]]. A mission by [[Avitus]], and Attila's continued westward advance, convinced the Visigoth king [[Theodoric I]] (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached [[Orleans]] ahead of Attila{{ref|orleans}}, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aetius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near [[Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne]]. The two armies clashed in the [[Battle of Chalons]], whose outcome commonly, though erroneously, is attributed to be a victory for the Gothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting. Aetius failed to press his advantage, and the alliance quickly disbanded. Attila withdrew to continue his campaign against Italy.

==Invasion of Italy and death==
Attila returned in [[452]] to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging [[Italy]] along the way; his army sacked numerous cities and razed [[Aquileia]] completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian fled from [[Ravenna]] to [[Rome]]; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle. Attila finally halted at the [[Po]], where he met an embassy including the [[prefect]] [[Trigetius]], the [[consul]] [[Aviennus]], and [[Pope Leo I]]. After the meeting he turned his army back, having claimed neither Honoria's hand nor the territories he desired.

[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|275px|right|[[Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' shows Leo I, with [[Saint Peter]] and Saint Paul above him, going to meet Attila]]

Several explanations for his actions have been proffered. The [[Pandemic|plague]] and [[famine]] which coincided with his invasion may have caused his army to weaken, or the troops that Marcian sent across the Danube may have given him reason to retreat, or perhaps both. [[Priscus]] reports that superstitious fear of the fate of [[Alaric I|Alaric]]&amp;mdash;who died shortly after sacking Rome in [[410]]&amp;mdash;gave the Hun pause. [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]'s pious &quot;fable which has been represented by the pencil of [[Raphael]] and the chisel of [[Algardi]]&quot; (as [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] called it) says that the Pope, aided by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], convinced him to turn away from the city. Various historians (e.g. [[Isaac Asimov]]) have supposed that the embassy brought a large amount of gold to the Hunnish leader and persuaded him to abandon his campaign. 

Whatever his reasons, Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube. From there he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had cut off. However, he died in the early months of [[453]]; the conventional account, from Priscus, says that on the night after a feast celebrating his latest marriage (to a beautiful Goth named [[Ildico]]), he suffered a severe [[nosebleed]] and choked to death in a stupor. An alternative to the nosebleed theory is that he succummed to internal bleeding after heavy drinking. His warriors, upon discovering his death, mourned him by cutting off their hair and gashing themselves with their swords so that, says Jordanes, &quot;the greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men.&quot; His horsemen galloped in circles around the silken tent when Attila lay in state, singing in his [[dirge]], according to [[Cassiodorus]] and Jordanes, &quot;Who can rate this as death, when none believes it calls for vengeance?&quot; then celebrating a ''[[strava]]'' over his burial place with great feasting. He was buried in a triple coffin&amp;mdash;of gold, silver, and iron&amp;mdash;with the spoils of his conquest, and his funeral party was killed to keep his burial place secret. After his death, he lived on as a legendary figure: the characters of ''Etzel'' in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' and ''Atli'' in both the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' were both loosely based on his life.

An alternate story of his death, first recorded eighty years after the fact by the Roman chronicler [[Count Marcellinus]], reports: &quot;''Attila rex Hunnorum Europae orbator provinciae noctu mulieris manu cultroque confoditur.''&quot; (&quot;Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife.&quot;){{ref|marcellinus}} The ''Volsunga saga'' and the ''Poetic Edda'' claim that King Atli died at the hands of his wife [[Gudrun]].{{ref|atli_death}} Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than romantic fables, preferring instead the version given by Attila's contemporary Priscus.  The &quot;official&quot; account by Priscus, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock (''The Night Attila Died: Solving the Murder of Attila the Hun'', Berkley Books, 2005 ISBN 0425202720). Based on detailed [[philological]] analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death, given by Priscus, was an ecclesiastical &quot;cover story&quot; and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from [[450]]-[[457]]) was the political force behind Attila's death.

His sons [[Ellak]] (his appointed successor), [[Dengizik]], and [[Ernakh]] fought over the division of his legacy&amp;mdash;&quot;what warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate&quot;  and, divided, were defeated and scattered the following year in the [[Battle of Nedao]] by the Gepids, under [[Ardaric]], whose pride was stirred by being treated with his people like chattel, and the Ostrogoths. Attila's empire did not outlast him.

==Appearance, character, and name==
[[Image:Atli.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Atilla. &lt;br&gt; From an illustration to the [[Poetic Edda]].]] 

The main source for information on Attila is [[Priscus]], a historian who traveled with [[Maximin]] on an embassy from Theodosius II in [[448]]. He describes the village the nomadic Huns had built and settled down in as the size of the great city with solid wooden walls. He described Attila himself as:

: ''&quot;short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with gray; and he had a flat nose and a swarthy complexion, showing the evidences of his origin.&quot;''

Attila's physical appearance was most likely that of an [[Eastern Asia|Eastern Asian]] or more specifically a [[Mongol]], or perhaps a mixture of this type and the Turkic peoples of [[Central Asia]]. Indeed, he probably exhibited the characteristic Eastern Asian facial features, which Europeans were not used to seeing, and so they often described him in harsh terms. 

Attila is known in Western history and tradition as the grim &quot;Scourge of God&quot;, and his name has become a byword for cruelty and [[Barbarian|barbarism]]. Some of this may arise from a conflation of his traits, in the popular imagination, with those perceived in later [[steppe]] warlords such as the [[Mongol]] [[Great Khan]] [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur|Tamerlane]]: all run together as cruel, clever, and sanguinary lovers of battle and pillage. The reality of his character may be more complex. The Huns of Attila's era had been mingling with Roman civilization for some time, largely through the Germanic ''[[foederati]]'' of the border&amp;mdash;so that by the time of Theodosius's embassy in 448, Priscus could identify [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Latin]] as the three common languages of the horde. Priscus also recounts his meeting with an eastern Roman captive who had so fully [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into the Huns' way of life that he had no desire to return to his former country, and the Byzantine historian's description of Attila's humility and simplicity is unambiguous in its admiration.

The historical context of Attila's life played a large part in determining his later public image: in the waning years of the western Empire, his conflicts with Aetius (often called the &quot;last of the Romans&quot;) and the strangeness of his culture both helped dress him in the mask of the ferocious barbarian and enemy of civilization, as he has been portrayed in any number of films and other works of art. The Germanic epics in which he appears offer more nuanced depictions: he is both a noble and generous ally, as [[Etzel]] in the ''Nibelungenlied'', and a cruel miser, as Atli in the ''Volsunga Saga'' and the ''Poetic Edda''. Some national histories, though, always portray him favorably; in [[Hungary]] and [[Turkey]] the names of Attila (sometimes as Atilla in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) and his last wife Ildik√≥ remain popular to this day. In a similar vein, the Hungarian author [[G√©za G√°rdonyi]]'s novel ''A l√°thatatlan ember'' (published in English as ''Slave of the Huns'', and largely based on Priscus) offered a sympathetic portrait of Attila as a wise and beloved leader.

The name Attila may mean &quot;Little Father&quot; in Gothic (''atta'' &quot;father&quot; plus diminutive suffix ''-la'') as many Goths were known to serve under Attila. It could also be of pre-[[Turkish language|Turkish]] ([[Altaic languages|Altaic]]) origin (compare it with [[Ataturk|Atat√ºrk]] and ''Alma-Ata'', now called [[Almaty]]). It most probably originates from ''atta'' (&quot;father&quot;) and ''il'' (&quot;land&quot;), meaning &quot;Land-Father&quot;. [[Atil]] was also the [[Altaic]] name of the present-day [[Volga]] river which may have given its name to Attila.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aegean Sea map.png|thumb|right|The Aegean Sea.]]

The '''Aegean Sea''' is an arm of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], located between the Greek peninsula and [[Asia Minor]]. It is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] by the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosporus]].

== Etymology ==
In ancient times there were various explanations for the name Aegean. It was said to have been named after the town of [[Aegae]], or [[Aegea]], a queen of the [[Amazons]] who died in the sea, or [[Aegeus]], the father of [[Theseus]], who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died. 

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the sea is {{Polytonic|Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±·øñŒøŒΩ Œ†Œ≠ŒªŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÇ}} (Aigaion Pelagos, [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]] Ej√©on P√©laŒ≥os) and Ege Denizi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. A possible etymology is a derivation from the dialect word {{Polytonic|Œ±·º∂Œ≥ŒµœÇ}} (aiges) &quot;waves&quot; ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]; metaphorical use of {{Polytonic|Œ±·º¥Œæ}} (aix) &quot;goat&quot;), hence &quot;wavy sea&quot;, cf. also {{Polytonic|Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªœåœÇ}} (aigialos) &quot;coast&quot;.

== History ==
In ancient times the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations - the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of [[Crete]], and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Civilization of the [[Peloponnese]]. Later arose the city-states of Athens and Sparta among many others that constituted the [[Hellenic Civilization]]. The Aegean Sea was later inhabited by [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Roman Republic|Romans]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Venice|Venetians]], the [[Seljuk Turks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Aegean was the site of the original [[democracy|democracies]], and it allowed for contact between several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite Image]]
The [[Aegean islands]] can be simply divided into seven groups: the [[Thracian Sea]] group, the East Aegean group, the Northern [[Sporades]], the [[Cyclades]], the [[Saronic Islands]] (or [[Argo-Saronic Islands]]), the [[Dodecanese]] and Crete. The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to these islands. Many of the Aegean islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos Island|Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and [[Crete]] to [[Rhodes]], dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean. Many of the islands have safe harbours and bays, but navigation through the sea is generally difficult. Many of the islands are [[volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. There are two islands of considerable size belonging to [[Turkey]] on the Aegean Sea: [[Bozcaada]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Œ§Œ≠ŒΩŒµŒ¥ŒøœÇ ''[[Tenedos]]'') and [[G√∂k√ßeada]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ŒäŒºŒ≤œÅŒøœÇ ''[[Imvros]]'').

The bays in gulfs counterclockwise includes on [[Crete]], the [[Mirabelli Gulf|Mirabelli]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf|Strymonian]] Gulf and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, √áandarlƒ± Gulf, [[ƒ∞zmir]] Gulf, [[Ku≈üadasƒ±]] Gulf, G√∂kova Gulf, G√ºll√ºk Gulf.

==Port towns==

The Aegean Sea has many ports especially on the islands, for ports, see the island chains or its gulfs and bays.

''This article describes the novel by Anthony Burgess. For other uses of the term '''Clockwork Orange''', see '[[Clockwork Orange (disambiguation)]]'.


'''''A Clockwork Orange''''' is a [[science fiction]] and [[dystopian]] [[1962]] [[novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]], and forms the basis for the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|1971 film adaptation]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. 

It is one of Burgess's &quot;terminal novels&quot;, written to provide posthumous income for his wife after Burgess had allegedly been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.

Burgess wrote that the title came from an old [[Cockney]] expression &quot;As queer as a clockwork orange.&quot; [[#References|&amp;sup1;]] Due to his time serving the British [[Colonial Office]] in [[Malaya]], Burgess thought that the phrase could be used to punningly refer to a mechanically responsive (clockwork) non-human (orang, [[Malay language|Malay]] for &quot;person&quot;). The Italian title, &quot;Un'Arancia ad Orologeria&quot; was interpreted to refer to a grenade. Burgess wrote in his later introduction, &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked,&quot; that a creature who can only perform good or evil is &quot;a clockwork orange&amp;mdash;meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by [[god (monotheism)|God]] or the [[Devil]].&quot;

In his essay &quot;Clockwork Oranges&quot;[[#References|&amp;sup2;]] he says that &quot;this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]], or mechanical, laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness.&quot; This title alludes to the protagonist's negatively conditioned responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his free will.

The book was partly inspired by an event in [[1944]], when Burgess' pregnant wife Lynne was robbed and beaten by four [[desertion |U.S. GI deserters]] in a [[London]] street, suffering a [[miscarriage]] and chronic [[gynecology|gynaecological]] problems[[#References|&amp;sup3;]].  According to Burgess, writing the novel was both a catharsis and an &quot;act of charity&quot; towards his wife's attackers - the story is narrated by and essentially sympathetic to one of the attackers rather than their victim.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Set in the near future, the book centres around the life of the fifteen year old protagonist [[Alex DeLarge]]. Alex and his gang roam the streets at night, committing crimes purely for enjoyment.  The crimes described in the book increase in severity, from assault, to robbery, to a fight with rival gang, culminating when the gang breaks into the house of F.D. Alexander and rapes his wife. The gang returns to a bar where Alex hits one of his gang members, Dim, as punishment for Dim's rude behaviour towards a woman who was singing the chorus of ''[[Ode to Joy]]'', classical music being Alex's other passion, apart from violence. This sparks off a tense moment between the two gang members.

The next day, after fighting Dim and George to re-establish his control of the gang following the previous night's dispute Alex agrees, on Pete's suggestion, to rob a house in a rich part of town. Alex tries to persuade the woman living in the house to open the door. The woman refuses and calls the police as a precaution. He gains access to the house through a window, but is confronted by the defiant woman, who defends herself with unexpected strength, he goes for a bust of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and she scratches his face, he manages to knock her out with a silver statue he had previously taken. As he runs out the front door he is struck by Dim who runs off with the rest of the gang just as the police arrive. At the police station we learn that the woman has died.

In prison, Alex hears about an experimental rehabilitation programme called &quot;the Ludovico technique&quot;, which promises that the prisoner will be released upon completion of the two week treatment and will not commit crimes afterwards and manages to become the first patient. The Ludovico technique itself is a form of [[aversion therapy]], where Alex is given a drug that induces extreme nausea while being forced to watch graphically violent films. At the end of the treatment Alex is unable to carry out or even contemplate violent acts as doing so induces crippling nausea.

He is released from prison, but upon returning home he is rejected by his parents. Dejected, Alex contemplates suicide, going to the public library in order to discover what sort of poison he might take to end his life. There he is spotted by one of his former victims, who accompanied by his friends extracts his revenge. Alex is unable to strike back and the police is alerted. The police arrive, but they turn out to be Dim, and Billy Boy, the former leader of a rival gang. They take Alex, beat him up and dump him by the side of the road out in the country.

Alex stumbles to the nearest house for help, which turns out to be that of F.D. Alexander, whose wife Alex had raped and beaten earlier in the book. At first Alex is not recognised as he had always worn a mask, but the reader discovers that F.D. Alexander is in a wheel chair and his wife died from her injuries. Realising that Alex is the same person who had attacked him and his wife some years ago, F.D. Alexander drugs him, locks him in a room and plays Beethoven‚Äôs [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] at full volume. Although previously his favourite piece of music the Ninth was also used as a soundtrack for one of the films that Alex was forced to watch as part of the Ludovico treatment, hence it produces the same nauseating effects on him. Unable to stand the pain Alex throws himself out of the window to try to kill himself. He survives the fall with broken bones and wakes up in hospital informed that his tormentors have been arrested and the Ludovico treatment reversed.

The final chapter begins identically to the first, Alex having formed a new gang and reverted to his previous criminality. But on this particular night he decides not to join them and goes for a walk on his own instead. In a cafe he bumps into one of his old gang member Pete, who is married and has become a respectable member of society. Pete's wife giggles at Alex's rhetoric, and asks Pete &quot;why does he speak like that?&quot; After conversing with Pete and his wife, Alex has an epiphany, renouncing violence on one hand, but on the other concluding that his behaviour was an unavoidable part of youth, and that if he had a son, he would not be able to stop him from doing what he did.

Although the book is divided into three parts, each containing seven chapters, twenty-one being a symbolic number as it was the age that which a child earns his rights at the time, the 21st chapter was omitted from the versions published in the US. The [[Film|film]] adaptation which was directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] follows the American version of the book, ending prior the events of the 21st chapter.  Kubrick claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, but that he certainly never gave any serious consideration to using it.

==Analysis== 
The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang dialect which Burgess invented for the book, called [[nadsat]]. It is a mix of modified [[Russian_language|Russian]] words, [[English_language|English]] slang and words invented by Burgess himself. It serves two functions, firstly Burgess, while wanting to provide his young characters with their own register did not want to use contemporary slang, fearing that this would &quot;date&quot; the book too much. Secondly, the novel graphically describes horrific scenes of violence, which would be shocking even by today's standards, so nadsat is used as a &quot;linguistic veil&quot; to distance the reader from the action on the page.

==Influence==
{{main|List of cultural references to A Clockwork Orange}}
Both the story and individual elements have had a strong influence on [[popular culture]] in general and [[popular music]] in particular.

==Trivia==
* Alex's age at the end of the novel is the same age that the Burgesses' miscarried child would have been at the date of publication, had the child survived the attack on Lynne, been born and grown up.
* The allegedly Cockney phrase ''A Clockwork Orange'' is totally unknown to history: the first recorded use of it is Burgess's title. Quoted in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, Burgess claimed to have first heard the expression &quot;from a very old Cockney in 1945.&quot;
*Burgess claimed that he had typed the title ''A Clockwork Orange'' and then sat down to think of a story to go with it. One early idea apparently involved a strike or riot among apprentices under Elizabeth I.
*As with many writers and their most popular books, this was one of Burgess's least favourite of the books he wrote, and he thought it was overrated.
*Since, in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' the author F. Alexander wrote a book entitled ''A Clockwork Orange'' and it is his wife who is attacked by the droogs, it seems likely Burgess directly inserted some of his own feelings and characteristics into the novel in the form of this character.

'''Amsterdam''', ({{Pronunciation|Nl-Amsterdam.ogg}}) the [[capital]] of the [[Netherlands]], lies on the banks of two bodies of water, the [[IJ (bay)|IJ bay]] and the [[Amstel]] river. Founded in the late [[12th century]] as a small fishing village on the banks of the [[Amstel]],  it is now the largest city in the country and its financial and cultural centre. As of 2005, the population of the city proper is 742,951{{ref|population}}; the population of the greater Amsterdam area is approximately one and a half million.

Amsterdam has one of the largest historic city centres in Europe, dating largely from the 17th century, the Golden Age of the Netherlands, of which it was the focal point. At this time, a series of concentric, semi-circular canals were built around the older city centre, which still defines its layout and appearance today. Many fine houses and mansions are situated along the canals; most are lived in, others are now offices, and some are public buildings.  Some of the narrow brick houses are gradually sinking because they are built on [[pile|piles]] to cope with the marshy subsoil.

The city is noted for many outstanding museums, including the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Van Gogh Museum]], the [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Rembrandt House Museum]], the [[Anne Frank House]], and its world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Concertgebouworkest]], whose home base is the [[Concertgebouw]]. Notable are also its [[red-light district]], ''[[de Wallen]]'', and its numerous &quot;[[coffee shop]]s&quot; selling [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

Although Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, it is neither the capital of the province in which it is located, [[North Holland]] (which is [[Haarlem]]), nor the seat of government (which is [[The Hague]]).

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Amsterdam]]''

[[Image:Amsterdam airphoto.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Historical centre]]
Amsterdam was founded as a fishing village in the [[13th century]]. According to legend Amsterdam was founded by two [[Frisian]] fishermen, who landed on the shores of the Amstel in a small boat with their dog. The damming of the river [[Amstel]] gave it its name.  It was given [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in [[1300]] or [[1301]].  From the [[14th century]] on, Amsterdam flourished, largely on the basis of trade with the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]].

The [[16th century]] brought a rebellion by the Dutch against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors, escalating into the [[Eighty Years' War]] which ultimately led to Dutch independence. The Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance and [[Jew]]s from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], prosperous merchants from [[Antwerp]] (economic and religious refugees from the part of the Low Countries still controlled by Spain), [[Huguenots]] from [[France]] (persecuted for their religion) sought safety in Amsterdam. It was the rich, refined migrants from Flanders who set the tone (their Brabant dialects became the basis of standard written Dutch) and made Holland a [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] power.

[[Image:AmsterdamDamsquar.jpg|thumb|left|Dam Square in the late 17th century: painting by Jan Adriaensz. Berckheyde (Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden)]]
The [[17th century]] is considered Amsterdam's &quot;Golden Age&quot;.  In the early 17th century Amsterdam was the richest city in Europe. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to [[North America]], [[Africa]] and present-day [[Indonesia]] and [[Brazil]] and formed the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the biggest share in the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]. These companies acquired the overseas possessions which formed the seeds of the later Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was the most important point for the trans-shipment of goods in Europe and it was the leading financial centre of the world. Amsterdam's stock exchange was the first to trade continuously. 

The population grew from slightly over 10,000 around 1500 to 30,000 around 1570, 60,000 around 1600, 105,000 in 1622 and almost 200,000 around 1700 (a twenty fold increase in 200 years). Thereafter, the population did not change much for another century and a half. During the century before World War II it almost quadrupled to 800,000, but then remained fairly constant again to this day.

[[Image:River Amstel by Night - Frans Koppelaar.jpg|thumb|200px|River Amstel by Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Painting by [[Frans Koppelaar|Koppelaar]]&lt;/small&gt;]]The 18th and early 19th centuries saw a decline in Amsterdam's prosperity. The wars of the Dutch Republic with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Amsterdam's fortunes reached their lowest point. However, with the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in [[1815]], things slowly began to improve. In Amsterdam new developments were started by people like [[Sarphati]] who found their inspiration in Paris.

The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a train station, and the Concertgebouw were built. At this time the [[Industrial Revolution]] reached Amsterdam. The ''[[Amsterdam-Rhine Canal]]'' was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]] and the ''[[North Sea Canal]]'' to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects improved communication with the rest of Europe and the world dramatically.

[[Image:annefrankmuseum.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;font size='1'&gt;In 2004, 936,432 people visited the museum adjoining #263 Prinsengracht, better known as the Anne Frank House.&lt;/font&gt;]]
Shortly before the [[First World War]] the city began expanding and new suburbs were built. During [[World War I]], the Netherlands remained neutral. Amsterdam suffered a food shortage and heating fuel became scarce.  The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed.

Germany invaded the Netherlands in [[10 May]] [[1940]], taking control of the country after five days of fighting. The Germans installed a Nazi civilian government in Amsterdam that cooperated in the persecution of Jews.  More than 80,000 [[Jew]]s were deported to concentration camps, of whom perhaps the most famous was a young German girl, [[Anne Frank]]. Only 5,000 Jews survived the war. In the last months of the war communication with the rest of the country broke down and food and fuel became scarce. Many inhabitants of the city had to travel to the countryside to collect food. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel.

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Wapen amsterdam.jpg|frame|left]]
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of three [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]'s crosses, aligned vertically, but rotated 90 degrees for the flag. Historians believe they represent the three dangers which have traditionally plagued the city: flood, fire, and pestilence. The city's official motto, ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' (&quot;Valiant, Resolute, Merciful&quot;) which is displayed on the coat of arms, was bestowed on it by [[Queen Wilhelmina]] in 1947 in recognition of the city's bravery during World War II. The lions were added in the sixteenth century.

The crown was awarded to the city in 1489 by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], out of gratitude for services and loans. The crown was a sign of imperial protection and acted as a seal of approval for Amsterdam merchants abroad. The Westertoren also features the imperial crown.

==City government==
''Main article: [[Amsterdam (municipality)]]''

[[Image:Amsterdam 4.89943E 52.37109N.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Satellite image of Amsterdam]]

As all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a mayor, his ''wethouders'' (aldermen), and the municipal council. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into fifteen ''stadsdelen'' (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The ''stadsdelen'' are responsible for many activities that previously had been run by the central city. Fourteen of these have their own council, chosen by a popular election. The fifteenth, Westerpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam, has very few inhabitants, and is governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council.

==Academia==
Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the [[Vrije Universiteit]]. Other institutions for higher education include an art school, De Rietveldacademie, the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, the Hogeschool voor Economische Studies Amsterdam and the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten, which includes the Sweelinck Conservatorium. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning social history, and especially the history of the labour movement. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 1600s, is one of the oldest [[botanical garden]]s in the world, with many old and rare specimens, amongst which the coffee plant that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.

[[Image:Java_Island_Architecture.jpg|thumb|Java Island, in [[IJ (bay)|'t IJ]], is known for its modern architecture.]]

==Public transport==
Public transport in Amsterdam, operated by [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]], [[Connexxion]], and [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], consists of: 

* national and international [[train]] connections
* 3 [[metro]] lines and 1 [[light rail]] line, together the [[Amsterdam metro]]
* 16 [[tram]] lines
* An express tram line (IJtram)
* 55 local bus lines
* regional bus lines
* several [[ferries]] for pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]] (free of charge)
* a Fast Flying Ferry towards [[Velsen]]-Zuid on the North Sea shore

A new underground line, the [[North/South Line]] (''Noord/Zuidlijn'') is under construction. (See also [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]], [[Amsterdam metro]], [[Amsterdam Centraal]]).

===History===
During the construction of the [[Amsterdam metro]], plans to demolish the entire [[Jew]]ish neighbourhood near the [[Nieuwmarkt]] led to strong protests. The metro was still built (wall decorations at the [[Nieuwmarkt]] station are dedicated to the protests), but plans to build a highway through the neighbourhood in the centre of Amsterdam were abolished. In 1975 there was an incident where a planned bombing of the Venserpolder station led to a political scandal when mayor Ivo Samkalden and everyone in the city council, except for [[Roel van Duijn]], instantly and erroneously blamed the left-wing protesters, which was exactly the objective of the right-wing bombers.

[[Image:Amster.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the ubiquitous cyclists in Amsterdam]]

==Private transport==
Many people in Amsterdam use [[bicycle|bicycles]] to get around.  Most main streets have bike paths. Bike racks are ubiquitous throughout the city. In the city centre, driving a car is complicated by traffic jams and limited and expensive parking space.

==Airport==
[[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]], about twenty minutes by train from downtown Amsterdam, is the biggest airport in the Netherlands, and the fourth largest in Europe. It handles about 42 million passengers a year and is home base to [[KLM]].

==Sports==
Amsterdam is the home town of [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]], a team in the [[Dutch Football League]]. Its home base is the modern stadium [[Amsterdam ArenA]], located in the south-east of the city. The team shares that facility with the [[Amsterdam Admirals]], an [[American football]] team.

In 1928, Amsterdam hosted the [[1928 Summer Olympics|Games of the IXth Olympiad]]. The [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] built for the occasion has been completely restored and is now used for cultural and sporting events.

Amsterdam also is home to a famous [[ice rink]], the [[Jaap Eden]] baan. The [[Amstel Tijgers]] play in this arena in the Dutch [[ice hockey]] premier league. In [[speed skating]] many international championships have been fought in the 400-meter lane of this ice rink.

The city also has a [[baseball]] team, the [[Amsterdam pirates]] who play in the Dutch Major League. Three [[field hockey]] teams, Amsterdam, Pinok√© and Hurley, and a [[basketball]] team, the [[Amsterdam Astronauts]] who play in the Dutch premier division and play their games in the Sporthallen Zuid, near the Olympic Stadium.

==Periodic events==
* [[Koninginnedag]], ''Queen's day'', [[30 April]], the former [[Queen_of_the_Netherlands|Queen's]] ([[Juliana_of_the_Netherlands|Juliana]]) birthday
* [[Uitmarkt]], last weekend in August, the start of the cultural season
* ''Amsterdam Roots'', last week of June. International music festival
* ''Amsterdam Pride'', mid-August, [[gay pride]] weekend

[[Image:Automobiles.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A small variety of cars, the most popular kind of automobile.]]

An '''automobile'''  is a [[wheel]]ed [[vehicle]] that carries its own [[motor]]. Different types of automobiles include cars, [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[van]]s, and [[motorcycles]], with cars being the most popular. The term is derived from Greek 'autos' (''self'') and Latin 'mov√©re' (''move''), referring to the fact that it 'moves by itself'. Earlier terms for automobile include '[[Brass Era car|horseless carriage]]' and 'motor car'. An automobile has seats for the [[driving|driver]] and, almost without exception, one or more passengers. It is the main source of [[transportation]] across the world.

[[As of 2005]] there are 500 million cars worldwide (0.074 per capita), of which 220 million are located in the [[United States]] (0.75 per capita).

==History==
{{main|History of the automobile}}

===The history of automobiles=== The modern automobile powered by the Otto gasoline engine was invented in Germany by [[Karl Benz]]. Even though Karl Benz is credited with the invention of the modern automobile, several other German engineers worked on building the first automobile at the same time. These inventors are: [[Karl Benz]] on [[July 3]], [[1886]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Stuttgart]] (also inventors of the first motor bike) and in 1888/89 [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrian]] inventor [[Siegfried Marcus]] in [[Vienna]], although Marcus didn't go beyond the prototype stage.
{{Automobile history eras}}

==='''Steam powered vehicles'''===
[[Steam-power]]ed self-propelled cars were devised in the late [[18th century]]. The first self-propelled car was built by [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] in [[1769]], it could attain speeds of up to 6 km/h. In [[1771]] he designed another steam-driven car, which ran so fast that it rammed into a wall, producing the world‚Äôs first [[car accident]].

===The Internal Combustion Engine===
In 1806 [[Fransois Isaac de Rivaz]], a Swiss, designed the first [[internal combustion engine]] (sometimes abbreviated &quot;ICE&quot; today). He subsequently used it to develop the world‚Äôs first vehicle to run on such an engine, one that used a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to generate [[energy]]. It was not very successful, as was the case with the British inventor, Brown, and the American inventor, Morey, who produced clumsy IC-engine-powered vehicles about 1826.

Etienne Lenoir produced the first successful internal-combustion engine in 1860, and within a few years, about 400 were in operation in Paris.  In about 1863, Lenoir installed his engine in a vehicle.  It seems to have been powered by city lighting-gas in bottles, and was said by Lenoir to have &quot;travelled slower than a man could walk, with breakdowns being frequent.&quot;  Lenoir, in his patent of 1860, included the provision of a carburettor, so liquid fuel could be substituted for gas, particularly for mobile purposes, i.e., vehicles.  Lenoir is said to have tested liquid fuel, such as alcohol, in his stationary engines; but it doesn't appear he used them in his vehicle.  If he did, he most certainly didn't use gasoline, as this was not well-known and was considered a waste product.

The next innovation comes in the late 1860s, with [[Siegfried Marcus]], a German working in Vienna, Austria.  He developed the idea of using gasoline as a fuel in a two-stroke internal-combustion engine.  In 1870, he built a crude vehicle, with no seats, steering or brakes, but it was spectacular for one reason:  it was the world's first internal-combustion-engine-powered vehicle fueled by gasoline.  It was tested in Vienna in September of 1870.  In 1888/1889, he built a second car, this one with seats, brakes and steering, and a four-stroke engine of his own design.  

The four-stroke engine had already been written down and patented in 1862 by the Frenchman Beau de Rochas in a long-winded and rambling pamphlet.  He printed about 300 copies of his pamphlet and they were distributed in Paris, but nothing came of this, with the patent expiring soon after and the pamphlet disappearing into total obscurity.  In fact, hardly anyone knew of it to begin with.  Beau de Rochas never built a single engine.  

Most historians agree that Nikolaus Otto of Germany built the world's first four-stroke engine.  He knew nothing of Beau de Rochas's patent or idea, and came upon the idea entirely on his own; in fact, he began thinking about it in 1861, but abandoned the idea until the mid-1870's. There is some evidence, although not conclusive, that one Christian Reithmann, an Austrian living in Germany, had built a four-stroke engine entirely on his own by 1873.  Reithmann had been experimenting with IC-engines as early as 1852.

In 1883, Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville and Leon Malandin of France installed an internal-combustion engine powered by a tank of city gas on a tricycle.  As they tested the vehicle, the tank hose came loose, resulting in an explosion.  In 1884, Delamare-Deboutteville and Malandin built and patented a second vehicle.  This one consisted of two four-stroke, liquid-fueled engines mounted to an old four-wheeled horse cart.  The patent, and presumably the vehicle, contained many innovations, some of which wouldn't be used for decades.  However, during the vehicle's first test, the frame broke apart, the vehicle literally &quot;shaking itself to pieces,&quot; in Malandin's own words.  No more vehicles were built by the two men, and their venture went completely unnoticed and their patent unexploited. No one else knew of the vehicles and experiments until years later.  

Supposedly in the late 1870's, an Italian named Murnigotti patented the idea of installing an IC engine on a vehicle, although there is no evidence one was built.  In 1884, Enrico Bernardi, another Italian, installed an IC engine on his son's tricycle.  Although nothing more than a toy, it is said to have operated somewhat successfully in one source, but another says the engine's power was too feeble to make the vehicle move.

But if all of the above experiments hadn't taken place, the development of the automobile wouldn't have been retarded by so much as a moment, since they were unknown experiments that went no further than the testing stage.  The internal-combustion-engined car really can be said to have begun with Benz and Daimler in 1886, for their vehicles were successful, they went into series-production, and they inspired others.

Benz, after building his first three-wheeled car in 1885, built improved versions in 1886 and 1887, and went into production in 1888 -- the world's first vehicle to do so.  Approximately 25 were built until 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced. They were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products.  Because France was more open to the automobile in general, more were built and sold in France than by Benz himself in Germany. 

Daimler built a car in 1886 - a new horse carriage fitted with his new high-speed 4-stroke engine.  In 1889, he built two vehicles from scratch, with several innovations.  From about 1890-1895 about 30 vehicles were built by Daimler and his innovative assistant, Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after having a falling out with their backers.

In 1890, Emile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began series-producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the motor industry in France. They were inspired by Daimler's Stalhradwagen of 1889, which was exhibited in Paris in 1889. 

The first American automobile with gasoline-powered [[internal combustion engine]]s was supposedly designed in 1877 by [[George Baldwin Selden]] of [[Rochester, New York]], who applied for a patent on the automobile in 1879.  Selden didn't build a single car until 1905, when he was forced to do so due to the lawsuit.  Selden received his patent and later sued the Ford Motor Company for infringing his patent.  Henry Ford was notoriously against the American patent system, and Selden's case against Ford went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], who ruled that Ford and everyone else was free to build automobiles without paying royalties to Selden, since automobile technology had improved since Selden's patent, and no one was building those antiquated designs.


Meanwhile, notable advances in steam power evolved in [[Birmingham]], England by the [[Lunar Society]]. It was here that the term [[horsepower]] was first used. It was in Birmingham also that the first British four wheel [[petrol]]-driven automobiles were built in 1895 by [[Frederick William Lanchester]] who also patented the [[disc brake]] in the city. [[Electric vehicle]]s were produced by a small number of manufacturers.

===Innovation===
[[Image:Olds2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ransom E. Olds, the creator of the Assembly line]]
The first automobile [[patent]] in the [[United States]] was granted to [[Oliver Evans]] in 1789; in 1804 Evans demonstrated his first successful self-propelled vehicle, which not only was the first automobile in the US but was also the first [[amphibious vehicle]], as his steam-powered vehicle was able to travel on [[wheel]]s on land and via a [[paddle wheel]] in the water.

On [[5 November]], [[1895]], [[George B. Selden]] was granted a United States patent for a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] automobile engine ({{US patent|549160}}). This patent did more to hinder than encourage development of autos in the USA. A major breakthrough came with the historic drive of [[Bertha Benz]] in 1888. Steam, electric, and gasoline powered autos competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s.

[[Image:Bentley Continental GT dashboard.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The interior of a modern luxury car, a [[Bentley Continental GT]]]]

The large scale, [[production-line]] manufacturing of affordable automobiles was debuted by [[Oldsmobile]] in 1902, then greatly expanded by [[Henry Ford]] in the 1910s. Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric [[ignition system|ignition]] and the electric self-starter (both by [[Charles Kettering]], for the [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]] Motor Company in 1910-1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.

===Model changeover and design change===

[[Image:2000 Ford Taurus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Ford Taurus]], a modern family car which has gone through a number of changes.]]
Cars are not merely continually perfected mechanical contrivances; since the 1920s nearly all have been mass-produced to meet a market, so marketing plans and manufacture to meet them have often dominated automobile design. It was [[Alfred P. Sloan]] who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one firm, so that buyers could &quot;move up&quot; as their fortunes improved. The makes shared parts with one another so that the larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1950s, [[Chevrolet]] shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with [[Pontiac]]; the LaSalle of the 1930s, sold by [[Cadillac]], used the cheaper mechanical parts made by the Oldsmobile division.

==Alternative fuels and batteries==
{{main|Alternative fuel cars}}
With heavy [[tax]]es on fuel, particularly in [[Europe]] and tightening environmental [[law]]s, particularly in [[California]], and the possibility of further restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, work on alternative power systems for vehicles continues.

[[Diesel]]-powered cars can run with little or no modification on 100% pure [[biodiesel]], a fuel that can be made from [[vegetable oil]]s. Many cars that currently use gasoline can run on ethanol, a fuel made from plant sugars. Most cars that are designed to run on gasoline are capable of running with 15% ethanol mixed in, and with a small amount of redesign, gasoline-powered vehicles can run on ethanol concentrations as high as 85%. All petrol fuelled cars can run on [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]]. There has been some concern that the ethanol-gasoline mixtures prematurely wear down seals and gaskets.  Further, the use of higher levels of alcohol requires that the automobile carry/use twice as much.  Therefore, if your vehicle is capable of 300 miles on a 15-gallon tank, the efficiency is reduced to approximately 150 miles.  Of course, certain measures are available to increase this efficiency, such as different camshaft configurations, altering the timing/spark output of the ignition, or simply, using a larger fuel tank.

In the [[United States]], alcohol fuel was produced in corn-alcohol [[still]]s until [[Prohibition]] criminalized the production of alcohol in 1919. [[Brazil]] is the only country which produces ethanol-running cars, since the late 1970s.

Attempts at building viable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered electric vehicles continued throughout the 1990s (notably [[General Motors]] with the [[EV1]]), but cost, speed and inadequate driving range made them uneconomical.  Battery powered cars have used [[lead-acid batteries]] which are greatly damaged in their recharge capacity if discharged beyond 75% on a regular basis and [[Nickel metal hydride|NiMH batteries]].

Current research and development is centered on &quot;[[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]]&quot; vehicles that use both electric power and internal combustion.  The first hybrid vehicle available for sale in the USA was the [[Honda Insight]].  As of 2005, The car is still in production and achieves around 60 mpg.

Other R&amp;D efforts in alternative forms of power focus on developing [[fuel cells]], alternative forms of combustion such as [[Gasoline Direct Injection|GDI]] and [[HCCI]], and even the stored energy of compressed air (see [[water Engine]]).

==Safety==
[[Image:Eurocar.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Mini]] in Paris, France]]
Automobiles were a significant improvement in safety on a per passenger mile basis, over the horse based travel that they replaced. Millions have been able to reach medical care much more quickly when transported by [[ambulance]].

[[Car accident|Accidents]] seem as old as automobile vehicles themselves. [[Joseph Cugnot]] crashed his steam-powered &quot;Fardier&quot; against a wall in 1770. The first recorded automobile fatality was [[Bridget Driscoll]] on [[1896-08-17]] in [[London]] and the first in the [[United States]] was [[Henry Bliss]] on [[1899-09-13]] in [[New York City, NY]].

Cars have two basic safety problems: They have human drivers who make mistakes, and the wheels lose traction near a half gravity of deceleration. [[Automated highway system|Automated control]] has been seriously proposed and successfully prototyped. Shoulder-belted passengers could tolerate a 32[[Gee|G]] emergency stop (reducing the safe intervehicle gap 64-fold) if high-speed roads incorporated a steel rail for emergency braking. Both safety modifications of the roadway are thought to be too expensive by most funding authorities, although these modifications could dramatically increase the number of vehicles that could safely use a high-speed highway.

Early safety research focused on increasing the reliability of brakes and reducing the flammability of fuel systems. For example, modern engine compartments are open at the bottom so that fuel vapors, which are heavier than air, vent to the open air. Brakes are hydraulic so that failures are slow leaks, rather than abrupt cable breaks. Systematic research on crash safety started in 1958 at [[Ford Motor Company]]. Since then, most research has focused on absorbing external crash energy with crushable panels and reducing the motion of human bodies in the passenger compartment.

There are standard tests for safety in new automobiles, like the [[EuroNCAP]] and the [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/testing/ncap/ US NCAP] tests. There are also tests run by organizations such as [http://www.hwysafety.org/ IIHS] and backed by the insurance industry.

Despite technological advances, there is still significant loss of life from car accidents: About 40,000 people die every year in the [[U.S.]], with similar figures in [[Europe]]. This figure increases annually in step with rising population and increasing travel if no measures are taken, but the rate [[per capita]] and per mile travelled decreases steadily. The death toll is expected to nearly double worldwide by 2020. A much higher number of accidents result in injury or permanent [[disability]]. The highest accident figures are reported in China and India. The European Union has a rigid program to cut the death toll in the EU in half by 2010 and member states have started implementing measures.

==Current Production==
In 2005 63 million cars and light trucks were produced worldwide. The world's biggest car producer (including light trucks) is the European Union with 29% of the world's production. In non-EU Eastern Europe another 4% are produced. The second largest manufacturer is NAFTA with 25.8%, followed by Japan with 16.7%, China with 8.1%, MERCOSUR with 3.9%, India with 2.4% and the rest of the world with 10.1%. (vda-link)

Large free trade areas like EU, NAFTA and MERCOSUR attract manufacturers worldwide to produce their products within them and without currency risks or customs, additionally to being close to customers. Thus the production figures do not show the technological ability or business skill of the areas. In fact much if not most of the Third World car production is used western technology and car models (and sometimes even complete obsolete western factories shipped to the country), which is reflected in the patent statistic as well as the locations of the r&amp;d centers.

The automobile industry is dominated by relatively few large corporations (not to be confused with the much more numerous brands), the biggest of which (by numbers of produced cars) are currently [[General Motors]], [[Toyota]] and [[Ford Motor Company]]. It is expected, that Toyota will reach the No.1 position in 2006. The most profitable per-unit carmaker of recent years has been Porsche due to their premium price tag.

The automotive industry at large still suffers from high under-utilization of its manufacturing potential.

==Future of the car==
In order to limit deaths, there has been a push for self-driving automobiles.  Much of the drive for computer-driven vehicles has been led by [[DARPA]] with their [http://www.grandchallenge.org/ Grand Challenge] race.

A current and powerful invention was ESP by Bosch and many followers that reduces deaths by about 30% and is recommended by many lawmakers and carmakers to be a standard feature in all cars sold in the EU. ESP recognizes dangerous situations and corrects the drivers input for a short moment to stabilize the car. 

The biggest threat to automobiles is the declining supply of oil, which does not completely stop car usage but makes it significantly more expensive. Beginning of 2006 a gallon of gas costs approx. 6 US$ in Germany and other European countries. If no cheap solution can be found in the relatively near future individual mobility might suffer a major setback. Nevertheless, individual mobility is highly prized in modern societies so the demand for automobiles will remain just with a different power source.

Looking at automotive technology some areas appear to have the most need of development. For example, both the rubber tires and the batteries currently used by most cars seem rather antiquated when compared to,say, modern-day engines and traction-control systems. These are like jets with cardboard wings or PCs with 10 KB hard drives respectively. While slow moving cars can control their wheels via ESP reasonably well, fast moving vehicles like a Bugatti Veyron need a special tire checkup before approaching 400 km/h. Also the existing batteries are barely fit to handle the cars electronics but are far off from the ability to store enough energy for moving the car unassisted.

'''Audi''' is an [[automobile]] maker in [[Germany]], and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. The company is headquartered in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

Audi's German [[tagline]] is &quot;[[Vorsprung durch Technik]]&quot;. The [[tagline]] is used either in original or in its English translation &quot;Progress through Technology&quot;.

==History==
[[Image:Audi NSU range (1969).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Press photograph of the then newly merged Audi NSU range, 1969.]]
===The origins of Audi===
The company traces its origins back to 1899 and [[August Horch]]. The first Horch automobile was produced in 1901 in [[Zwickau]], in former [[East Germany]]. In 1910, Horch was forced out of the company he had founded. He then started a new company in Zwickau and continued using the Horch brand. His former partners sued him for [[trademark]] infringement and a German court determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. August Horch was forced to refrain from using his own [[family name]] in his new car business. As the word &quot;horch!&quot; translates to &quot;listen!&quot; in [[German language|German]], August Horch settled on the [[Latin]] equivalent of his name - &quot;audi!&quot;. It is also popularly believed that Audi is an acronym which stands for &quot;Auto Union [[Germany|Deutschland]] [[Ingolstadt]]&quot;. Audi produces over 2 million vehicles annually at its main production site in [[Ingolstadt]]. Audi has another production plant in Neckarsulm.

Audi started with a 2612 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] model followed by a four cylinder model with 3564 cc, as well as 4680 cc and 5720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. August Horch left the Audi company in 1920. The first six cylinder model (4655 cc) appeared in 1924. In 1928, the company was acquired by [[J S Rasmussen]], owner of [[DKW]], who bought the same year the remains of the US [[automobile manufacturer]], [[Rickenbacker]] including the manufacturing equipment for eight cylinder engines. These engines were used in ''Audi Zwickau'' and ''Audi Dresden'' models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six cylinder and a small four cylinder (licensed from [[Peugeot]]) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.

===The Auto Union era===
In 1932 Audi merged with [[Horch]], [[DKW]] and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] to form the [[Auto Union]].
Before [[World War II]], Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. This badge was used, however, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.

===Pause and a new start===
Auto Union plants were heavily bombed and partly destroyed during [[World War II]]. After the war, Zwickau soon became part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and Audi headquarters were moved to [[Ingolstadt]]. In that period, the four interlinked rings were used together with the DKW badge. The company focused efforts on the DKW brand, but their [[two-stroke]] engines became unpopular. In 1958, [[Daimler-Benz]] acquired 88 per cent of Auto Union and the next year became its sole owner. Daimler-Benz developed a 72 hp (54 kW) four-door sedan, with a modern [[four stroke engine]] driving the front wheels. This model appeared in September 1965, &quot;relaunching&quot; the Audi brand. Daimler-Benz sold the company to [[Volkswagen]] in 1964; subsequently, Volkswagen's purchase of Auto Union has led to the modernization of VW to which it gained expertise in manufacturing water-cooled vehicles.  Today, aircooled powerplants once produced by VW are no longer placed into production vehicles since December 23, 2005.  
[[image:Audi_60.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi 60 (1968 - 1972)]]
In 1969, Audi merged with [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]], based in [[Neckarsulm]] near [[Stuttgart]]. In the [[1950s]] NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of [[motorcycle]]s but had moved on to produce small cars like the [[NSU Prinz]] (the TT and TTS versions are still popular as vintage race cars). NSU then focused on new rotary engines according to the ideas of [[Felix Wankel]]. In 1967, the new [[NSU Ro 80]] was a space-age car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, safety, et cetera, but teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. Presently several lines of Audi cars are produced in Neckarsulm.

The mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the K70, was intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic Ro 80. However, Volkswagen took the K70 for its own range, spelling the end of NSU as a separate brand.

===The modern era of Audi===
[[image:audi.quatro.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi Quattro]]
[[Image:Audi.tt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi TT]]

The first Audi of the modern era was the [[Audi 100]] of 1968. This was soon joined by the [[Audi 80|Audi 80/Fox]] (which formed the basis for the 1973 [[Volkswagen Passat]]) in 1972.

The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer [[Jorg Bensinger]] was accepted to develop the [[four-wheel drive]] technology in [[Volkswagen]]'s [[Iltis]] military vehicle for an Audi performance car and [[Rallying|rally]] racing car. The performance car was named the &quot;[[Quattro]],&quot; a turbocharged coup√© which was also the first production vehicle to feature full-time all-wheel drive through a center [[differential]].  Commonly referred to as the &quot;Ur-Quattro&quot; (the &quot;[[Ur-]]&quot; prefix is a German [[augmentative]] used, in this case, to mean &quot;original&quot; and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's S4 and S6 sport sedans, as in &quot;UrS4&quot; and &quot;UrS6&quot;), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team) but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology,  

In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of &quot;grandfather's car&quot; image, the type 89 was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant [[Audi 90]], which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early nineties, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.

This decline in sales was not helped in the [[United States|USA]] by a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report which purported to show that Audi automobiles suffered from &quot;unintended acceleration&quot;. The ''60 Minutes'' report was based on customer reports of acceleration when the brake pedal was pushed. Independent investigators concluded that this was most likely due to a close placement of the accelerator and brake pedals (unlike American cars), and the inability, when not paying attention, to distinguish between the two. (In race cars, when manually downshifting under heavy braking, the accelerator has to be used in order to match revs properly, so both pedals have to be close to each other to be operated by the right foot at once, toes on the brake, heels on the gas. US citizens are used to automatic gearboxes and only two well separated pedals). This was never an issue in Europe, as Europeans in general use manual transmission gears, and have a &quot;feeling&quot; for vehicle revs in comparison to the speed of the car.

''60 Minutes'' ignored this fact and rigged a car to perform in an uncontrolled manner. The report immediately crushed Audi sales, and Audi renamed the affected model (The 5000 became the 100/200 in 1989, as in Germany and elsewhere). Audi had contemplated withdrawing from the American market until sales began to recover in the mid-1990s. The turning point for Audi was the sale of the new A4 in 1996, and with the release of the A4/6/8 series, which was developed together with VW and other sister brands (so called &quot;platforms&quot;).

Currently, Audi's sales are growing strongly in Europe, and the company is renowned for having the best build quality of any mainstream auto manufacturer. 2004 marked the 11th straight increase in sales, selling 779,441 vehicles worldwide. Record figures were recorded from 21 out of about 50 major sales markets. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). In March of 2005, Audi is building its first two dealerships in India following its high increase in sales in that region. Though its brand still doesn't have the global cachet of [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[BMW]], Audi's reputation for quality and understated style has once again made it a highly desirable marque.

However, after 2003, with the release of the new A4, and in 2004 with the new A6, Audi's dedication to quality had finally paid off when it started to receive news reports and various vehicle critics praising Audis over [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]].

==Auto racing==
Audi has competed in (and sometimes dominated) numerous forms of [[auto racing]]. Audi's rich tradition in motorsport began with the [[Auto Union]] in the 1930s. In the 1990s Audi dominated the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing Stateside. 

===Rallying===
In 1980 Audi released the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]], an [[all wheel drive]] turbocharged car that went on to win [[rally racing|rallies]] and races worldwide. It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of all-wheel-drive in competition racing. Many critics doubted the viability of all-wheel-drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was an instant success, winning its first rally on its first outing. It won competition after competition for the next two years.

In 1984 Audi launched the &quot;[[Quattro|Sport Quattro]]&quot; car which dominated races in [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Sweden]] with Audi taking all podium finishes but succumbed to problems further into [[WRC|World Rally Championship]] contention. After another season mired in mediocre finishes, Walter R√∂hrl finished the season in his Sport Quattro S1 and helped place Audi second in the manufacturer's points. Audi also received rally honors in the [[Hong Kong]] to [[Beijing]] rally in that same year. Mich√®le Mouton, the first female WRC driver to win a championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the S1 and raced in the [[Pikes Peak|Pikes Peak Hill Climb]]. The climb race pits a driver and car to drive up a 4,302 meter high mountain in [[Colorado]] and in 1985, Mich√®le Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39 and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In 1986, Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in Portugal involving driver Joaquim Santos in his RS200. Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30. [[Bobby Unser]] used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.

===Motorsports in the USA===
In 1987, Walter R√∂hrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1 he retired from the WRC in 2 years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi's time-tested 5-cylinder turbo charged engine and generated over 600 hp (447 kW). The engine was mated to a 6-speed gearbox and ran on Audi's famous all-wheel drive system. All of Audi's top drivers drove this beast, Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter R√∂hrl and the female driver, Mich√®le Mouton. The Audi S1 enjoys a 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) time of 2.3 s. This Audi S1 started the S-series of cars for Audi which now represents an increased level of sports options and quality to the Audi line up.

As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose first into America with the [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] in 1988, 

In 1989, Audi moved to [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA GTO]] with the [[Audi 90|90]], however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title. 
===Touring cars===
In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in the United States, Audi returned to Europe turning first to the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|DTM]] series with the [[Audi V8]], then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast growing [[Supertouring]] series, which took place nationally, first in the [[French Supertourisme]] and [[Italian Superturismo]]. In the following year, Audi would switched to the German [[Super Tourenwagen]] (known as STW) and then to [[BTCC]] (British Touring Car Championship) the year after that.

The [[FIA]], having difficulty regulating the Quattro system and what impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four wheel drive cars from competiting in 1998, by then Audi switched all their works efforts to sportscar racing.

By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their [[Audi RS4|RS4]] for the [[SPEED World Challenge|SCCA Speed World GT Challenge]], through dealer/team [[Champion Racing]] competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an [[Audi RS6|RS6]]. Once again, the quattro was superior and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title but a newcomer, Cadillac, gave them a run for their money.  After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car's performance.

In 2004, after years of competiting with the TT-R in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team [[Abt|Abt Racing]] taking the 2002 title with [[Laurent Aiello]], Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported [[Joest Racing]] [[Audi A4|A4s]].

===Sports car racing===
Beginning in 1999, Audi built the [[Audi R8 Race Car|Audi R8]] to compete in [[sports car racing]], including the [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP900]] class at the [[24 hours of Le Mans]]. The factory supported Joest Racing team won at Le Mans three times in a row (2000 - 2002), as well as winning every race in the [[American Le Mans]] Series in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as [[Champion Racing]]. In 2003, two [[Bentley]] [[Bentley Speed 8|Speed 8]]s, with engines designed by Audi and driven by Joest drivers ''loaned'' to the fellow VW company, competed in the GTP class and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner's circle at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.

At the 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans, Champion Racing entered two R8s along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team [[Oreca]].  The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a more narrow air inlet restrictor, cutting power, and an additional 50 kg of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis.  On average, the R8s were about 2-3 seconds off pace compared to the [[Pescarolo]]-[[Judd]].  But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third while the ORECA team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GT's in 1967.  This also ends the long era of the R8, however its replacement for 2006, called the [[Audi R10]], was unveiled on December 13, 2005. the R10 employs many new features, including a twin-turbocharged diesel engine. Its first race will likely be the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring as a race-test for the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Technology==
Audi is the only car manufacturer that produces 100% [[galvanize]]d vehicles to prevent corrosion. Along with other precautionary measures, the thus achieved full-body [[zinc]] coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust and [[corrosion perforation]]. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year [[warranty]] against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years. An all-[[aluminium]] car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the Audi A8 was launched, which introduced aluminium [[space frame]] technology. Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-nineties and continues to pursue leading-edge technology and high performance.

The all-aluminium concept was extended to the company's new [[sub-compact]], the [[Audi A2]] which was launched in 2001.

In the 1970's, some vehicle manufacturers including Audi (and [[Subaru]]) designed their own [[all wheel drive]] systems in passenger vehicles. In the 1980's, all-wheel drive systems in cars became a fad, and other manufacturers like [[Porsche]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] offered all-wheel drive systems in their cars to compete in the marketplace. Unfortunately, the all-wheel drive system in the Mercedes-Benz vehicles were riddled with problems right from the design sheet. The system also was not popular in Porsche vehicles because owners wanted the traditional performance of the [[rear wheel drive]] they got used to in older Porsches. Although Porsche and Mercedes-Benz offer all-wheel drive systems in some cars today, neither manufacturer was able to ride the fad and come out on top like Audi has. Today, after many decades of class-leading technology and engineering, the name ''[[quattro]]'' is an identifiable symbol and trademark that shows would-be competitors the level of quality they have to achieve in order to attempt to compete with Audi.

In the 1980s, Audi was the champion of the inline 5 cylinder, [[Engine displacement|2.1/2.2 L]] engine as a longer lasting alternative to more traditional 6 cylinder engines. This engine was used in not only production cars but also their race cars. The 2.1 L inline 5 cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the 1980's, providing well over 400 [[horsepower]] (298 kW) after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity was a good combination of good fuel economy which was on the mind of every motorist in the 1980's, and a good amount of power the customer wants.
Through the early 1990's, Audi began to move more towards the position of being a real competitor in it's target market against Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorprated in the bonnet. 

By 1991, Audi had the 4 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 80]], the 5 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 90]] and [[Audi 100|Audi 100]], the turbocharged [[Audi 100|Audi 200]] and the [[Audi V8|Audi V8]]. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4 and 5 cylinder engines.

Although the five cylinder engine was a successful and very robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8l V6 engine. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines, in sedan, coupe and cabriolet body styles.

The 5 cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice, however a turbocharged 230BHP (169kW) version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the Sport Quattro. It was fitted to the Audi Coupe and named the S2 and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the [[Audi S4|S4]]. These two models were the beginning of the mass produced S series of performance cars.

The [[Audi A8|Audi A8]] replaced the [[Audi V8|V8]] in 1994, with a revolutionary Aluminium Space Frame (ASF) to save weight. The weight reduction was offset by the quattro all-wheel drive system, however it meant the car had similar performance to its rivals, but far superior handling.

The next major model change was in 1995 when the [[Audi A4|Audi A4]] replaced the [[Audi 80|Audi 80]]. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the Audi A6 (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the [[Audi S6|S6]] and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The [[Audi Cabriolet]] continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new [[Audi A3|A3]] (based on the [[VW Golf|Volkswagen Golf]]) was introduced to the range in 1997, and the radical [[Audi TT|TT]] coupe and roadster were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings. Another interesting model introduced was the [[Mercedes Benz|Mercedes-Benz]] A-Class competitor, the [[Audi A2|Audi A2]]. The model sold relatively well in Europe, however Audi decided not to develop a new model and it has since been discontinued as of 2004.

The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L 4 cylinder, 1.8 turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L V6, 2.2 L turbo-charged 5 cylinder and the 4.2 L V8. The V6's were replaced by new 2.4 and 2.8 L 30V V6's in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L W12 for the A8.

At the turn of the century, Audi introduced the [[direct shift gearbox]] (DSG), a manual transmission driveable like an automatic transmission. The system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled clutches instead of a [[torque converter]]. This is implemented in some [[Volkswagen Golf]], [[Audi A3]] and [[Audi TT|TT]] models. The engine range was continually upgraded, with a 2.7 L twin turbo V6 being offered in the Audi S4, A6 and allroad, the 2.8 L V6 was replaced by a 3.0 L unit.

New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the 1.8 L engine now 2.0 L and the 3.0 L V6 is now 3.1 L in size. Audi has now introduced [[FSI|FSI]] on some of their engines, including the 1.6 L 4 cylinder, a new 2.0 L (Audi was the first manufacturer in the world to utilize a turbo charger and FSI on the same powerplant), and the 3.1 L V6. This is a direct fuel-injection technique that Audi had also used on its diesel engines since the early 1980s.

As a premium member of the VW Group, technologies are frequently first introduced to the mass market with Audi vehicles before being 'trickled down' to more value oriented brands such as VW, [[SEAT]] and [[≈†koda Auto|≈†koda]]. Recent examples of this include DSG and FSI.

Audi now has an impressive range of cars, engines and transmissions available, which continue to lead the way and introduce new technologies into the market.

==Categories and classification==
Aircraft fall into two broad categories: 

===Heavier than air===
Heavier than air [[aerodyne]]s, including  [[autogyro]]s, [[helicopter]]s and variants, and conventional [[fixed-wing aircraft]] (airplanes or aeroplanes). Fixed-wing aircraft generally use an [[internal-combustion engine]] in the form of a [[piston engine]] (with a [[propeller]]) or a [[Turbine|turbine engine]] ([[Jet engine|jet]] or [[turboprop]]), to provide [[thrust]] that moves the craft forward through the air. The movement of air over the airfoil produces [[lift (force)|lift]] that causes the  aircraft to fly. Exceptions are [[glider]]s which have no engines and gain their thrust, initially, from [[winch]]es or tugs and then from gravity and thermal currents. For a glider to maintain its forward speed it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Helicopters and autogyros use a spinning rotor (a ''rotary wing'') to provide lift; helicopters also use the rotor to provide thrust. The abbreviation [[VTOL]] is applied to aircraft other than helicopters that can take off or land vertically. [[STOL]] stands for Short Take Off and Landing.

===Lighter than air===
[[image:yellow.balloon.takesoff.in.bath.arp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A hot air balloon takes off from Royal Victoria Park, Bath, England]]

[[Lighter than air]] [[aerostat]]s: [[hot air balloon]]s and [[airship]]s. Aerostats use [[buoyancy]] to float in the air in much the same manner as ships float on the water.  In particular, these aircraft use a relatively low density gas such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]] or heated air, to displace the air around the craft. The distinction between a balloon and an airship is that an airship has some means of controlling both its forward motion and steering itself, while balloons are carried along with the wind.

===Types of aircraft===
:''See also: [[List of aircraft]]''

There are several ways to classify aircraft. Below, we describe classifications by design, propulsion and usage.

====By design====
[[image:Size-comparison.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A size Comparation of some of the largest airplanes in the world. The Airbus A380-800, the Boeing 747-400 (largest airliner to date) The Antonov An-225 (aircraft with the greatest payload) and the Hughes H-4 &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; (largest airplane in the world) designed by the famous [[Howard Hughes]] ]]
A first division by design among aircraft is between lighter-than-air, '''aerostat''', and heavier-than-air aircraft, '''aerodyne'''.

Examples of lighter-than-air aircraft include non-steerable [[balloon]]s, such as [[hot air balloon]]s and [[gas balloon]]s, and steerable [[airship]]s (sometimes called dirigible balloons) such as [[blimp]]s (that have non-rigid construction) and [[rigid airship|rigid airships]] that have an internal frame. The most successful type of rigid airship was the [[Zeppelin]].  Several accidents,  such as the [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] fire at [[Lakehurst]], NJ, in [[1937]] led to the demise of large rigid airships.

In heavier-than-air aircraft, there are two ways to produce lift: aerodynamic lift and engine lift. In the case of aerodynamic lift, the aircraft is kept in the air by wings or rotors (see [[aerodynamics]]). With engine lift, the aircraft defeats gravity by use of [[vertical]] 
Examples of engine lift aircraft are [[rocket]]s, and [[VTOL]] aircraft such as the [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier]].

Among aerodynamically lifted aircraft, most fall in the category of [[fixed-wing aircraft]], where horizontal airfoils produce [[lift (force)|lift]], by profiting from airflow patterns determined by [[Bernoulli's equation]] and, to some extent, the [[Coanda effect]].

The forerunner of these type of aircraft is the [[Kite flying|kite]]. Kites depend upon the tension between the cord which anchors it to the ground and the force of the [[wind]] currents.  Much aerodynamic work was done with kites until test aircraft, wind tunnels and now computer modelling programs became available.  

In a &quot;conventional&quot; configuration, the lift surfaces are placed in front of a control surface or [[tailplane]]. The other configuration is the [[canard]] where small horizontal control surfaces are placed forward of the wings, near the nose of the aircraft. Canards are becoming more common as [[supersonic]] [[aerodynamic]]s grows more mature and because the forward surface contributes lift during straight-and-level flight.

The number of lift surfaces varied in the pre-[[1950]] period, as [[biplane]]s (two wings) and [[triplane]]s (three wings) were numerous in the early days of aviation. Subsequently most aircraft are [[monoplane]]s. This is principally an improvement in [[structure]]s and not aerodynamics.

Other possibilities include the [[delta-wing]], where lift and horizontal control surfaces are often combined, and the [[flying wing]], where there is no separate vertical control surface (e.g. the [[B-2 Spirit]]).

A variable geometry ('swing-wing') has also been employed in a few examples of combat aircraft (the [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]], [[Panavia Tornado]], [[F-14 Tomcat]] and [[B-1 Lancer]], among others).

The [[lifting body]] configuration is where the body itself produce lift. So far the only significant practical application of the lifting body is in the [[Space Shuttle]], but many aircraft generate lift from nothing other than wings alone.

A second category of aerodynamically lifted aircraft are the [[rotary-wing aircraft]]. Here, the lift is provided by rotating [[aerofoil]]s or [[rotor]]s. The best-known examples are the [[helicopter]], the [[autogyro]] and the [[tiltrotor]] aircraft (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]). Some craft have reaction-powered rotors with gas jets at the tips but most have one or more lift rotors powered from engine-driven shafts.

A further category might encompass the [[ground effect|wing-in-ground-effect]] types, for example the Russian [[ekranoplan]] also nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot; and [[hovercraft]]; most of the latter employing a skirt and achieving limited ground or water clearance to reduce friction and achieve speeds above those achieved by [[boat]]s of similar weight.

A recent innovation is a completely new class of aircraft, the [[fan wing]]. This uses a fixed wing with a forced airflow produced by cylindrical fans mounted above. It is (2005) in development in the [[United Kingdom]].

And finally the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]] is a category of its own. These designs may have potential but are not yet practical.

====By propulsion====
[[Image:WestCoastAirFloatplane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHavilland Twin Otter]] adapted as a [[floatplane]].]]
Some types of aircraft, such as the balloon or [[glider]], do not have any propulsion. Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude).  For gliders, takeoff takes place from a high location, or the aircraft is pulled into the air by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or towed aloft by a powered &quot;tug&quot; aircraft.  [[Airship]]s combine a balloon's [[buoyancy]] with some kind of propulsion, usually [[propeller]] driven.

Until [[World War II]], the [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] was virtually the only type of propulsion used for powered aircraft. (See also: [[Aircraft engine]].)  The piston engine is still used in the majority of aircraft produced, since it is efficient at the lower altitudes used by small aircraft, but the [[radial engine]] (with the cylinders arranged in a circle around the [[crankshaft]]) has largely given way to the [[horizontally-opposed engine]] (with the cylinders lined up on two sides of the crankshaft).  Water cooled [[V engine]]s, as used in automobiles, were common in high speed aircraft, until they were replaced by jet and turbine power.  Piston engines typically operate using [[avgas]] or regular gasoline, though some new ones are being designed to operate on diesel or jet fuel.  Piston engines normally become less efficient above 7,000-8,000 ft (2100-2400 m) above sea level because there is less oxygen available for combustion; to solve that problem, some piston engines have mechanically powered compressors (blowers) or turbine-powered [[turbocharger]]s or turbonormalizers that compress the air before feeding it into the engine; these piston engines can often operate efficiently at 20,000 ft (6100 m) above sea level or higher, altitudes that require the use of supplemental oxygen or cabin pressurisation. 
During the forties and especially following the [[1973 energy crisis]], development work was done on propellers with swept tips or even scimitar-shaped blades for use in high-speed commercial and military transports.

Pressurised aircraft, however, are more likely to use the [[turbine|turbine engine]], since it is naturally efficient at higher altitudes and can operate above 40,000 ft. Helicopters also typically use turbine engines.  In addition to turbine engines like the [[turboprop]] and [[jet engine|turbojet]], other types of high-altitude, high-performance engines have included the [[ramjet]] and the [[pulse jet]].  [[Rocket aircraft]] have occasionally been experimented with. They are restricted to rather specialised niches, such as [[spaceflight]], where no oxygen is available for combustion (rockets carry their own oxygen).

====By usage====
The major distinction in aircraft usage is between [[military aviation]], which includes all uses of aircraft for military purposes (such as combat, patrolling, search and rescue, reconnaissance, transport, and training), and [[civil aviation]], which includes all uses of aircraft for non-military purposes.  

=====[[Military aircraft]]=====
[[Image:4781.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A prototype of [[Hindustan Aeronautics]]' [[Light Combat Aircraft]].]]
Combat aircraft like fighters or bombers represent only a minority of the category.  Many civil aircraft have been produced in separate models for military use, such as the civil [[Douglas DC-3]] airliner, which became the military [[C-47]]/C-53/R4D transport in the U.S. military and the &quot;Dakota&quot; in the U.K. and the [[Commonwealth]].  Even the small fabric-covered two-seater [[Piper Cub|Piper J3 Cub]] had a military version, the L-4 liaison, observation and trainer aircraft.  In the past, gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and cargo gliders were used during [[World War II]] to land intruding German troops in a few European countries in the 1940-42 period, while Allied troops used them in landings on [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]], 1943, and in Western Europe [France and Holland] on [[D-Day]] (the [[Normandy]] 6 June 1944 [[Operation Overlord]] invasion) and in [[Operation Anvil-Dragoon]] (1944) and in [[Operation Market Garden]] (1944).  

Combat aircraft themselves, though used a handful of times for reconnaissance and [[surveillance aircraft|surveillance]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]], did not come into widespread use until the [[Balkan War]] when [[first air-dropped bomb]] was invented and widely used by [[Bulgarian air force]] against [[Turkey]]. During [[World War I]] many types of aircraft were adapted for attacking the ground or enemy vehicles/ships/guns/aircraft, and the first aircraft designed as [[bomber]]s were born. In order to prevent the enemy from bombing, [[fighter aircraft]] were developed to intercept and shoot down enemy aircraft. [[Tanker (aircraft)|Tanker]]s were developed after [[World War II]] to refuel other aircraft in mid-air, thus increasing their operational range.  By the time of the [[Vietnam War]], [[helicopter]]s had come into widespread military use, especially for transporting, supplying, and supporting ground troops.

=====Civil aviation=====
[[image:heli.g-code.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bell 206|Bell 206B JetRanger III]] '''[[helicopter]]''']]
Civil aviation includes both scheduled airline flights and [[general aviation]], a catch-all covering other kinds of private and commercial use.  The vast majority of flights flown around the world each day belong to the general aviation category, ranging from recreational balloon flying to civilian flight training to business trips to firefighting to medevac flights to cargo transportation on [[freight aircraft]].

Within general aviation, the major distinction is between private flights (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial flights (where the pilot is paid by a customer or employer).  Private pilots use aircraft primarily for personal travel, business travel, or recreation. Usually these private pilots own their own aircraft and take out loans from banks or specialized lenders to purchase them. Commercial general aviation pilots use aircraft for a wide range of tasks, such as flight training, pipeline surveying, passenger and freight transport, policing, crop dusting, and medical transport ([[medevac]]). Piston-powered propeller aircraft (single-engine or twin-engine) are especially common for both private and commercial general aviation, but even private pilots occasionally own and operate helicopters like the [[Bell 206|Bell JetRanger]] or turboprops like the [[Beechcraft King Air]]. Business jets are typically flown by commercial pilots, although there is a new generation of small jets arriving soon for private pilots.

'''Aphex Twin''' (born '''Richard David James''', [[August 18]], [[1971]], [[Ireland]]) is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[electronic music]] artist, credited with pushing forward the genres of [[techno music|techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]],  [[Acid (electronic music)|acid]], and [[drum and bass]]. He has been described as &quot;the most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music&quot; ([http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html]).

==Biography==
Richard David James was born to [[Wales|Welsh]] parents Lorna and Derek James in [[1971]] in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. James spent his childhood in [[Cornwall, United Kingdom]]. As a teenager, he became a [[DJ]] and [[musician]] on the local [[rave party|rave]] scene, taking on the [[moniker]] &quot;Aphex Twin&quot;. James formed the [[Rephlex Records]] label in [[1991]] with his friend [[Grant Wilson-Claridge]] and released his first records on this label, as well as [[Mighty Force]] and [[R&amp;S Records]] of [[Belgium]]. After success with his early work, James relocated to [[London]] and released a slew of albums and [[EP (format)|EPs]] on the [[Warp Records]] label, under a bewildering set of aliases (from AFX and Polygon Window to the lesser known Gak and Power Pill). 

In [[1996]], he began releasing more material composed on computers, and embraced a more [[drum and bass]] sound mixed with a nostalgic childhood theme and strange computer generated acid lines. The early adoption of [[Native Instruments]]' softsynthesizers predated the later popularity of using computers to make music. The late 1990s saw his music become more popular and mainstream, as he released two singles, &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, which were shown on [[MTV]] and the covers of music magazines including [[NME]]. 

[[Image:Aphex Twin logo.png|frame|right|The Aphex Twin Logo, present on most Aphex Twin/AFX releases.]]

In [[2001]] Aphex Twin released his most personal album yet, ''[[drukqs]]'', a 2-CD album which featured [[prepared piano]] songs under the influence of [[Erik Satie]] and [[John Cage]]. Also included were abrasive, fast, and meticulously programmed computer-made songs. The level of detail and artistry was so high, that reviewers and fans complained that the music was less in the style of innovative pop music, and more about detailed beautiful and personal musical art.  ''[[drukqs]]'' is perhaps Richard's most controversial album to date; the album lacked the novelty found in his other albums, so reviewers guessed this album was released as a contract breaker with Warp Records - a credible guess, as James' next big release came out on his own Rephlex label. It is also rumored that the album drukqs was released as it was because he had almost all of these songs on a creative jukebox that he forgot and left on a plane, and in fear of all of the tracks being leaked to the internet, its release was rushed as to avoid this.

In late 2004, rumours of James' return to a more [[acid techno]] based sound were realised with the ''[[Analord]]'' series. For these records, James used his extensive collection of [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[drum machine]]s which he bought when they were still at bargain prices. Also he used one of the rarest, and most desirable [[synthesizer]]s of his generation, the [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/syntonfenix883.htm Synton Fenix], and the notoriously difficult to program [[Roland MC-4]] [[sequencer]] (a sequencer with a reputation for excellent timing), as well as the infamous [[Roland TB-303]] for his trademark acid melodies.

Apart from music, Richard D. James is a talented [[photography|photographer]], having done his own artwork direction for many of his albums. On the &quot;Windowlicker&quot; single, James hid a picture of his face (created most likely with [http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.html Metasynth]) in the second track (commonly referred to as &quot;[Formula]&quot;, &quot;[Symbol]&quot;, or &quot;[Equation]&quot;), which can be seen in a [http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,52426,00.html spectral] [http://www.bastwood.com/aphex.php analysis] of the track. The picture illustrates his famous toothy, evil grin.

===Aphex Twin's influences===

James has stated in numerous interviews that he has no musical influences other than himself. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html] He claims to have listened rarely to songs on the [[radio]] as a child and that he is unable to read [[Musical notation|sheet music]].

Conversely, James has said that he has listened to many bands and artists for inspiration and sampling (notably [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] for their [[Break (music)|breaks]] (used as break beats), but he has also expressed appreciation for [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]). He signed fellow musicans and personal friends Tom &quot;[[Squarepusher]]&quot; Jenkinson and Mike Paradinas ([[¬µ-ziq]]) to his [[Rephlex Records|Rephlex]] record label, as well as [[Luke Vibert]].

Other debated influences include:

&lt;!--Please keep list alphabetical--&gt;
* [[808 State]] for whom he has done remix work.
* [[John Cage]] and his [[prepared piano]] technique (itself inspired by [[Henry Cowell]] and [[Erik Satie]] independently) in the piano pieces on ''Drukqs''
* [[Coil (band)|Coil]]
* [[Tod Dockstader]] An electronic musician who worked with tape, mangling sounds into music of the frequency and dynamics spectrum.
* [[Mike Dred]]  Acid Techno pioneer and [[Techno]] [[Electroacoustic]] hybrid pioneer (together with Peter Green) on Dred's &quot;Machine Codes&quot; label.  James is quoted as saying that he listened to Dred &amp; Green's ''Virtual Farmer'' LP 21 times in a row when he first heard it.
* [[Brian Eno]] pioneer of ambient music, and for the artwork of his ambient records.
* [[Larry Heard]] (One song on ''Analord 02'' is called Laricheard, an obvious [[pun]] on the names Larry Heard and Richard, as the song resembles Mr. Fingers/Larry Heard track &quot;Amnesia&quot;.)
* [[Kraftwerk]] and their electropop styles.
* Kevin 'Master Reese' Saunderson
* [[Derrick May]] Techno pioneer.
* [[Joe Meek]], especially ''I Heard A New World'' album of this pioneering 1960s UK producer.
* [[Erik Satie]] whose melodic style was borrowed on ''Drukqs''.
* [[Squarepusher]] and [[Luke Vibert]] for their extreme versions of drum and bass.

===Influence of Aphex Twin on others===
Fans and journalists coined the genre names [[intelligent dance music|IDM]] and [[drill and bass]] to describe Aphex Twin's novel approach to dance music. Richard's own Rephlex Records label, which he co-owns with [[Grant Wilson-Claridge]] prefers the term &quot;Braindance&quot;.

These labels have proven useful for upcoming artists looking to find a genre name for their own music, influenced by Aphex Twin and Warp Records. In Aphex Twin's words on the 'Intelligent Dance Music' label: &quot;I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don't use names. I just say that I like something or I don't.&quot;

Aphex Twin tends to distance himself from rock/pop music, yet he has still had an influence on the rock bands like  [[Radiohead]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Peace Burial at Sea]]. Aphex Twin dismissed going on tour with Radiohead: &quot;I wouldn't play with them since I don't like them.&quot;[http://www.kludgemagazine.com/interviews.php?id=82]

==Aphex Twin's press==
Aphex Twin press interviews are generally entertaining, eccentric, and confusing. 

Aphex Twin has a reputation for lying in interviews, which he has [http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html admitted] to the Guardian newspaper. It is now been confirmed that Richard does own a tank (actually a 1950s armoured scout car, the [[Daimler]] Ferret Mark 3), a [[submarine]] bought from Russia, composing ambient techno at age 13 (contradicting most music history), having &quot;over 100 hours&quot; of unreleased music (including songs on his [[answering machine]] that could be wiped away by leaving a message), being able to incorporate [[lucid dreaming]] into the process of making music.
He lives in a converted bank in SE16 London, which was formerly the Bank of Cyprus and then HSBC.

It has now been confirmed by Richard`s close friends that he has built his own synthesizers and samplers from scratch in his early years. Richard once built a sampler box for his degree in microelectronics, and a photograph and article of it was taken for a UK electronic music magazine Future music. Richard is experienced in electronics and electricity, and has modified and [[circuit bending|circuit bent]] his equipment from a young age.

He has made his own software to compose with, including algorithmic processes which automatically generate beats and melodies.

{{Audio|sv-Alfred_Nobel.ogg|'''Alfred Bernhard Nobel'''}} ([[October 21]], [[1833]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] &amp;ndash; [[December 10]], [[1896]], [[San Remo, Italy]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]]  chemist, engineer, pacifist, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the [[inventor]] of [[dynamite]]. He owned [[Bofors]], a major armaments manufacturer, that he had redirected from its previous role as an iron and steel mill. In his last will, he used his enormous fortune to institute the [[Nobel Prize]]s. The [[synthetic element]] [[Nobelium]] was named after him.

==Personal background==
Alfred Nobel, a descendant of the 17th century scientist, [[Olaus Rudbeck]] (1630-1702), was the third son of [[Immanuel Nobel]] (1801-1872). Born in [[Stockholm]], he went with his family at an early age to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], where his father (who had invented modern [[plywood]]) started a [[naval mine|&quot;torpedo&quot;]] works. In 1859 this was left to the care of the second son, [[Ludvig Nobel|Ludvig Emmanuel]] (1831-1888), by whom it was greatly enlarged, and Alfred, returning to Sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business, devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerine]] (discovered in 1847 by [[Ascanio Sobrero]], one of his  fellow-students under [[Th√©ophile-Jules Pelouze]] at the [[University of Torino]]). Several explosions were reported at their family-owned factory in [[Heleneborg, Sweden|Heleneborg]], and a disastrous one in 1864 killed Alfred's younger brother Emil and several other workers.

Less well known is that Alfred Nobel was also a playwright. His only play, ''[[Nemesis (Nobel)|Nemesis]]'', a prose tragedy in four acts about [[Beatrice Cenci]], partly inspired by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s blank verse tragedy in five acts [[The Cenci]], was printed when he was dying, and the whole stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish-[[Esperanto]]) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has not yet (May 2003) been translated into any language other than Esperanto. 

Alfred Nobel is buried in the [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

== Dynamite ==
Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like [[diatomaceous earth|kieselguhr]] (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to manipulate, and this mixture he [[patent]]ed in 1867 as [[dynamite]]. 

He next combined nitroglycerin with another high explosive, [[gun-cotton]], and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a still more powerful explosive than dynamite. [[Gelignite|Blasting gelatin]], as it was called, was patented in 1876, and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of [[potassium nitrate]], wood-pulp and various other substances. 

Some years later Nobel produced [[ballistite]], one of the earliest of the nitroglycerin [[smokeless gunpowder]]s, containing in its latest forms about equal parts of gun-cotton and nitroglycerin. This powder was a precursor of [[cordite]], and Nobel's claim that his patent covered the latter was the occasion of vigorously contested law-suits between him and the [[United Kingdom|British]] Government in 1894 and 1895. Cordite also consists of nitroglycerin and gun-cotton, but the form of the latter which its inventors wished to use was the most highly nitrated variety, which is not soluble in mixtures of [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]], whereas Nobel contemplated using a less nitrated form, which is soluble in such mixtures. The question was complicated by the fact that it is in practice impossible to prepare either of these two forms without admixture of the other; eventually the courts decided against Nobel. Cordite became a mainstay munition of the British empire throughout the late 19th and early 20th century.

From the manufacture of dynamite and other explosives, and from the exploitation of the [[Baky|Baku]] oil-fields, in the development of which he and his brothers, Ludvig and Robert Hjalmar (1829-1896), took a leading part, he amassed an immense fortune.

==Armaments Manufacturer==
A less well remembered aspect of his life was his role in setting up a major armaments manufacturer, [[Bofors]] Defence AB. He was Bofors most famous owner, and owned the company from 1894 until his death in December of 1896. He had the key role in reshaping this iron manufacturer to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry.

Bofors went on to become a major supplier of howitzers, cannons and field guns to armies around the world, including the USA and many Third-World dictatorships.

== The Prizes ==

The erroneous publication in 1888 of a [[List of premature obituaries|premature obituary]] of Nobel by a French newspaper, condemning his invention of dynamite, is said to have made him decide to leave a better legacy to the world after his death.

On [[November 27]], [[1895]] at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in [[Paris]], Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a [[stroke]] on [[December 10]], [[1896]] at [[San Remo]], [[Italy]].  The amount set aside for the Nobel Prize foundation was 31 million kronor.

The first three of these prizes are for eminence in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physical science]], in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]] and in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|medical science or physiology]]; the fourth is for the most remarkable [[Nobel Prize for Literature|literary work]] &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and [[Nobel Peace Prize|the fifth]] is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international brother/sisterhood, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of [[peace]] congresses.

The formulation about the literary prize, &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (Swedish ''i idealisk riktning''), is cryptic and has caused much consternation. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (in Swedish ''idealistisk''), and used it as a pretext to not give the prize to important but less [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has been revised, and the prize given to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[Jos√© Saramago]], who definitely do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

When reading ''Nemesis'' in its original Swedish and looking at his own philosophical and literary standpoint, it seems possible that his intention might have been rather the opposite of that first believed - that the prize should be given to authors who fight for their ideals ''against'' such authorities as God, Church and State.

There was also quite a lot of room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament he stipulated that the money should go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but he had not left instructions on how to do the split between science and technology.  Since the deciding bodies he had chosen in these domains were more concerned with science than technology it is not surprising that the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers, technicians or other inventors.  In a sense the technological prizes announced recently by the [[World Technology Network]] are an indirect (and thus not funded by the Nobel foundation) continuation of the wishes of Nobel, as he set them out in his testament.

In 2001, his great-grandnephew, Peter, asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards.  This has caused much controversy whether the prize for [[Economics]] is actually a &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; (see [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]).

==Nobel Prize rumors==
* There is no Nobel Prize for mathematics. A common legend states that Nobel decided against a prize in mathematics because a woman he proposed to (or his wife, or his mistress) rejected him or cheated on him with a famous mathematician, often claimed to be [[G√∂sta Mittag-Leffler]]. There is no historical evidence to support the story, and Nobel was never married.

'''Alexander Graham Bell''' ([[March 3]], [[1847]] &amp;ndash; [[August 2]], [[1922]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]]-[[United States|American]] [[scientist]] and [[inventor]].  Today, he is still widely considered to be the inventor of the [[telephone]], although this matter has become [[Invention of the telephone#Controversy|controversial]], with a number of people claiming that [[Antonio Meucci]] was the 'real' inventor and others holding out for [[Elisha Gray]], the founder of the [[Western Electric]] Manufacturing Company. In addition to his work in [[telecommunications]] technology, he was responsible for important advances in [[aviation]] and [[hydrofoil]] technology.

==Biography==
Born '''Alexander Bell''' in [[Edinburgh]], he later adopted the middle name ''Graham'' out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a family friend.  Many called him &quot;the father of the Deaf.&quot;  This title is somewhat ironic due to his belief in the practice of Eugenics.  He hoped to one day eradicate deafness from the population.

His family was associated with the teaching of [[elocution]]: his grandfather in [[London]], his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, [[Alexander Melville Bell]], in Edinburgh, were all professed elocutionists. The latter has published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are well known, especially his treatise on [[Visible Speech]], which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. In this he explains his method of instructing [[deaf mutes]], by means of their [[eyesight]], how to articulate words, and also how to read what other persons are saying by the motions of their [[lip]]s.

Alexander Graham Bell was educated at the [[Royal High School]] of Edinburgh, from which he graduated at the age of 13. At the age of 16 he secured a position as a pupil-teacher of elocution and music in [[Weston House Academy]], at [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], [[Moray]], Scotland. The next year he spent at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  He was graduated from University College London.

From 1866 to 1867, he was an instructor at [[Somersetshire College]] at [[Bath, England|Bath]], [[Somerset]], [[England]].

While still in Scotland he is said to have turned his attention to the science of [[acoustics]], with a view to ameliorate the deafness of his mother.

In 1870, at the age of 23, he [[emigrated]] with his family to [[Canada]] where they settled at [[Brantford]]. Before he left Scotland, Bell had turned his attention to [[telephony]], and in Canada he continued an interest in communication machines. He designed a piano which could transmit its music to a distance by means of electricity. In 1873, he accompanied his father to [[Montreal]], Canada, where he was employed in teaching the system of visible speech. The elder Bell was invited to introduce the system into a large day-school for mutes at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], but he declined the post in favor of his son, who became Professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at [[Boston University]]'s School of Oratory. 

[[Image:1876 Bell Speaking into Telephone.jpg|thumb|Bell speaking into prototype model of the telephone]]
At [[Boston University]] he continued his research in the same field, and endeavored to produce a telephone which would not only send musical notes, but articulate speech. With financing from his American father-in-law, on [[March 7]], [[1876]], the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] granted him [[Patent]] Number 174,465 covering &quot;the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound&quot;, the [[telephone]].

After obtaining the patent for the telephone, Bell continued his many experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone-transmission of sound on a beam of [[light]] &amp;mdash; a precursor of today's [[fiber optics|optical fiber]] systems. He also worked in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the eighteen patents granted in his name alone and the twelve he shared with his collaborators. These included fourteen for the telephone and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], four for the [[photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for hydroairplanes, and two for a [[selenium]] cell.

Bell had many great ideas that are now real inventions.  During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record, as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they were unable to develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the computer, and the CD-ROM. 

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his [[Canada|Canadian]] estate in [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]], [[Nova Scotia]], he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses. 

In 1882, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In 1888, he was one of the founding members of the [[National Geographic Society]] and became its second president. He was the recipient of many honors. The [[France|French Government]] conferred on him the decoration of the [[L√©gion d'honneur]] (Legion of Honor), the [[Acad√©mie fran√ßaise]] bestowed on him the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 francs, the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London awarded him the [[Albert medal]] in 1902, and the University of [[W√ºrzburg]], [[Bavaria]], granted him a Ph.D. He was awarded the [[AIEE]]'s [[Edison Medal]] in 1914 for &quot;For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone.&quot;

Bell married Mabel Hubbard, who was one of his pupils at Boston University, as well as a deaf-mute, on [[July 11]], [[1877]]. His invention of the telephone was actually a device he was trying to create that would allow him to communicate with his wife and his deaf mother. He died at Beinn Bhreagh, located on [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Cape Breton Island]] near the village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]], in 1922 and is buried alongside his wife atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. He was survived by two of their four children.

Bell was listed among the [[100 Greatest Britons]], [[The Greatest American|the 100 Greatest Americans]] and in the top ten [[The Greatest Canadian|Greatest Canadians]], the only person to be on more than one list. 

====Bell and decibel====
The ''bel'' (B) is a unit of measurement invented by [[Bell Labs]] and named after Bell. The bel was too large for everyday use, so the [[decibel]] (dB), equal to 0.1 B, became more commonly used.
The dB is commonly used as a unit for measuring sound intensity.

===The photophone===
Another of Bell's inventions was the [[photophone]], a device enabling the transmission of sound over a beam of light, which he developed together with [[Charles Sumner Tainter]]. The device employed light-sensitive cells of crystalline [[selenium]], which has the property that its [[electrical resistance]] varies inversely with the illumination (i.e., the resistance is higher when the material is in the dark, and lower when it is lighted). The basic principle was to modulate a beam of light directed at a receiver made of crystalline selenium, to which a [[telephone]] was attached. The modulation was done either by means of a vibrating mirror, or a rotating disk periodically obscuring the light beam.

This idea was by no means new. Selenium had been discovered by [[J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius]] in 1817, and the peculiar properties of crystalline or granulate selenium were discovered by [[Willoughby Smith]] in 1873. In 1878, one writer with the initials J.F.W. from [[Kew]] described such an arrangement in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in a column appearing on [[June 13]], asking the readers whether any experiments in that direction had already been done. In his paper on the photophone, Bell credited one [[A. C. Browne]] of [[London]] with the independent discovery in 1878&amp;mdash;the same year Bell became aware of the idea. Bell and Tainter, however, were apparently the first to perform a successful experiment, by no means any easy task, as they even had to produce the selenium cells with the desired resistance characteristics themselves.

In one experiment in [[Washington, D.C.]] the sender and the receiver were placed on different buildings some 700 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] (213 [[metre]]s) apart. The sender consisted of a mirror directing sunlight onto the mouthpiece, where the light beam was modulated by a vibrating mirror, focused by a [[optical device|lens]] and directed at the receiver, which was simply a [[parabolic]] reflector with the selenium cells in the [[focus]] and the telephone attached. With this setup, Bell and Tainter succeeded to communicate clearly.

The photophone was [[patent]]ed on [[December 18]] [[1880]], but the quality of communication remained poor and the research was not pursued by Bell.

===Metal detector===
Bell is also credited with the invention of the [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was hurriedly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Garfield]]. The metal detector worked, but didn't find the bullet because the metal bedframe the President was lying on confused the instrument. Bell gave a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in August 1882.  Though unsuccessful in its first incarnation, this achievement would eventually change the nature of physical security.

===Experimental aircraft===
Bell was also interested in [[aircraft]] and was a supporter of [[aerospace engineering]] research through the [[Aerial Experiment Association]]. The Association was officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia in October 1907 at the suggestion of Mrs. Mabel Bell and with her financial support. It was headed by the inventor himself. The founding members were four young men, American [[Glenn Curtiss|Glenn H. Curtiss]], a motorcycle manufacturer who would later be awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere and later be world-renowned as an airplane manufacturer; [[Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin]], the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in [[Hammondsport, New York]]; J.A.D. McCurdy; and Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]], an official observer of the U.S. government. One of the project's inventions, the [[aileron]], is a standard component of aircraft today. (Note that the aileron was also invented independently by [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]].)

In 1909, Bell's ''[[Silver Dart]]'' made the first controlled powered flight in Canada. However, a series of Canadian flights failed to interest the Canadian military in developing the airplane.

===The hydrofoil===
The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American [[hydrofoil]] pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils. Bell considered the invention of the [[Hydrofoil|hydroplane]] as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat.

Bell and Casey Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910&amp;ndash;1911 Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck a number of designs were tried culminating in the HD-4, using Renault engines.  A top speed of 54 miles per hour was achieved, with rapid acceleration, good stability and steering, and the ability to take waves without difficulty. 
Bell's report to the navy permitted him to obtain two 350 [[horsepower]] (260 [[Watt|kW]]) engines in July 1919. On [[September 9]] [[1919]] the HD-4 set a world's marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour. This record stood for ten years.

==Eugenics==
Along with many very prominent thinkers and scientists of the time, Bell was connected with the [[eugenics]] movement in the United States. From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisors to the [[Eugenics Record Office]] associated with [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in [[New York]], and regularly attended meetings. In 1921 he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organizations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a &quot;defective variety of the human race&quot;. 

Much of his thoughts about people he considered defective centered on the deaf because of his long contact with them in relation to his work in [[deaf education]]. In addition to advocating sterilization of the deaf, Bell wished to prohibit deaf teachers from being allowed to teach in schools for the deaf, he worked to  outlaw the marriage of deaf individuals to one another, and he was an ardent supporter of [[oralism]] over [[manualism]]. His avowed goal was to eradicate the language and culture of the deaf so as to force them to integrate into the hearing culture for their own long-term benefit and for the benefit of society at large. Although this attitude is widely seen as paternalistic and arrogant today, it was accepted in that era.

Although he supported what many would consider harsh and inhumane policies today, he was not unkind to deaf individuals who proved his theories of oralism. He was a personal and longtime friend of [[Helen Keller]], and his wife Mabel was deaf, though none of their children were. Bell was well known as a kindly father and loving family man who took great pleasure playing with his many grandchildren.

== Tribute ==

In the early 1970s, UK Rock Group [[The Sweet]] recorded a tribute to Bell and the telephone, suitably titled &quot;Alexander Graham Bell&quot;. The song tells a fictional account of the invention, in which Bell devises the telephone so he can talk to his girlfriend who lives on the other side of the United States from him. The song reached the top 40 in the UK and went on to sell over one million recordings world-wide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'''''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[national anthem]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Although usually sung in the [[Irish language]], a translation of the original, it is also known by the English-language title, '''''A Soldier's Song''''', as well as '''The National Anthem of Ireland''' ('''Amhr√°n N√°isi√∫nta na h√âireann'''). The lyrics of the song are by [[Peadar Kearney]] and the music by both Kearney and [[Patrick Heeney]]. It was composed in [[1907]] and was first published in ''[[Irish Freedom]]'' in [[1912]]. The [[Irish language]] version of the original was the work of [[Bulmer Hobson]]. 

The song is regarded by many [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] as the national anthem of the whole of [[Ireland]], and it is therefore sung, for example, at [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] matches held anywhere on the island. [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]]s, however, reject this use of ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'', and at international games played by the all-Ireland [[Ireland national rugby union team|Irish Rugby Football Union]] team the song ''[[Ireland's Call]]'' is sung instead of, or (in the [[Republic of Ireland]]) as well as, ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann''.

==History==
''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'' was relatively unknown until it was sung by rebels in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) during the [[Easter Rising]] of [[1916]], and afterwards in British internment camps. The song became the official state anthem in [[1926]] when it replaced the unofficial anthem, ''[[God Save Ireland]]''. 

''[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]'' was the official anthem of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] until the independent [[Irish Free State]] was established in [[1922]]. The continued use of ''God Save the King'' by some Irish people caused embarrassment to the new Irish state and, on one famous occasion, [[James McNeill|Governor-General James McNeill]] refused to attend a public function in [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] when he discovered that the university intended playing the anthem during his visit. Even after the adoption of ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'' as the official anthem of the Irish Free State in July [[1926]], a minority continued to sing the British anthem, and to pray for the King and Queen in religious ceremonies, for a number of years.

In [[1934]], the Irish state acquired the copyright of the song for the sum of ¬£1,200.[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/gen121934a.html] 

Controversy also surrounds the change in the wording of ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'' over the years. In the original translation, the first line read as ''Sinne Laochra Gaedheal'' (literally &quot;we the heroes of Ireland&quot;). This has since been replaced by ''Sinne Fianna F√°il'', which to some people is evidence that the anthem has been hijacked by the [[Fianna F√°il]] party.[http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/letters/2005/1101/]

In recent years, a number of Irish newspapers and columnists have proposed replacing ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'' with a new national anthem, arguing that the current wording is excessively militant and anti-[[United Kingdom|British]]. Others have argued that the melody is difficult for bands to play. Problems have sometimes been witnessed at international sporting events, where either the entire song (not just the chorus that constitutes the anthem) has been played (as occurred, for example, at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]]) or the right part has been played but at the wrong speed, as occurred at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]] in [[2000]]. 

Some have proposed that the anthem be replaced with the Irish Rugby Football Union's song, ''Ireland's Call''. The suggestion has also been made that, as occurred in [[Germany]] after [[World War II]], the government might change the words of the anthem while keeping the original melody.

==Lyrics==
The Irish national anthem consists of the chorus only of ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'', and is almost always sung in Irish. The first two lines of the anthem and the last two, played together, form the Irish ''Presidential Salute'', which is played when the [[President of Ireland]] attends official events. The chorus of ''Amhr√°n na bhFiann'', as used for the anthem, is given below.

===Irish version===
:Sinne Fianna F√°il
:At√° faoi gheall ag √âirinn,
:Bu√≠on d√°r slua
:Thar toinn do r√°inig chughainn,
:Faoi mh√≥id bheith saor.
:Sean-t√≠r √°r sinsear feasta
:N√≠ fh√°gfar faoin tior√°n n√° faoin tr√°ill
:Anocht a th√©am sa bhearna baoil,
:Le gean ar Ghaeil chun b√°is n√≥ saoil
:Le gunna scr√©ach faoi l√°mhach na bpil√©ar
:Seo libh canaig Amhr√°n na bhFiann.

===Phonetic version===
:shin-na fee-in-na fall
:a-thaw fay yeol egg erin
:bween dar slew
:harr thin the raw ne gooin
:Fway vawid veh sair
:shawn-tier awr shinshir fasta
:nee-owg fur fay teer-awn naw feign trawl
:an nocht a hame saw varna vwail
:lay gown owr gwale cunn boss no sale
:le gunna sh-rake fay law buck naw bell air
:shull liv con-ig arawn naveen

===English version===
:Soldiers are we
:whose lives are pledged to Ireland;
:Some have come
:from a land beyond the wave.
:Sworn to be free,
:No more our ancient sireland
:Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
:Tonight we man the ''bearna baoil'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:In Erin's cause, come woe or weal;
:'Mid cannon's roar and rifles' peal,
:We'll chant a soldier's song.

:We'll sing a song, a soldier's song,
:With cheering rousing chorus,
:As round our blazing fires we throng,

:Chorus:
:Soldiers are we
:whose lives are pledged to Ireland;

:Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
:Tonight we man the gap of danger
:In Erin's cause, come woe or weal
:'Mid cannons' roar and rifles peal,
:We'll chant a soldier's song. 

:In valley green, on towering crag,
:Our fathers fought before us,
:And conquered 'neath the same old flag
:That's proudly floating o'er us.
:We're children of a fighting race,
:That never yet has known disgrace,
:And as we march, the foe to face,
:We'll chant a soldier's song. 

:Chorus 

:Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale!
:The long watched day is breaking;
:The serried ranks of Inisfail
:Shall set the Tyrant quaking.
:Our camp fires now are burning low;
:See in the east a silv'ry glow,
:Out yonder waits the Saxon foe,
:So chant a soldier's song. 

:Chorus

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anatolia composite NASA.png|thumb|200px|right|Asia Minor lies east of the [[Bosporus]], between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.]]

'''Anatolia''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: &quot;Anadolu&quot;,[[Greek language|Greek]]: &quot;AŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒÆ&quot; ''Œënatolƒì'' or ŒëŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒØŒ± ''Anatol√¨a'') is a region of [[Southwest Asia]] which corresponds today to the [[Asia]]n portion of [[Turkey]], as opposed to the [[Europe]]an portion, [[Rumelia]]. It means &quot;rising of the sun&quot; or &quot;East&quot;. The Turkish word '''Anadolu''' derives from the original Greek version.  It also often called by the [[Latin]] name of '''Asia Minor'''.
 
Because of its strategic location at the intersection of Asia and [[Europe]], Anatolia has been a cradle for several [[civilization]]s since [[prehistoric]] ages, with [[Neolithic]]  settlements such as [[√áatalh√∂y√ºk]] (Pottery Neolithic), [[√áay√∂n√º]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] to pottery Neolithic), [[Nevali Cori]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]), [[Hacilar]] (Pottery Neolithic), [[G√∂bekli Tepe]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]) and [[Mersin]]. The settlement of [[Troy]] starts in the Neolithic and continues forward into the Iron Age.
Major civilizations and peoples that have settled in or conquered Anatolia include the [[Colchians]], [[Hattians]], [[Luwian]]s, [[Hittites]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Cimmerian]]s, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Persians]], [[Celt]]s, [[Tabal]]s, [[Meshech]]s, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Pelasgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Goths]], [[Kurds]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Seljuk Turks]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. These peoples belonged to many varied [[ethnic]] and [[linguistic]] traditions. Through recorded history, Anatolians have spoken both [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] languages, as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages have radiated. Other authors have proposed an Anatolian origin for the [[Etruscans]] of ancient [[Italy]].
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Asia Minor Ancient Map.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Asia Minor in Antiquity]] --&gt;
Today the inhabitants of Anatolia are mostly native speakers of the [[Turkish language]], which was introduced with the conquest of Anatolia by [[Turkic peoples]] and the rise of the [[Seljuk Empire]] in the [[11th century]]. However, Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early [[20th century]] (see [[Rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). The Turks in [[Thrace]] were forced to leave their homes and settle in Anatolia during the [[Balkan Wars]]. The last population exchange, as result of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], between Turkey and Greece eliminated the majority of Turks in Greece and Greeks in Turkey. A significant [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] ethnic and linguistic minority exists in the south eastern regions, while [[Armenian people|Armenians]] have a waning presence in the northeast and in cities.

== States of Anatolia ==
Anatolia has been the center of many great states throughout history. The first known state was built by Hittites.

== Ottoman Rule of Asia Minor after 1885==
After 1885, with the governing reforms of [[Tanzimat]], the control of the Ottoman land in Asia Minor divided into 15 [[vilayet]]s, one [[sanjak]] and one mutersaflik of the vilayet of [[Constantinople]] (both being on the asiatic side of the [[Bosporus]]).

Every vilayet was further divided in a number of sanjaks.

More specifically the political division of Asia Minor in 1915 was as follows;

* Vilayet of [[Izmir]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Manisa]], Izmir, [[Aydin]], [[Denizli]], [[Mentese]]
* Independent vilayet of the [[Dardanelles]]
* Vilayet of [[Bursa Province|Bursa]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Balikesir]], Bursa, Erdogrul, [[Kutahya]], [[Afyon]]
* Vilayet of [[Konya]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Burdur]], [[Hamid abad]], [[Atalya]], Konya, [[Nigde]]
* Vilayet of [[Kastamonu]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Bolu]], [[Cankiri]], Kastamonu, [[Sinop]]
* Vilayet of [[Ankara]] divided in the sanjaks of Ankara, [[Kirsehir]], [[Yozgat]], [[Kayseri]]
* Vilayet of [[Adana]], divided in the sanjaks of Icel([[Mersin]]), Adana, Hozan, Jebel-i-Bereket
* Vilayet of [[Sivas]] divided in the sanjaks of Sivas, [[Tokat]], [[Amasya]], Karahisar-Sarki
* Vilayet of [[Trabzon]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Samsun]], Trabzon, Argiropolis, [[Lazistan]]
* Vilayet of [[Erzurum]]
* Vilayet of [[Bitlis]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Mus]], Ghen, [[Siirt]]
* Vilayet of [[Van]] divided in the sanjaks of Van, [[Hakkari]]
* Vilayet of Mosul divided in the sanjaks of Mosul, Sehrizan, Suleymanih
* Vilayet of Mamure-ul-Azil divided in the sanjak of [[Diyarbakir]] and the mutersaflik of Zor
* Vilayet of Halep divided in the sanjaks of Halep, [[Urfa]], [[Kahramanmara≈ü|Maras]]
Also the
* Independent mutersaflik of [[Izmit]] and
* the sanjak of [[Uskudar]]

== Ethnic distribution in Asia Minor in the early 20th century (before the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]) ==

Based on French [[census]] files of [[1915]] the total population of Asia Minor (not including [[Eastern Thrace]], the vilayets of the orient &amp; the city of Constantinople) was 10,372,411 persons of all nationalities and religions.

More specifically the distribution of differerent [[ethnic group]]s as per [[Vilayet]] and [[Sanjak]] is as follows;

'''Apple Computer, Inc.  '''({{nasdaq|AAPL}} and {{lse|ACP}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer]] technology company. Its headquarters are located at 1 [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]], part of [[Silicon Valley]]. Apple was a major player in the [[personal computer]] revolution in the 1970s.

The [[Apple II]] [[microcomputer]], introduced in 1977, was a hit with home users. In 1983, Apple introduced the first commercial personal computer to use a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]. In 1984, Apple introduced the revolutionary [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. The Macintosh (commonly called the &quot;Mac&quot;) was the first successful commercial implementation of a GUI, which is now used in all major computers.

Apple is known for its innovative, well-designed hardware and software, such as the [[Apple iPod | iPod]] and the [[iMac]], as well as the well-known [[iTunes]] application (part of the [[iLife]] suite) and [[Mac OS X]], its current [[operating system]]. 

==History==
{{main|History of Apple Computer}}


===1976 to 1980 - The founding of Apple===
Apple Computer was founded in [[Los Gatos, California]] on [[April 1]], [[1976]] by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Ronald Wayne]], to sell the [[Apple I]] personal computer kit at $666.66. They were hand-built in Jobs' parents' garage, and the Apple I was first shown to the public at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. 

Jobs and Wozniak, (&quot;the two Steves&quot;) had been friends since 1971. Jobs managed to interest Wozniak in assembling a personal computer and selling it. Jobs approached a local computer store, The Byte Shop, who, after Jobs' famous persuasion, ordered fifty units and paid $500 for each unit. Jobs then ordered components from Cramer Electronics, a national electronic parts distributor. Using a variety of methods, including borrowing space from friends and family and selling various items including a [[VW Type 2|Volkswagen Type 2 bus]], Jobs managed to secure the parts needed while Wozniak and another friend, [[Ronald Wayne]], assembled the Apple I. They were delivered in June, and paid for on delivery. Eventually 200 Apple I computers were built.

Note that the original Apple I was actually a motherboard, it was not a full computer as we know it today.

The [[Apple II]] was introduced on [[April 16]], [[1977]] at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It was popular with home users and was occasionally sold to business users, particularly after the release of the first spreadsheet for any computer called [[VisiCalc]]. (See the timeline for dates of Apple II family model releases&amp;mdash;the 1977 Apple II and its younger siblings, the II Plus, IIe, IIc and IIGS.) But it was a mild success for the small computer company.

By now, Jobs and his partners had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The Apple II was succeeded by the [[Apple III]] in May 1980 as the company struggled to compete against [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the lucrative business and corporate computing market. The designers of the Apple III were forced to comply with Jobs' request to omit the cooling fan, and this ultimately resulted in thousands of recalled units due to overheating. An updated version was introduced in 1983 but it was also a failure due to bad press and discouraged buyers. Nevertheless, the principals of the company persevered with further innovations and marketing.

Jobs and several other Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979, to see the [[Alto (computer)|Alto computer]]. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for selling them one million dollars in pre-[[IPO]] Apple stock (approximately $18 million net).

===1981 to 1989 - Lisa and Macintosh===
[[Image:Ad_apple_1984.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The protagonist of Apple's well known [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 ad]], set in a [[dystopia]]n future modeled after the [[Orwellian]] novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]].]]
In the early 1980s, IBM and Microsoft continued to gain market share at Apple's expense in the personal computer industry. Using a fundamentally different business model, [[IBM]] marketed an open hardware standard created with the [[IBM PC]], which was bundled with [[Microsoft]]'s [[MS-DOS]] (MicroSoft-Disk Operating System). In 1983, Apple introduced the first [[personal computer]] to be sold to the public with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), named the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]. Using a GUI, the user communicates with the computer by interacting with icons onscreen that resemble real-world items (folders, documents, images). However, the Lisa was a commercial failure as a result of its high price tag ($9995) and limited software titles.

After the Lisa, Apple began work on a similar but less expensive computer to be called the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. It was launched in 1984 with the now famous [[1984 (television commercial)|Super Bowl advertisement]] based on [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''. It was an immediate success, particularly in the world of graphic and communications design, where its [[GUI]] (which was to become the industry standard) and ability to handle large graphic files surpassed anything else on the market. The Macintosh also spawned the concept of [[Apple evangelist|Mac evangelism]] among users, which was pioneered by Apple employee and later Apple Fellow, [[Guy Kawasaki]]. 

In anticipation of the Macintosh launch, [[Bill Gates]], co-founder and chairman of [[Microsoft]], was given several Macintosh prototypes in 1983 to develop software for the &quot;Mac&quot;. In 1985, Microsoft launched [[Microsoft Windows]], with its own GUI for IBM PCs using many of the elements of the Macintosh OS.

An internal power struggle developed between Jobs and new CEO [[John Sculley]] in 1985. Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley, and Jobs was asked to resign from the company. Jobs then founded [[NeXT]] Inc., a computer company that built machines with futuristic designs and ran the UNIX-derived [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTstep]] operating system. Although powerful, NeXT computers never caught on with buyers, due in part to their high purchase price.

===1990 to 1993 - PowerBook and decline===
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple turned to industrial designers and adopted a product strategy based in three portable devices. One portable was built by [[Sony]], which had a strong reputation for designing small, durable and functional electronics devices. Sony took the specs of the Mac Portable, put in a smaller two-hour battery, a much smaller (physically) twenty [[megabyte]] [[Hard disk|hard drive]] and a smaller nine-inch [[Liquid crystal display|passive matrix screen]]. 

Called the [[Powerbook|PowerBook 100]], this landmark product was introduced in 1991 and established the modern form and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the [[laptop computer]]. This solidified Apple's reputation as a quality manufacturer, both of desktop and now portable machines. The success of the PowerBook and several other Apple products during this period led to increasing revenue. The [[magazine]] ''[[MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 to 1991 the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh. 

This golden age was not to last. The introduction of [[Microsoft Windows]] presented an interface that many people thought was close enough to the Macintosh in terms of ease of use and overall look and feel. Apple thought that Windows was ''too'' close, and sued [[Microsoft]] for theft of intellectual property.

At about the same time, Apple branched out into consumer electronics. One example of this product diversification was the [[Apple QuickTake]] digital camera (which never caught on). A more famous example was the [[Apple Newton|Newton]], an early [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] that was introduced in 1993. Though it failed commercially, it defined and launched the new category of computing and was a forerunner and inspiration of devices such as [[BlackBerry]], [[Palm Pilot]] and its descendants-[[PocketPC]]s.

During the 1990s, Apple greatly expanded its computer lineup as well. It offered a multitude of different models, yet it failed to adequately explain to the public why it should choose one model over another.

The costs involved in making such a wide variety of products, coupled with some highly-publicized product recalls and the growing popularity of Microsoft Windows, all lead to the near-bankruptcy of Apple in the mid-to-late 1990s.


=== 1994 to 1997 - Attempts at reinvention ===

By the mid-1990s, Apple realized that it had to reinvent the Macintosh in order to stay competitive in the computer world. The needs of both computer users and computer programs were becoming, for a variety of technical reasons, harder for the existing hardware and operating system to address.

In 1994, Apple surprised its loyalists by allying with its long-time competitor IBM and Motorola in the so-called [[AIM alliance]]. This was a bid to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] or PReP) which would use IBM and [[Motorola]] hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft, which had become Apple's chief competitor.

Towards this end, Apple tried to recruit other companies that would build PReP-compliant computers. Apple hoped to expand the Mac OS market share by licensing the operating system to these other companies, like Microsoft had promoted DOS and Windows by licensing them to external manufacturers. Only a few companies--notably [[Power Computing]] and [[UMAX]]--agreed to produce these computers. But eventually the licensing program was suspended.

As the first step toward launching the PReP platform, Apple started the [[Power Macintosh]] line in 1994, using IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor. This processor utilized a [[RISC]] architecture, which differed substantially from the Motorola [[68k]] series that had been used by all previous Macs. Apple's OS's were rewritten so that most software for the older Macs could run on the PowerPC series (in [[emulation]]).

Also throughout the mid to late 1990s, Apple tried to improve its operating system's multitasking and memory management. After first attempting to modify its existing code, Apple realized that it would be better to start with an entirely new operating system and then modify it to fit the Macintosh interface. Apple did some preliminary work with IBM towards this goal with the [[Taligent]] project, but that project never produced a replacement operating system. They then investigated using [[Be Incorporated|Be]]'s [[BeOS]], [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTstep]] OS, and also Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] OS. NeXTstep was chosen, and this supplied the platform for the modern OS X.

On [[February 4]], [[1997]], Apple completed its purchase of NeXT and its NeXTstep operating system, thus bringing Steve Jobs back into Apple. On [[July 9]], [[1997]], [[Gil Amelio]] was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors after overseeing a 12-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses, despite an outstanding decade of innovation. Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO and began a critical restructuring of the company's product line.

===1998 to 2005 - New beginnings===
[[Image:Steve Jobs with iMac.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Steve Jobs]] introducing the original [[iMac]] computer in 1998.]]
In 1998, a year after Jobs had returned to the company, Apple introduced a new all-in-one Macintosh (echoing the original [[Macintosh 128K]]): the [[iMac]], a new design that eliminated most Apple-standard connections like [[SCSI]] and [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] in favor of two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. While technically not impressive (it was aimed at a general market), it featured an innovative new design - its translucent plastic case, originally [[Bondi blue (color)|Bondi Blue]] and [[white]], and later many other colors, is considered an industrial design hallmark of the late-[[1990s|90s]]. 

The iMac design team was led by Jonathan Ive (who later also designed the iPod).  The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 1998, making the company a profit that year of $309 million - Apple's first profitable year since [[Michael Spindler]] took the position of CEO of the company in 1993. The Power Macintosh was redesigned along similar lines, and continues to evolve to this day.

At the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] Apple purchased the Final Cut software from [[Macromedia]], beginning their entry into the [[digital video]] editing market. [[iMovie]] was released in [[1999]], for consumers, and [[Final Cut Pro]] was released for professionals in the same year. Final Cut Pro has gone on to be a significant video editing program. Similarly, in [[2000]], Apple bought [[Astarte]]'s DVDirector software, which morphed into [[iDVD]] (for consumers) and [[DVD Studio Pro]] (for professionals) at the [[Macworld Conference and Expo]] of [[2001]].

In 2001, Apple introduced [[Mac OS X]], the operating system based on NeXT's [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTstep]] and [[BSD]] Unix. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Apple claims that OS X marries stability, reliability and security of the [[Unix]] operating system with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface. To aid users in moving their applications from OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of [[Mac OS 9]] applications through OS X's [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic environment]]. Apple's [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] API also allowed developers to adapt their OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features with a (claimed) simple re-compile.

[[Image:Applecomputerheadquarters.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Company headquarters on [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]] in [[Cupertino]], [[California]].]]
In May 2001, after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of the [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple retail store]]s, to be located in major U.S. consumer locations. These stores were designed for two purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market and to counter a poor record of marketing Apple products by third-party retail outlets.

In late 2001, Apple introduced its first [[iPod]] portable [[digital audio player]], a move that has proven to be phenomenally successful with over 42 million units sold even though it was not originally perceived to be a successful product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625262.stm BBC News story on Apple's first quarter 2006 earnings report]&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a scheme to offer downloadable songs at US 99 cents per song through Apple's [[ITunes Music Store|iTunes Music Store]], there had been over [http://www.apple.com/itunes/1billion/ 1,000,000,000] downloads for iPod players by February 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf06/ Steve Jobs' January 2006 MacWorld keynote address]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In [[2002]], Apple purchased [[Nothing Real]], and their advanced digital compositing application, [[Shake (software)|Shake]], raising Apple's professional commitment even higher. In the same year they also acquired [[Emagic]], and with it, obtained their professional-quality music productivity application, [[Logic Pro|Logic]], which led to the development of their consumer-level [[GarageBand]] application. With [[iPhoto]]'s release in 2002 as well, this completed Apple's collection of consumer and professional level creativity software, with the consumer-level applications being collected together into the [[iLife]] suite.

On March 10, 2005 Apple Computer announced its support for [[Sony]]'s [[Blu-Ray]] technology and joined the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], or BDA. In a keynote address on [[June 6]], [[2005]], Steve Jobs officially announced that Apple would begin producing Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Apple press release [http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs confirmed [[Mac rumors community|rumor]]s that the company had secretly been producing versions of its current operating system [[Mac OS X]] for both PowerPC and Intel processors for the previous five years, and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. 

Jobs surprised the industry at Macworld 2006 however, by announcing the first Intel based Apple computers would begin selling January 2006 and that the transition would be complete by the end of that same year. Mac OS X is based on [[OPENSTEP]], an operating system originally available for many platforms. Apple's own [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], the [[open source]] underpinnings of OS X, is also compiled for Intel's ''x''86 architecture.&lt;ref&gt;See articles from [http://news.com.com/Apple+shakes+hands+with+Intel/2009-1006_3-5733319.html news.com], [http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1112 Apple insider], and [http://nytimes.com/2005/06/06/technology/06apple.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of the [[Power Mac G5]] in [[June 2003]], Apple abandoned flashy colors in favor of white [[polycarbonate]] for consumer lines such as the iMac and iBook, as well as the educational [[eMac]], and anodized [[aluminum]] or [[titanium]] for professional products like the [[Power Mac G5]], [[PowerBook G4]] and [[MacBook Pro]], as well as the low-cost [[Mac mini]].

[[Image:MacBook.jpg|right|thumb|The new [[MacBook Pro]] is Apple's first consumer laptop with an Intel microprocessor.]]

===2006 to present - Start of the Intel era===
{{main|Apple Intel transition}}
On [[January 10]], [[2006]], Apple released its first [[Intel]] chip computers, a new [[notebook computer]] known as the [[MacBook Pro]] (a 15.4 inch laptop which replaced the [[PowerBook]] G4 line and offers a 4X speed improvement) and a new (though identical) [[iMac]] with a 2-3 times faster performance increase. Both used Intel's [[Intel Core|Core Duo]] chip technology. 

The current operating system, OS X Tiger 10.4(.5), runs natively on the new Intel machines, as do many applications, such as iLife '06. Other applications, such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]], compiled for the PowerPC, run in emulation mode, using a technology known as [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]. 

(see [[Apple Intel transition]] for more information regarding the transition)

The Intel-based machines do not support Classic (as it has not been translated to x86 binaries), so applications that run only in Mac OS 9 and earlier will not run on these machines. All Macintosh product lines are expected to transition to Intel processors by the end of 2006. The Apple online store sold out of 17-inch iMac G5 computers in [[February 2006]], and Apple ended the life of its 15 inch PowerBook G4 on Wednesday the 22nd of February 2006.

The Apple/Intel partnership has coined a new catch-phrase among computer users: &quot;Mactel&quot;, in response to the phrase &quot;[[Wintel]],&quot; an informal moniker that describes all Intel-powered systems running the Microsoft Windows operating system. This moniker has never been used seriously by Apple's PR or exceutives, mainly in use only in Apple fanatic circles.

===Hardware===
Apple introduced the [[Apple Macintosh]] family in 1984 and today makes consumer, professional, and educational computers. The [[Mac mini]] is the company's consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in January 2005 and designed to motivate [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users to switch to the Macintosh platform. The [[iMac]] is a consumer desktop computer that was first introduced by Apple in 1998, and its popularity helped save the company from bankruptcy. Now in its third design iteration, the iMac is similar in concept to the original Macintosh in that the monitor and computer are housed in a single unit. The [[Power Mac G5]], Apple's desktop computer for the professional and creative market, is a member of the [[Power Macintosh]] series first introduced in 1994. The [[eMac]] is Apple's cheaper alternative to the iMac for the education market. Apple's server range includes the [[Xserve]], a single-processor, dual-processor, and cluster-node server range, and the [[Xserve RAID]] for server storage options.

Apple introduced the [[iBook]] consumer portable computer as a companion to the iMac; it is Apple's lowest cost portable computer. The [[MacBook Pro]] is the professional portable computer alternative to the iBook intended for the professional and creative market and replaced the [[PowerBook]] range. PowerBooks are still being manufactured and sold, but is expected that Apple will phase out both the PowerBook and iBook lines upon arrival of the heavily rumoured MacBook, the low end version of the [[MacBook Pro]] and [[Intel]]-based version of the [[iBook]]. The Powerbook range was first introduced in 1991 and helped Apple's profits increase during the 1990s.

In 2001, Apple introduced the [[Apple iPod |iPod]] [[digital music player]] and currently sells the iPod (with video), available in 30 and 60 GB models; the [[iPod nano]], available in 1 GB, 2GB and 4 GB models; and the [[iPod shuffle]], available in 512 MB and 1 GB models. 

[[Image:MacminiWhiteBGSmall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mac mini]] is Apple's lowest cost desktop computer.]]
Apple sells a variety of computer accessories for Macintosh computers including the [[iSight]] video conferencing camera, the [[AirPort]] wirelss networking products; [[Apple Cinema Display|Apple Cinema HD Display]] and [[Apple Displays]] computer displays; [[Apple Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]] and [[Apple Wireless Mouse]] computer mice; the [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]] computer keyboard and the [[Apple USB Modem]].

===Software===
Apple independently develops [[computer software]] titles for its [[Mac OS X]] operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented [[iLife]] software package which bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie|iMovie HD]], [[iPhoto]], [[iTunes]], [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. Both [[iTunes]] and a feature-limited version of the [[QuickTime]] media player are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and Windows.  For presentation and page layout, [[iWork]] is available.

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the [[Mac OS X Server]] operating system; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote desktop control application; [[WebObjects]], [[Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java]] [[World Wide Web|Web]] [[application server]]; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creatives market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Studio]], a video software package, as well as [[Final Cut Express HD]], a cut-down version, for [[Standard-definition television|SD]] and [[High-definition television|HD]] video editors; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit, and [[Logic Express]], its prosumer cousin; and [[Shake (software)|Shake]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[.Mac]] which bundles [[Web page|.Mac HomePage]], [[E-mail|.Mac Mail]], .Mac Groups [[social network service]], [[iDisk|.Mac iDisk]], [[Backup (backup software)|.Mac Backup]], [[iSync|.Mac Sync]], and Learning Center online tutorials.

==Corporate affairs==
===Logo===
[[Image:Originalapplelogo.jpg|thumb|left|110px|The original Apple logo featuring [[Isaac Newton]] under the fabled apple tree.]]
[[Image:Striped apple logo.png|thumb|right|110px|The rainbow Apple logo, used from late 1976 to early 1998.]]
[[Image:Apple-logo.png|thumb|right|110px|The current Apple logo. On products, a simple gray version of the Apple is used, without embellishing it as has been done to computerized images.]]

The original Apple logo was designed by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Ron Wayne]] and depicts Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. However this design was soon to be replaced by the now famous [[rainbow]] apple with a &quot;bite&quot; taken out of it. It was one of a set of designs [[Rob Janoff]] presented Jobs in 1976 &lt;ref&gt;[http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,60597,00.html Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the book Zeroes and Ones, author [[Sadie Plant]] speculates that the rainbow Apple logo was a homage to [[Alan Turing]], the homosexual father of modern computer science who committed suicide by eating a cyanide-laced apple in imitation of the movie ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. This seems to be an [[urban legend]] as the Apple logo was designed two years before [[Gilbert Baker]]'s [[Rainbow flag|rainbow pride flag]], and did not follow the same color pattern.

In 1998, the logo became single-colored, though no specific color is prescribed; for example, it is grey on the [[Power Mac G5]] and [[iMac G5|Apple iMac]], blue (by default) in [[Mac OS X]], chrome on the 'About this Mac' panel and the boot screen in OS X 10.3 and 10.4, red on many [[Software]] packages, and white on the [[iBook]], [[PowerBook G4]] and [[MacBook Pro]]. The logo's shape is one of the most recognized brand symbols in the world, and is featured quite prominently on all Apple products and retail stores.

===Criticism===
Apple was criticized for its [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] business model, which runs against the  &quot;received wisdom&quot; of some economists, particularly those who study the computer industry. However, the company is profitable. Others criticize the company by suggesting it has been personality-driven, especially during the two eras of Steve Jobs' tenure. Some even regard the company as a cult or at least having cult-like features. Jobs' charisma, infamously referred to as his [[reality distortion field]], has drawn criticism. 

From a technical standpoint, Apple was also criticized for having a closed and proprietary architecture with the original Macintosh and refusing to adopt open standards; for many years a &quot;[[Not Invented Here]]&quot; (NIH) culture seemed to prevail. The [[ITunes Music Store|iTunes Music Store]] continues this trend, utilizing a proprietary [[Digital rights management|Digital Rights Management]] system called [[FairPlay]] that requires burning and re-ripping a CD to place purchased songs on any [[digital audio player]] besides the [[Apple iPod | iPod]].

That trend was largely reversed with [[Mac OS X]], and the company now has an official policy of adopting relevant open industry standards. Mac OS X is based on a [[free software]] / [[Open-source software|open source software]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and core operating system called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. Apple also uses an open source framework called [[WebKit]] in its [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]]. 

Apple has used industry-standard hardware technologies for many years. Many Apple technologies have also become industry standards where no former standard existed, for example [[Zeroconf|Bonjour]] zero-configuration networking, and [[FireWire]]. Some non-Apple technologies only gained wide industry acceptance after Apple adopted them, including 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]]s, [[SCSI]], the [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB), [[Wi-Fi]] and, of course, graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Apple has recently adopted an Intel-based architecture. Apple's industry-standard software implementations include [[iCalendar]], as well as a host of other networking protocols.

[[Open-source software|Open source software]] advocates are often critical of Apple's attempt to appeal to their particular movements. Such advocates claim that such a marketing scheme is not taken seriously enough by Apple because Mac OS X has many proprietary technologies in essential areas. Other open source advocates make a counter-argument that Apple has done much more for open source software than many other major commercial software developers by releasing large portions of source code to the public through the [[Apple Public Source License]] (APSL). Some third-party developers are also critical of the competing factions within Apple itself, noting an apparent rivalry between the developers of [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], which came from NeXT, and those of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]], which came from Apple. This rivalry is seen as counterproductive and unnecessary by many developers.

Apple's retail initiative has had a mixed reception despite its success promoting the Apple brand. Retailers have suggested that Apple-owned retail stores receive preference when receiving Apple hardware, obtaining limited stock product earlier and at lower prices. This accusation is denied by Apple.

==User culture==
:''See Also: [[Cult of Mac]]''

Some Apple customers are devoted to their brand. Some refuse to buy from competitors and stridently uphold their belief in the perceived superiority of Apple products; according to surveys by [[J. D. Power]], Apple has the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer. While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. As [[Guy Kawasaki]] has said, &quot;[the brand fanaticism was] something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing] by Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba&lt;/ref&gt;

Macintosh users meet at the [[Apple Expo]] and [[MacWorld Expo]] trade shows where Apple introduces new products each year to the industry and public. Many users show their loyalty and devotion by wearing Apple [[t-shirt]]s. Another example of Apple's user culture is the [[Apple_Store_%28retail%29|Apple Store]] openings where many wait and sleep outside of stores for days prior to their openings.

[[John Sculley]], former Apple CEO, told the Guardian newspaper in 1997: &quot;''People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company, It was the marketing company of the decade.''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/0,56677-0.html Wired News: Apple: It's All About the Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable litigation==
{{main|Notable litigation of Apple Computer}}
Apple's earliest court action dates to 1978 when [[Apple Records|Apple Corps]], [[The Beatles]]-founded record label, filed suit against Apple Computer for trademark infringement. The suit settled in 1981 with an amount of $80,000 being paid to Apple Corps. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. The case arose in 1989 again when Apple Corps sued, claiming violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement of around $26.5 million was reached. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/Apple+vs.+Apple+Perfect+harmony/2100-1027_3-5378401.html news.com: Apple vs. Apple: Perfect harmony?]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003 Apple Computer was sued by Apple Corps again, this time for introducing [[iTunes]] and the [[Apple iPod | iPod]] which Apple Corps believed was a violation of the previous agreement by Apple not to distribute music. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalzoom.com/articles/article_content/article11325.html legalzoom.com: Apple v Apple: What is at the core of The Beatles‚Äô Apple Records vs. Apple Ipod‚Ä¶]&lt;/ref&gt; The date for this trial has been set for [[March 27]], [[2006]] in the UK. At the present time [[the Beatles]]' songs are not available for download from any legal music download sites, including the [[iTunes Music Store]].

In 1982 Apple filed a lawsuit against [[Franklin Computer Corp.]], alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of Apple's [[operating system]] and [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. [[Apple v. Franklin]] established the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software. As a result, Apple began embedding an encrypted image in ROM. This icon displays &quot;Stolen from Apple Computer&quot;.

In 1988 Apple sued Microsoft and [[Hewlett-Packard]] on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyright on a GUI. The [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.]] trial lasted for four years. The ruling was decided against Apple, and the concept of a GUI was no longer the domain of Apple alone.

In July 1998 [[Abdul Traya]] registered the domain name ''appleimac.com'', two months after Apple announced the [[iMac]], in an attempt to draw attention to a web-hosting business. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-1023-221921.html news.com: Teen in dispute with Apple over domain]&lt;/ref&gt; After a legal dispute that lasted until April 1999, Traya and Apple settled out of court with Apple paying legal fees and giving Traya a &quot;''token payment''&quot; in exchange for the domain name. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macobserver.com/news/99/april/990427/applevsteen.html macobserver.com:  Battle For Domain Name Between Apple And Teen Resolved]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Apple was sued by the astronomer and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]] for using his name as the internal code-name for the [[Power Macintosh 7100]]. Sagan lost the suit twice. See the Carl Sagan [[Carl Sagan#Personality|article]] for details.

In November 2000, [[Benjamin Cohen]] of [http://www.cyberbritain.co.uk CyberBritain] registered the domain name &quot;itunes.co.uk&quot; for an MP3 search engine. Apple was granted a UK restricted (non music) trademark for ITUNES on [[March 23]], [[2001]], and launched its popular iTunes music store service in the UK in 2004. In 2005, Apple took the matter to the Dispute Resolution Service operated by [[.uk]] [[domain|domain name]] [[registry]] [[Nominet UK]], stating that they had rights in the name &quot;iTunes&quot;. An expert decided in Apple's favor in the dispute. Cohen launched a media offensive stating that the DRS was biased towards large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet.

In November 2004, two popular [[weblog]] sites that feature [[Mac rumors community|Apple rumors]] publicly revealed information about an unreleased Apple product code-named &quot;Asteroid&quot;, also known as &quot;Project Q97&quot;. The sites, &quot;AppleInsider&quot; and &quot;PowerPage&quot;, were subpoenaed for information about their sources in the [[Apple v. Does]] case. In February 2005 it was decided by a court official in California that the bloggers do not have the same [[shield law]] protection as do journalists. In a related case, the websites went on to fight the journalistic status decision. In a separate matter, Apple filed a lawsuit against website [[Think Secret]] in January 2005, claiming that the site's reports about forthcoming Apple products violated trade secret law.

In May 2005 Apple entered into a [[class action]] settlement &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleipodsettlement.com http://www.appleipodsettlement.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, upheld on December 20, 2005 following an appeal, regarding the battery life of [[Apple iPod | iPod]] music players sold prior to May 2004.  Eligible members of the class are entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement.

'''Aberdeenshire''' (''Siorrachd Obar Dheathain'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is one of the 32 [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[council areas]] in [[Scotland]].

Present day Aberdeenshire does not include the [[City of Aberdeen]] which is a unitary authority in its own right. However Aberdeenshire council has its headquarters at Woodhill House, Westburn Road, in  [[Aberdeen]] - The only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outside of the council area. It also borders [[Angus]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Highland]], and [[Moray]]. 

==History==
The present council area is named after the historic [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeenshire]] which had different boundaries and was abolished in [[1975]]. Between 1975 and 1996 the area became part of the [[Regions of Scotland|region]] of [[Grampian]]. When the Scottish regions were abolished, a new unitary council area of Aberdeenshire was created, which revived the name of the former county but with different boundaries.

==Aberdeenshire council==
Aberdeenshire Council was established in April [[1996]], replacing three [[District council]]s ([[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]] and [[Kincardine and Deeside]]) and part of the area of [[Grampian Region]]al Council.

There are 68 [[councillor]]s; in 2004 they were 28 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 15 [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], 14 Independent and 11 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].

The Council's net expenditure is ¬£399.1m a year (2003/04).

Education takes the largest share of expenditure (55%), followed by Social Work and Housing (19%), Transportation and Infrastructure (11%), and Joint Services such as Fire and Police (10%). 22% of revenue is raised locally through the Council Tax. Average Band D [[Council Tax]] is the eighth lowest in mainland Scotland at ¬£966 (2003/04).

The council area has a population of 226,871, representing 4.5% of Scotland's total, and a 20% increase since 1981, 50% since 1971. Major towns are Peterhead (17,947), Fraserburgh (12,454), Inverurie (10,882), Stonehaven (9,577), Westhill (9,498) and Ellon (8,754). The population has a higher proportion of younger age groups than the rest of Scotland, reflecting employment-driven in-migration in recent decades.

The council has devolved power to six [[area committee]]s:
*[[Banff &amp; Buchan]],
*[[Buchan]],
*[[Formartine]],
*[[Garioch]],
*[[Marr]],
*[[Kincardine &amp; Mearns]]

;'''Banff &amp; Buchan'''
Population 35,742 (2001 Census)

Fishing and agriculture are important industries, together with associated processing and service activity.

The area is relatively self-contained, and in recent years has seen a small decline in population. It does, however, have tourism assets in its coastline, coastal villages and [[visitor attraction]]s. Economic dependency, peripherality, and the future of the Common Fisheries/Agricultural Policies, are key issues. The Buchan Local Action Plan will address some of these concerns. The Area qualifies for [[European Union Objective 2]] structural funding.

;'''Buchan'''
Population 39,160 (2001 Census)

[[Peterhead]] is the largest town in Aberdeenshire; the principal white fish landing port in Europe; and a major oil industry service centre. Equally important, is the nearby gas terminal at [[St Fergus]].

Attempts are being made to counter the negative effects of several recent key company closures and economic threats. Inland, the area is dependent upon agriculture, and many villages have seen a decline in population and services. Issues affecting Banff and Buchan also apply here, as does the future of the oil and gas industry. Part of Buchan benefits from EU aid coverage. Opportunities exist through the Buchan Local Action Plan to safeguard and enhance the economic future of Peterhead and Buchan.

;'''Formartine'''
Population 36,478 (2001 Census)

Formartine has experienced rapid population growth, particularly around [[Ellon]] and [[Oldmeldrum]], and in the south east where development has spread outwith the city of Aberdeen. By contrast, the area around [[Turriff]] retains strong dependency on the traditional agricultural economy. The area's coastline and rural environment offer recreation potential.

;'''Garioch'''
Population 42,947 (2001 Census)

Centred on [[Inverurie]], a traditional rural market town, Garioch has also experienced rapid growth due to its proximity to the city of Aberdeen. Significant growth in population, services and employment is anticipated in the [[A96 road|A96]] corridor and in [[Westhill]]. The area is largely agricultural, but is strongly affected by the City's economy and the oil and gas sector. Garioch holds growing potential for tourism, in its environment and archaeological heritage.

;'''Marr'''
Population 34,038 (2001 Census)

To the west, the mountain environment of the [[Cairngorms]] [[National Park]] sustains a well developed tourist industry based on heritage and outdoor pursuits. Forestry and livestock farming are key industries, particularly in remoter areas. Part of the area has qualified for EU financial assistance. To the east, Marr has experienced population growth due to its strong commuter links with the city of Aberdeen.

;'''Kincardine and Mearns'''
Population 38,506 (2001 Census)

Transport links with Aberdeen have encouraged very rapid population growth, especially to the north of the area. Existing settlements such as [[Portlethen]] and [[Stonehaven]] have greatly expanded, along with industrial activity. The southern part is more self-contained, with the fertile Mearns area sustaining a strong agricultural economy. Small scale tourism activity exists along its attractive coastline and former fishing villages.

[[Image:1anschluss.gif|thumb|right|250px|German troops march into [[Austria]] on [[12 March]] [[1938]].]]
The '''Anschluss'''{{ref|spelling}} ([[German language|German]]: ''connection'', or ''political union''), also known as the '''Anschluss √ñsterreichs''', was the 1938 inclusion of [[Austria]] into &quot;[[Gro√üdeutschland|Greater Germany]]&quot; by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]].

The events of [[March 12]], [[1938]], were the first major steps in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s long-desired expansion of [[Germany]]. The Anschluss followed the return to Germany of the [[Saarland#History|Saar]] region, which had been under the control of the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was followed by the inclusion of the [[Sudetenland]] later in 1938, the invasion of the remainder of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, and the [[Polish September Campaign|invasion of Poland]].

The Anschluss was preceded by a period of growing political pressure on [[Austria]], exerted by Germany, demanding recognition of the outlawed Austrian National-Socialist party and later, their share of Government.  In 1938 Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], in a last bid to retain Austrian independence, announced a referendum to determine independence or union with Germany. Germany then pressured Schuschnigg into handing over power to the Nazi party. This well-planned [[Coup d'√©tat|internal overthrow]] by the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi Party]] of Austria's state institutions in [[Vienna]] on [[March 11]] meant that when [[Wehrmacht]] troops entered into Austria to enforce the Anschluss, no fighting ever took place. The international response to the Anschluss was mild: The [[World War I]] [[Allies]] only lodged diplomatic protests, and no concrete action was taken to reverse the Anschluss, even though the allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. Austria ceased to exist as an independent nation until a preliminary Austrian government was finally reinstated on [[April 27]], [[1945]], and was legally recognized by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the following months.

:''Main articles: [[German Empire]] and [[Austrofascism]]''

The idea of grouping all German people into one state had been the subject of inconclusive debate since the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806. Prior to 1866, it was generally thought that the unification of the German peoples could only succeed under Austrian leadership (''[[Grossdeutschland]]''), but the loss of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] by Austria allowed [[Otto von Bismarck]] to establish the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]] in 1871 without the German-speaking parts of [[Austria-Hungary]] (''[[Kleindeutschland]]''). When the latter broke up in 1918, many German-speaking Austrians hoped to join with Germany in the realignment of Europe, but the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 explicitly vetoed the inclusion of Austria within a German state, because [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] feared the power of a larger Germany.

In the early 1930s, popular support for union with Germany remained overwhelming, and the Austrian government looked to a possible [[customs union]] with Germany in 1931. However Hitler's and the [[Nazi]]s' rise to power in Germany left the Austrian government with little enthusiasm for such formal ties. Hitler, born in Austria, had promoted an &quot;all-German Reich&quot; from the early beginnings of his leadership in the [[NSDAP]] and had publicly stated as early as 1924 in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' that he would attempt a union, by force if necessary.

[[Austria]] shared the economic turbulence of post-1929 Europe with a high unemployment rate and unstable commerce and industry. Similar to its northern and southern neighbours these uncertain conditions made the young democracy very vulnerable. The [[First Republic]], dominated from the late 1920s by the Catholic nationalist [[Christian Social Party]] (CS), gradually disintegrated from 1933 (dissolution of parliament and ban of the Austrian National Socialists) to 1934 ([[Austrian Civil War]] in February and ban of all remaining parties except the CS) and evolved into a pseudo-[[fascist]], [[corporatist]] model of one-party government which combined the CS and the paramilitary [[Heimwehr]] with absolute state domination of [[labour relations]] and no [[freedom of the press]] (see [[Austrofascism]] and [[Patriotic Front (Austria)|Patriotic Front]]). Power was centralized in the office of the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] who was empowered to [[rule by decree]]. The predominance of the Christian Social Party (whose economic policies were based on the [[pope|papal]] [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'') was an Austrian phenomenon in that Austria's national identity had strong Catholic elements which were incorporated into the movement by way of clerical authoritarian tendencies which are certainly not to be found in Nazism. Both [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and his successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] turned to Austria's other fascist neighbour, [[Italy]], for inspiration and support. Indeed, the statist corporatism often referred to as Austrofascism bore more resemblance to [[Fascism|Italian Fascism]] than German National Socialism. [[Benito Mussolini]] was able to support the independent aspirations of the Austrian dictatorship until his need for German support in [[Ethiopia]] forced him into a client relationship with Berlin that began with the 1937 [[Axis Powers|Berlin-Rome Axis]].

When Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the illegal [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi party]] on [[25 July]] [[1934]] in a failed coup, the second civil war within only one year followed, lasting until August 1934. After the failed Nazi coup, many leading Austrian Nazis fled to [[Germany]] and continued to coordinate their steps from there while the remaining Austrian Nazis started to make use of terrorist attacks against the Austrian governmental institutions (causing a death toll of more than 800 between 1934 and 1938). Dollfuss' successor Schuschnigg, who followed the political course of Dollfuss, took drastic actions against the Nazis, for instance the rounding up of Nazis (but also Social Democrats) in [[internment camps]].

==The Anschluss of 1938==
===Hitler's first moves===
[[Image:1ajansa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alfred Jansa was forced to retire as Chief of Staff in January 1938]]

In early 1938 Hitler had consolidated his power in Germany and was ready to reach out to fulfil his long-planned expansion. After a lengthy period of pressure by Germany, Hitler met Schuschnigg on [[12 February]] [[1938]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] ([[Bavaria]]) and instructed him to lift the ban of the Austrian Nazi party, reinstate full party freedoms, release all imprisoned members of the [[Nazi]] party and let them participate in the government. Otherwise he would take military action. Schuschnigg complied with Hitler's demands and appointed [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], a Nazi lawyer, as [[Interior Minister]] and another Nazi, [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau]], as Minister without Portfolio.{{ref|encarta}}

Even before the February meeting, Schuschnigg was under considerable pressure from Germany. This may be seen in the demand to remove the chief of staff of the [[Austrian Army]] [[Alfred Jansa]] from his office in January 1938. Jansa and his staff had developed a scenario for Austria's defence against a German attack, a situation Hitler wanted to avoid at all costs. Schuschnigg subsequently complied with the demand.{{ref|wienerzeitung}}

During the following weeks Schuschnigg realized that his newly appointed ministers were gradually working on taking over his authority. Schuschnigg tried to gather support throughout Austria and inflame [[patriotism]] among the people. For the first time since [[12 February]] [[1934]] (the time of the [[Austrian Civil War]]), socialists and communists could legally appear in public again. The [[communists]] announced their unconditional support for the Austrian government, understandable in light of Nazi pressure on Austria. The [[socialists]] demanded further concessions from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him.

===Schuschnigg announces a referendum===
On [[9 March]], as a last resort to preserve Austria's independence, Schuschnigg scheduled a [[plebiscite]] on the [[independence]] of Austria for [[13 March]]. To secure a large majority in the referendum, Schuschnigg set the minimum voting age at 24 in order to exclude younger voters who largely sympathized with Nazi ideology. Holding a referendum was a highly risky gamble for Schuschnigg, and on the next day it became apparent that Hitler would not simply stand by while Austria declared its independence by public vote. Hitler declared that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it. In addition the German Ministry of Propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order. Schuschnigg immediately publicly replied that the reports of riots were nothing but lies‚Äîas they actually were.

Hitler sent an [[ultimatum]] to [[Schuschnigg]] on [[11 March]], demanding that he hand over all power to the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialists]] or face an invasion. The ultimatum was set to expire at noon, but was extended by two hours. However, without waiting for an answer, Hitler had already signed the order to send troops into Austria at one o'clock, issuing it to [[Hermann G√∂ring]] only hours later.

Schuschnigg desperately sought support for Austrian independence in the hours following the [[ultimatum]], but, realizing that neither [[France]] nor the [[United Kingdom]] were willing to take steps, he resigned as Chancellor that evening. In the radio broadcast in which he announced his [[resignation]], he argued that he accepted the changes and allowed the Nazis to take over the government in order to avoid bloodshed. Meanwhile, Austrian President [[Wilhelm Miklas]] refused to appoint [[Artur Seyss-Inquart|Seyss-Inquart]] Chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians such as Michael Skubl and Sigismund Schilhawsky to assume the office. However, the Nazis were well organised. Within hours they managed to take control of many parts of Vienna, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs (controlling the Police). As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government and Seyss-Inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the Austrian government demanding German troops to restore order, Hitler became furious. At about 10 pm, well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion, G√∂ring and Hitler gave up on waiting and published a forged telegram containing a request by the Austrian Government for German troops to enter Austria. Around midnight, after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested, Miklas finally conceded to appoint Seyss-Inquart Chancellor.{{ref|wienerzeitung_a}}

===German troops march into Austria===
&lt;!-- [[Image:Stimzettel-Anschluss.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Voting ballot from [[10 April]] [[1938]]. The ballot text reads &quot;Do you agree with the reunification of Austria with the German Empire that was enacted on [[13 March]] [[1938]], and do you vote for the party of our leader Adolf Hitler?,&quot; the large circle is labelled &quot;Yes,&quot; the smaller &quot;No.&quot;]] --&gt;
[[Image:Voting-booth-Anschluss-10-April-1938.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Propaganda even in the voting booth on [[10 April]] [[1938]], with a poster instructing voters how to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.]]

On the morning of [[12 March]] the 8th Army of the German [[Wehrmacht]] crossed the German-Austrian border. They did not face resistance by the [[Austrian Army]] ‚Äî on the contrary, the German troops were greeted by cheering Austrians. Although the invading forces were badly organized and coordination between the units was poor, it mattered little because no fighting took place. It did, however, serve as a warning for commanders in future German military operations such as that against [[Czechoslovakia]]. Curiously, the invasion claimed its first fatality within only a few hours: the Nazi [[Heinrich Kurz von Goldstein]] died of a heart attack during the celebrations in [[Salzburg]].

Hitler's car crossed the border in the afternoon at [[Braunau]], his birthplace. In the evening, he arrived at [[Linz]] and was given an enthusiastic welcome in the city hall. The atmosphere was so intense that G√∂ring in a telephone call that evening stated: &quot;There is unbelievable jubilation in Austria. We ourselves did not think that sympathies would be so intense.&quot;

Hitler's further travel through Austria changed into a triumphal tour that climaxed in [[Vienna]], when around 200,000 Austrians gathered on the [[Heldenplatz]] (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler proclaim the Austrian Anschluss ([http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.film.data.film/f107a.mpg Video: Hitler proclaims Austria's inclusion in the Reich (2MB)]). Hitler later commented: &quot;Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.&quot;{{ref|hitlerspeech}}

The Anschluss was given immediate effect by legislative act on [[13 March]], subject to ratification by a plebiscite. Austria became the [[province]] of [[Ostmark]], and Seyss-Inquart was appointed Governor. The plebiscite was held on [[10 April]] and officially recorded a support of 99.73 % of the voters.{{ref|doew}}
While historians concur that the result itself was not manipulated, the voting process was not free or secret. Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand (in contrast to a secret vote where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box). In addition, Hitler's brutal methods to emasculate any opposition had been immediately implemented in the weeks preceding the referendum. Even before the first German soldier crossed the border, [[Heinrich Himmler]] and a few [[SS]] officers landed in Vienna to arrest prominent representatives of the First Republic such as [[Richard Schmitz]], [[Leopold Figl]], [[Friedrich Hillegeist]] and [[Franz Olah]]. During the weeks following the Anschluss (and before the plebiscite), Social Democrats, Communists, and other potential political dissenters, as well as Jews, were rounded up and either imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. Within only a few days of [[12 March]], 70,000 people had been arrested. The [[referendum]] itself was subject to large-scale [[propaganda]] and to the abrogation of the voting rights of around 400,000 people (nearly 10 % of the eligible voting population), mainly former members of left-wing parties and Jews.{{ref|doew_a}}
Interestingly, in some remote areas of Austria the referendum on the independence of Austria on [[13 March]] was held despite the [[Wehrmacht]]'s presence in Austria (it took up to 3 days to occupy every part of Austria). For instance, in the village of [[Innervillgraten]] a majority of 95 % voted for Austria's independence.{{ref|wienerzeitung_b}}

Austria remained part of the [[Third Reich]] until the end of [[World War II]] when a preliminary Austrian Government declared the Anschluss void and null on [[April 27]] [[1945]]. After the war then [[allied]] occupied Austria was recognized and treated as a separate country, but was not restored to [[sovereignty]] until the [[Austrian State Treaty]] and Austrian [[Declaration of Neutrality]], both of 1955, largely due to the rapid development of the [[Cold War]] and disputes between the [[Soviet Union]] and its former allies over its foreign policy.

==Reactions and consequences of the Anschluss==
[[Image:karl-renner.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|Social Democrat Karl Renner publicly announced his support for the Anschluss]]

The picture of Austria in the first days of its existence in the [[Third Reich]] is one of contradictions: At one and the same time, Hitler's terror regime began to tighten its grip in every area of society, beginning with mass arrests and thousands of Austrians attempting to flee in every direction; yet Austrians could be seen cheering and welcoming German troops entering Austrian territory. Many Austrian political figures did not hesitate to announce their support of the Anschluss and their relief that it happened without violence.

Cardinal [[Theodor Innitzer]] (a political figure of the CS) declared as early as [[12 March]]: &quot;The Viennese Catholics should thank the Lord for the bloodless way this great political change has occurred, and they should pray for a great future for Austria. Needless to say, everyone should obey the orders of the new institutions.&quot; The other Austrian bishops followed suit some days later. [[Vatican Radio]], however, immediately broadcast a vehement denunciation of the German action, and Cardinal [[Pius XII|Pacelli]] ordered Innitzer to report to Rome. Before meeting with the pope, Innitzer met with Pacelli, who had been outraged by Innitzer's statement. He made it clear that Innitzer needed to retract; he was made to sign a new statement, issued on behalf of all the Austrian bishops, which provided: ''‚ÄúThe solemn declaration of the Austrian bishops ... was clearly not intended to be an approval of something that was not and is not compatible with God's law‚Äù''. The Vatican newspaper also reported that the bishops' earlier statement had been issued without the approval from Rome.

Robert Kauer, President of the [[Protestants]] in Austria, greeted Hitler on [[13 March]] as &quot;saviour of the 350,000 German Protestants in Austria and liberator from a five-year hardship.&quot; Even [[Karl Renner]], the most famous Social Democrat of the First Republic announced his support for the Anschluss and appealed to all Austrians to vote in favour of it on [[10 April]].{{ref|wienerzeitung_c}}

The international response to the expansion of Germany may be described as ''moderate''. ''[[The Times]]'' commented that 200 years ago Scotland had joined England as well and that this event would not really differ much. On [[14 March]] the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] noted in the [[House of Commons]]:

[[Image:Neville Chamberlain2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|British [[appeasement]] policy led to the [[Treaty of Munich]], the next major step for [[Hitler]] to create an all-German Reich]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His Majesty's Government have throughout been in the closest touch with the situation. The Foreign Secretary saw the German Foreign Minister on the 10th&amp;nbsp;of March and addressed to him a grave warning on the Austrian situation and upon what appeared to be the policy of the German Government in regard to it. . . . Late on the 11th&amp;nbsp;of March our Ambassador in Berlin registered a protest in strong terms with the German Government against such use of coercion, backed by force, against an independent State in order to create a situation incompatible with its national independence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However the speech concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I imagine that according to the temperament of the individual the events which are in our minds to-day will be the cause of regret, of sorrow, perhaps of indignation. They cannot be regarded by His Majesty's Government with indifference or equanimity. They are bound to have effects which cannot yet be measured. The immediate result must be to intensify the sense of uncertainty and insecurity in Europe. Unfortunately, while the policy of appeasement would lead to a relaxation of the economic pressure under which many countries are suffering to-day, what has just occurred must inevitably retard economic recovery and, indeed, increased care will be required to ensure that marked deterioration does not set in. This is not a moment for hasty decisions or for careless words. We must consider the new situation quickly, but with cool judgement... As regards our defence programmes, we have always made it clear that they were flexible and that they would have to be reviewed from time to time in the light of any development in the international situation. It would be idle to pretend that recent events do not constitute a change of the kind that we had in mind. Accordingly we have decided to make a fresh review, and in due course we shall announce what further steps we may think it necessary to take. {{ref|speech}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The lenient reaction to the Anschluss was the first major consequence of the strictly followed [[appeasement]] British foreign policy strategy. The international reaction on the events of [[March 12]]th 1938 led Hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his ''roadmap'' to expand the [[Third Reich]], as he would later in annexing the [[Sudetenland]]. The relatively bloodless Anschluss helped pave the way for the [[Treaty of Munich]] in September 1938 and the annexation of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, because it reinforced [[appeasement]] as the right way for Britain to deal with Hitler's [[Germany]].

==Legacy of the 1938 Anschluss==
===The Anschluss: annexation or union?===
Some historical sources, for instance [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] and the [[Encarta|Encarta Encyclopedia]] describe the Anschluss as an &quot;annexation&quot; {{ref|encarta_sidebar}}. Outside this context &quot;Anschluss&quot; is properly translated as &quot;join&quot;, &quot;connection&quot;, &quot;[[unification]]&quot; or &quot;political union&quot;. The German word &quot;Annektierung&quot; would mean military annexation unambiguously. However, the word commonly used in German for the process of spring 1938 is ''Anschluss''.

The precise character of the Anschluss remains a difficulty essential to Austria's understanding of its history and the obligations it entails.

===The appeal of Nazism to Austrians===
The Anschluss can be misunderstood as ''simply'' a military annexation of an unwilling Austria, but this lends itself to confusion with other German military occupations of European countries. It also tends to conceal the culpability of many Austrians in Nazi crimes, most of all the [[Holocaust]], by perpetuating the myth of Austria as the first victim of Hitler's expansionism. Despite the subversion of Austrian political process by Hitler's sympathisers and associates in Austria, Austrian acceptance of direct government by Hitler's Berlin is a very different phenomenon from the administration of other collaborationist countries.

With the break-up of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] in 1918, popular opinion was for unification with Germany, in realization of the [[Grossdeutschland]] concept- this however was forbidden by the [[Treaty of St. Germain]], to which the newly formed Austrian republic was obliged. This was in stark contrast to the general concept of [[self-determination]] which governed the  [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles talks]], as was the inclusion of the [[Sudetenland]], a German-populated area of the former Austro-Hungarian province of [[Bohemia]] (whose population favoured joining German-speaking Austria), in the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] republic, giving rise to [[revisionism|revisionist]] sentiment. This laid the grounds for the general willingness of the populations of both Austria and the Sudetenland for inclusion into the [[Third Reich]], as well as the relative acceptance of the Western Governments, who made little protest until March 1939, when the [[irredentism|irredentist]] argument lost its value following the annexation of the rest of Czech-speaking Bohemia, as well as Moravia and Czech Silesia.
[[Image:Grossdeutschland.jpg|thumb|right|Nazi propaganda poster]]

The small Republic of Austria was seen by many of its citizens as economically unviable, a feeling that was exacerbated by the [[Great Depression|Depression]] of the 1930s. In contrast the Nazi dictatorship appeared to have found a solution to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Furthermore, the break-up had thrown Austria into a crisis of identity, and many Austrians, of both the left and the right, felt that Austria should be part of a larger German nation. 

Politically, Austria had not had the time to develop a strongly democratic society to resist the onslaught of [[totalitarianism]]. The final version of the First Republic's constitution had only lasted from 1929 to 1933. The [[First Republic]] was ridden by violent strife between the different political camps; the [[Christian Social Party]] were complicit in the murder of large numbers of adherents of the decidedly left-wing [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] by the police during the [[July Revolt of 1927]]. In fact, with the end of democracy in 1933 and the establishment of [[Austrofascism]], Austria had already purged its democratic institutions and instituted a dictatorship long before the Anschluss. There is thus little to distinguish radically the ''institutions'' of at least the post-1934 Austrian government before or after [[12 March]] [[1938]].

The members of the leading [[Christian Social Party]] were fervent Catholics, but not particularly [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]]. For instance [[Jew|Jews]] were not prohibited from exercising any profession, in sharp contrast to the [[Third Reich]]. Many prominent Austrian scientists, professors, and lawyers at the time were Jewish; in fact [[Vienna]], with its Jewish population of about 200,000, was considered a [[safe haven]] from 1933 to 1938 by many Jews who fled Nazi Germany. However, the Nazis' anti-Semitism found fertile soil in Austria. Anti-Semitic elements had emerged as a force in Austrian politics in the late nineteenth century, with the rise in prominence of figures such as [[Georg Ritter von Sch√∂nerer]] and [[Karl Lueger]] (who had influenced the young Hitler), and in the 1930s anti-Semitism was rampant, as Jews were a convenient scapegoat for economic problems.

In addition to the economic appeal of the Anschluss, the popular underpinning of Nazi politics as a total art form (the refinement of film propaganda exemplified by [[Leni Riefenstahl|Riefenstahl's]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and mythological [[aestheticism]] of a broadly conceived national destiny of the [[German people]] within a &quot;Thousand-Year Reich&quot;) gave the Nazis a massive advantage in advancing their claims to power. Moreover [[Austrofascism]] was less grand in its appeal than the choice between [[Stalin]] and [[Hitler]] to which many European intellectuals of the time believed themselves reduced by the end of the decade. Austria had effectively no alternative view of its historical mission when the choice was upon it. In spite of Dollfuss' and Schuschnigg's hostility to Nazi political ambitions, the Nazis succeeded in convincing many Austrians to accept what they viewed as the historical destiny of the German people rather than continue as part of a distinct sovereign nation.

===The Second Republic===
====The Moscow Declaration====
[[Image:Seyss-inquartmugshot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] [[1945]] mugshot for the [[Nuremberg Trials]].]]

The [[Moscow Declaration]] of 1943, signed by the [[United States of America]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], and the [[United Kingdom]] included a &quot;Declaration on Austria,&quot; which stated the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governments of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States of America are agreed that Austria, the first free country to fall a victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They regard the annexation imposed on Austria by Germany on [[15 March]] [[1938]], as null and void. They consider themselves as in no way bound by any charges affected in Austria since that date. They declare that they wish to see re-established a free and independent Austria and thereby to open the way for the Austrian people themselves, as well as those neighbouring States which will be face with similar problems, to find that political and economic security which is the only basis for lasting peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austria is reminded, however that she has a responsibility, which she cannot evade, for participation in the war at the side of Hitlerite Germany, and that in the final settlement account will inevitably be taken of her own contribution to her liberation. {{ref|moskauermemo}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To judge from the last paragraph and subsequent determinations at the [[Nuremberg Trial]], the Declaration was intended to serve as [[propaganda]] aimed at stirring Austrian resistance (although there are Austrians counted as [[Righteous Among the Nations]], there never was an effective Austrian armed resistance of the sort found in other countries under German occupation) more than anything else, although the exact text of the declaration is said to have a somewhat complex drafting history.{{ref|nybooks}} At Nuremberg [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] {{ref|seyss-inquart}} and [[Franz von Papen]] {{ref|vonpapen}}, in particular, were both indicted under count one (conspiracy to commit crimes against peace) specifically for their activities in support of the Austrian Nazi Party and the Anschluss, but neither was convicted of this count. In acquitting von Papen, the court noted that his actions were in its view political immoralities but not crimes under its charter. Seyss-Inquart was convicted of other serious war crimes, most of which took place in [[Poland]] and the [[Netherlands]], and was sentenced to death.

====Austrian identity and the &quot;victim theory&quot;====
[[Image:1heldeplatz.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heldenplatz, &quot;Day of the Austrian legion,&quot; [[2 April]] [[1938]].]]

After [[World War II]], many Austrians sought comfort in the myth of Austria as the Nazis' first victim. Although the Nazi party was promptly banned, Austria did not have the same thorough process of de-Nazification at the top of government which was imposed on Germany for a time. Lacking outside pressure for political reform, factions of Austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that the Anschluss was ''only'' an annexation at bayonet point.

This view of the events of 1938 has deep roots in the ten years of Allied occupation and the struggle to regain Austrian sovereignty: The ''victim theory'' played an essential role in the negotiations on the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Soviets, and by pointing to the Moscow Declaration Austrian politicians heavily relied on it to achieve a solution for Austria different from the division into East and West in Germany. The State Treaty, alongside with the subsequent Austrian declaration of permanent [[Neutral country|neutrality]] marked important milestones for the solidification of Austria's independent [[nation]]al identity during the following decades.

As Austrian politicians of the left and right attempted to reconcile their differences in order to avoid the violent conflict that had dominated the first republic, discussions of both Austrofascism and Austria's role in Nazism were largely avoided. Still, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (√ñVP) has advanced and still sometimes advances the argument that the establishment of the Dollfuss dictatorship was necessary in order to maintain Austrian independence, while the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] (SP√ñ) argues that the dictatorship stripped the country of the democratic resources necessary to repel Hitler.

====Political events====
For decades, the victim theory established in the Austrian mind remained largely undisputed. The Austrian public was only rarely forced to confront the legacy of the Third Reich (most notably during the events of 1965 concerning [[Taras Borodajkewycz]], a professor of economic history notorious for anti-Semitic remarks, when [[Ernst Kirchweger]], a concentration camp survivor, was killed by a right-wing protester during riots). It was not until the 1980s that Austrians were finally massively confronted with their past. The main catalyst for the start of a ''[[Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung]]'' was the so-called [[Kurt Waldheim|Waldheim affair]]. The Austrian reply to allegations during the 1986 Presidential election campaign that successful candidate and former [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] had been a member of the Nazi party and of the infamous [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] (he was later absolved of direct involvement in [[war crimes]]) was that scrutiny was an unwelcome intervention in the country's [[internal affairs]]. Despite the politicians' reactions to international criticism of Waldheim, the Waldheim affair started the first serious major discussion on Austria's past and the Anschluss.

Another main factor for Austria and its coming to terms with the past emerged in the 1980s: [[J√∂rg Haider]] and the rise of the [[FP√ñ]]. The party had combined elements of the [[pan-German]] right with free-market liberalism since its foundation in 1955, but after Haider had ascended to the party chairmanship in 1986, the liberal elements became increasingly marginalized while Haider began to openly use nationalist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. He was often criticised for tactics such as the ''v√∂lkisch'' (ethnic) definition of national interest (&quot;Austria for Austrians&quot;) and his apologism for Austria's past, notably calling members of the [[Waffen-SS]] &quot;men of honour&quot;. Following an enormous electoral rise in the 1990s peaking in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]], the FP√ñ, now purged of its liberal elements, entered a coalition with the [[√ñVP]] led by [[Wolfgang Sch√ºssel]] that met international condemnation in 2000. This coalition triggered the regular ''Donnerstagsdemonstrationen'' (Thursday demonstrations) in protest against the government, which took place on the [[Heldenplatz]], where Hitler had greeted the masses during the Anschluss. Haider's tactics and rhetoric, which were often criticised as sympathetic to Nazism, again forced Austrians to reconsider their relationship to the past.

But it is not [[J√∂rg Haider]] alone who has made questionable remarks on Austria's past: [[J√∂rg Haider]]'s coalition partner the current Chancellor [[Wolfgang Sch√ºssel]] in an interview with the [[Jerusalem Post]] as late as 2000 stated that Austria was the first victim of Hitler-Germany.{{ref|jerusalem}}

====Literature====
Tearing into the simplism of the ''victim theory'' and the time of the [[Austrofascism]], [[Thomas Bernhard|Thomas Bernhard's]] last play, ''Heldenplatz'', was highly controversial even before it appeared on stage in 1988, fifty years after Hitler's visit. Bernhard's achievement was to make the elimination of references to Hitler's reception in Vienna emblematic of Austrian attempts to claim their history and culture under questionable criteria. Many politicians from all political factions called Bernhard a ''Nestbeschmutzer'' (so. damaging the reputation of his country) and openly demanded that the play should not be staged in Vienna's [[Burgtheater]]. [[Kurt Waldheim]], who was at that time still Austrian president called the play ''a crude insult to the Austrian people''.{{ref|bernhard}}

===The Historical Commission and outstanding legal issues===
In the context of the postwar [[Federal Republic of Germany]], one encounters a ''[[Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung]]'' (&quot;struggle to come to terms with the past&quot;) that has been partially institutionalised, variably in literary, cultural, political, and educational contexts (its development and difficulties have not been trivial; see, for example, the [[Historikerstreit]]). Austria formed a ''Historikerkommission''{{ref|historikerkommission}} (&quot;Historian's Commission&quot; or &quot;Historical Commission&quot;) in 1998 with a mandate to review Austria's role in the Nazi expropriation of Jewish property from a scholarly rather than legal perspective, partly in response to continuing criticism of its handling of property claims. Its membership was based on recommendations from various quarters, including [[Simon Wiesenthal]] and [[Yad Vashem]]. The Commission delivered its report in 2003. {{ref|report}} Noted Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] refused to participate in the Commission and in an interview stated his strenuous objections in terms both personal and in reference to larger questions about Austrian culpability and liability, comparing what he to be relative inattention to the settlement governing the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank holdings of those who died or were displaced by the Holocaust:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I personally would like to know why the WJC &amp;#91;[[World Jewish Congress]]&amp;#93; has hardly put any pressure on Austria, even as leading Nazis and SS leaders were Austrians, Hitler included... Immediately after the war, the US wanted to make the Russians withdraw from Austria, and the Russians wanted to keep Austria neutral, therefore there was a common interest to grant Austria victim status. And later Austria could cry poor - though its per capita income is as high as Germany's. And, most importantly, the Austrian PR machinery works better. Austria has the opera ball, the imperial castle, Mozartkugeln [a chocolate]. Americans like that. And Austrians invest and export relatively little to the US, therefore they are less vulnerable to blackmail. In the meantime, they set up a commission in Austria to clarify what happened to Jewish property. Victor Klima, the former chancellor, has asked me to join. My father fought for Austria in the First World War and in 1939 he was kicked out of Austria. After the war they offered him ten dollars per month as compensation. For this reason I told Klima, no thank you, this makes me sick. {{ref|Hilberg}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] continues to criticise Austria (as recently as June 2005) for its alleged historical and ongoing unwillingness aggressively to pursue investigations and trials against Nazis for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the seventies onwards. Its 2001 report offered the following characterization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Given the extensive participation of numerous Austrians, including at the highest levels, in the implementation of the Final Solution and other Nazi crimes, Austria should have been a leader in the prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators over the course of the past four decades, as has been the case in Germany. Unfortunately relatively little has been achieved by the Austrian authorities in this regard and in fact, with the exception of the case of Dr. Heinrich Gross which was suspended this year under highly suspicious circumstances (he claimed to be medically unfit, but outside the court proved to be healthy) not a single Nazi war crimes prosecution has been conducted in Austria since the mid-seventies.{{ref|Simon}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003 the Center launched a worldwide effort named &quot;Operation: Last Chance&quot; in order to collect further information about those Nazis still alive that are potentially subject to prosecution. Although reports issued shortly thereafter credited Austria for initiating large-scale investigations, there has been one case where criticism of Austrian authorities arose recently: The Center has put 92-year old [[Croatia]]n [[Milivoj Asner]] on its 2005 top ten list. Asner fled to Austria in 2004 after Croatia announced it would start investigations in the case of war crimes he may have been involved in. In response to objections about Asner's continued freedom, Austria's federal government has deferred to either extradition requests from Croatia or prosecutorial actions from [[Klagenfurt]], neither of which appears forthcoming (as of June 2005). {{ref|asner}} Extradition is not an option since Asner also holds Austrian [[citizenship]], having lived in the country from 1946 to 1991. {{ref|asner_citizen}}

The '''American Civil War''' (1861&amp;ndash;1865) was a [[civil war]] between the [[United States |United States of America]], called the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and the [[Confederate States of America]], formed by eleven [[Southern United States|Southern states]] that had [[secession|seceded]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Confederate States of America#International Diplomacy and Legal Status|[1]]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; from the Union. The Union won a decisive victory, followed by a period of [[Reconstruction]]. The war produced more than 970,000 casualties (3 percent of population), including approximately 560,000 deaths. The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for the outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]], are subjects of much controversy, even today. 



==Historiography: Multiple explanations of why War began ==
:''Main articles: [[Origins of the American Civil War]], [[Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War|Timeline of events]]''

The '''origin of the American Civil War''' lay in the complex issues of [[slavery]], [[Second Party System|politics]], disagreements over the scope of [[States' rights]] versus federal power, [[expansionism]], [[sectionalism]], economics, modernization, and competing nationalism of the [[Antebellum]] period.  Although there is little disagreement among historians on the details of the events that led to war, there is disagreement on exactly what caused what and the relative importance.  There is no consensus on whether the war could have been avoided, or if it should have been avoided.

===Failure to compromise===
In 1854 the old political system broke down after passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Whig Party disappeared, and the new [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] arose in its place. It was the nation's first major political party with only sectional appeal; though it had much of the old Whig economic platform, its popularity rested on its commitment to stop the expansion of slavery into new territories. Open warfare in the Kansas Territory, the [[panic of 1857]], and John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry further heightened sectional tensions and helped Republicans sweep elections in 1860. In 1860, [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|the election of Abraham Lincoln]], who met staunch opposition from Southern slave-owning interests, triggered Southern secession from the union. The new president decided to resort to arms, if necessary, to preserve the nation's territorial integrity.

Historians in the 1930s such as [[James G. Randall]] argued that the rise of mass democracy, the breakdown of the [[Second Party System|old two-party system]], and increasingly virulent and hostile sectional rhetoric made it highly unlikely, if not impossible, to bring about the compromises of the past (such as the [[Missouri Compromise]] and the [[Compromise of 1850]]) necessary to avoid crisis. Although numerous compromises were proposed, none were successful in reuniting the country.  One possible &quot;compromise&quot; was peaceful secession agreed to by the United States, which was seriously discussed in late 1860&amp;mdash;and supported by many abolitionists&amp;mdash;but was rejected by both Buchanan's conservative Democrats and the Republican leadership.

===Southern nationalism: Psychological nationhood===
Most historians agree, following [[Ulrich B. Phillips]], [[Avery Craven]], and [[Eugene Genovese]] that the South had grown apart from the North psychologically and in terms of its value systems.  One by one the common elements that bound the nation together were broken. For example the major Protestant denominations split along North-South lines. Fewer travelers or students or businessmen went from one region to the other. The last common elements were the Constitution (which was in dispute after the [[Dred Scott]] ruling of 1857); the political parties (which split along regional lines in 1860), and Congress, which was in constant turmoil after 1856.

===Slavery as a cause of the War===
Focus on the slavery issue has been cyclical. It was considered the main cause in the 1860&amp;ndash;1890 era. From 1900 to 1960, historians considered anti-slavery agitation to be less important than constitutional, economic, and cultural issues. Since the 1960s historians have returned to an emphasis on slavery as a major cause of the war. Specifically, they note that the South insisted on protecting it and the North insisted on weakening it. A small but militant abolitionist movement existed in the North--a matter of a few thousand advocates. Their insistence that slavery was a sin and slave owners were deeply guilty angered the South.  Historians have looked at many slave owners and decided that they felt neither guilt nor shame, but were angry at what they considered unchristian hate speech from abolitionists. By the 1830s there was a widespread ideological defense of the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; everywhere in the South. 

As [[United States territorial acquisitions|territorial expansion]] forced the nation to confront the question of whether new territories were to become &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;free,&quot; and as multiplying free states became a majority in the Union, the [[Slave Power]] in national politics waned. 

===Economics===
The North and South did have different economies but they were complementary and not in competition. The South made money by exporting cotton (and other unique crops like tobacco). The North made money by exporting food and manufactured items. Many northern business interests were closely tied to the Southern economy and pleaded for union and compromise.  Some Southerners thought they paid too much in tariffs--but they themselves had written and voted for the tariff laws in effect.

The cotton-growing export business  or &quot;[[King Cotton]],&quot; as it was touted, was so important to the world economy, southerners argued, that they could stand alone. Indeed, being tied to the North was a hindrance and an economic burden. The South would do better by trading directly with Europe and avoiding extortionate Yankee middlemen.

===Ideologies===
In the view of many northern Republicans, the [[Slave Power]] ruled the South, not democracy. This &quot;Slave Power&quot; was a small group of very wealthy slave owners, especially cotton planters, who dominated the politics and society of the South. However, historians more recently have emphasized that the South was much more democratic than the Republicans of North believed.
Both North and South believed strongly to republican values of democracy and civic virtue.  But their conceptualizations were diverging. Each side though the other was aggressive, and was violating both the Constitution and the core values of American republicanism.  Nationalism was the dominant force in Europe in the 19th century and likewise in America. The South was much more explicit in defining nationalism as a regional characteristic. The North paid less attention to nationalism before 1860, but then focused its mind on it and stressed the whole country, North and South, was the unit of nationalism. 

This economic differentiation had social and political consequences beyond the issue of slavery itself; for instance, Pennsylvania politicians pushed for a protective tariff to help the iron industry, while the cotton-exporting South wanted to keep the existing policy of nearly free trade. 

At a deeper level industrialization in the Northeast and farming in the Midwest depended on free labor, which could not exist alongside slave labor, as Lincoln kept emphasizing. The nation had to be all free or all slave, said Lincoln. 
(Historians [[Charles Beard|Charles and Mary Beard]] went so far as to argue in 1928 that this sectional conflict was a &quot;Second American Revolution&quot;&amp;mdash;a revolutionary watershed in the rise of modern industrial society in the United States.) 

===States Rights===
The States' rights debate cut across the issues. Southern politicians argued that the federal government had no power to prevent slaves from being carried into new territories, but they also demanded federal jurisdiction over slaves who escaped into the North; Northern politicians took reversed, though equally contradictory, stances on these issues.


===Slavery in the Territories===
The specific political crisis that culminated in secession and civil war stemmed from a dispute over the expansion of slavery into new territories. The reason was that Congress had power over slavery in the territories, but not in the states.  With new territories being formed--especially Kansas--the issue of slaver had to be confronted.  This argument grew out of the acquisition of vast new lands during the [[Mexican War]] (1846&amp;ndash;48). Free-state politicians such as David Wilmot, who personally had no sympathy for abolitionism, feared that slaves would provide too much competition for free labor, and thus effectively keep free-state migrants out of newly opened territories. Slaveholders felt that any ban on slaves in the territories was a discrimination against their peculiar form of property, and would undercut both the financial value of slaves and the institution itself. (Slaves comprised the second most valuable form of property in the South, after real estate.) In Congress, the end of the Mexican War was overshadowed by a fight over the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a provision that Wilmot tried (and failed) to enact to bar slavery from all lands acquired in the conflict.

The dispute led to open warfare after the [[Kansas]] Territory was organized in the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854. This act repealed the prohibition on slavery there under the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and put the fate of slavery in the hands of the territory's settlers, a process known as &quot;popular sovereignty.&quot; Proslavery Missourians expected that Kansas, due west of their state, would naturally become a slave state, and were alarmed by an organized migration of antislavery New Englanders. Soon heavily armed &quot;border ruffians&quot; from Missouri battled antislavery forces under [[John Brown]], among other leaders. Hundreds were killed or wounded. Southern congressmen, perceiving a Northern conspiracy to keep slavery out of Kansas, insisted that it be admitted as a slave state. Northerners, pointing to the large and growing majority of antislavery voters there, denounced this effort. By 1860, sectional divisions had grown deep and bitter.

===Southern fears of Modernity===
Southern secession was triggered by the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] because it was feared that he would make good on his promise to stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction.  If not Lincoln, then sooner or later another Yankee, many Southerners said; it was time to quit the Union. The slave states had lost the balance of power in the Electoral College and the Senate, and were facing a future as a perpetual minority. In a broader sense the North was rapidly modernizing its economy and its world view; slavery had no role in modern America. Historian James McPherson (1983 p 283) explains:

{{Quotation|When secessionists protested in 1861 that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values, they were correct. They fought to preserve their constitutional liberties against the perceived Northern threat to overthrow them. The South's concept of republicanism had not changed in three-quarters of a century; the North's had. ... The ascension to power of the Republican Party, with its ideology of competitive, egalitarian free-labor capitalism, was a signal to the South that the Northern majority had turned irrevocably towards this frightening, revolutionary future.|James McPherson|&quot;Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question,&quot; Civil War History 29 (Sept. 1983)}}

===Secession===
Before Lincoln took office, seven states seceded from the Union, and established an independent Southern government, the [[Confederate States of America]] on [[February 9]], [[1861]]. They took control of federal forts and property within their boundaries, with little resistance from President Buchanan. By seceding, the rebel states gave up any claim to the Western territories that were in dispute, canceled any obligation for the North to return fugitive slaves to the Confederacy, and assured easy passage in Congress of many bills and amendments they had long opposed. 

The Civil War began when, under orders from [[President of the Confederate States | Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], Confederate General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] opened fire upon [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on [[April 12]], [[1861]]. There were no casualties from enemy fire in this battle.

==Division of the country==
===The Union States ===	 
{{main|Union (American Civil War)}}	 
There were 23 Union States: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]]. The Union counted [[Virginia]] as well, and added [[Nevada]] and [[West Virginia]]. It added [[Tennessee]], [[Louisiana]], and other rebel states as soon as they were reconquered.	 
		 
The territories of [[Colorado Territory|Colorado]], [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Territory|Nevada]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Washington Territory|Washington]] also fought on the Union side. There was a civil war inside the [[Oklahoma territory]].

===The Confederacy===
{{main|Confederate States of America}}

Seven states seceded by March 1861: 
*[[South Carolina]] ([[December 21]] [[1860]]),
*[[Mississippi]] ([[January 9]] [[1861]]),
*[[Florida]] ([[January 10]] [[1861]]),
*[[Alabama]] ([[January 11]] [[1861]]),
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ([[January 19]] [[1861]]),
*[[Louisiana]] ([[January 26]] [[1861]]),
*[[Texas]] ([[February 1]] [[1861]]).

These states of the [[Deep South]], where [[slavery]] and [[cotton]] were most dominant, formed the Confederate States of America ([[February 4]] [[1861]]), with [[Jefferson Davis]] as president, and a governmental structure closely modeled on the [[U.S. Constitution]] ''(see also: [[Confederate States Constitution]])''. 
[[Image:Civilwarmap2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Map of the division of the states during the Civil War. Blue represents Union states; light blue, Union states that permitted [[Slavery in Colonial America|slavery]]; gray, Confederate states; green, Territories.]]
After the surrender of [[Fort Sumter]], [[April 13]], [[1861]], Lincoln called for troops from all states to put down the insurrection, resulting in the secession of four more states: 

*[[Virginia]] ([[April 17]] [[1861]]), 
*[[Arkansas]] ([[May 6]] [[1861]]), 
*[[North Carolina]] ([[May 20]] [[1861]]), and 
*[[Tennessee]] ([[June 8]] [[1861]]).

===Border states===
''Main article: [[Border states (Civil War)]]''

Along with the northwestern portion of Virginia (whose residents did not wish to secede and eventually entered the Union in 1863 as [[West Virginia]]), four of the five northernmost &quot;[[slave state]]s&quot; ([[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]]) did not secede, and became known as the [[Border States (Civil War)|Border States]]. There was considerable anti-war or &quot;[[Copperhead]]&quot; sentiment in the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and some men volunteered for Confederate service; however much larger numbers, led by [[John A. Logan]], joined the Union army.

[[Maryland]] had numerous pro-Confederate officials, but after [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and other events had prompted a Federal declaration of [[martial law]], Union troops moved in, and arrested the pro-Confederates.  Both [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] remained in the Union, but factions within each state organized governments in exile that were recognized by the CSA.

In Missouri, an elected convention on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. However, pro-Southern Governor [[Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, which was attacked in St. Louis by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. (''See also: [[Missouri secession]]'').

[[Image:Map of CSA 3.png|thumb|300px|Map of territory claimed by the Confederacy]]

Although Kentucky did not secede, for a time it declared itself [[neutral]]. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Southern sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a Confederate Governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. However, the military occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky | Columbus]] by Confederate General [[Leonidas Polk]] in September 1861 turned general popular opinion in Kentucky against the Confederacy, and the state subsequently reaffirmed its loyal status and expelled the Confederate government. 

Residents of the northwestern counties of Virginia organized a secession from Virginia and entered the Union in 1863 as [[West Virginia]]. Similar secessions were supported in some other areas of the Confederacy (such as eastern [[Tennessee]]), but were suppressed by declarations of martial law by the Confederacy. 
&lt;!-- California not unique in having split sentiments
[[History of California#California and the Civil War|California]] was a [[free state]] and a part of the Union. Lincoln had won a [[plurality]] there, but there were a number of Southern sympathizers. 2% of its votes went to the Southern Democrat candidate, [[John C. Breckinridge]]. California's soldiers were kept under state control and were used to keep the land routes between the Mississippi and the state open. California gold helped finance the Union war effort.[http://www.militarymuseum.org/HistoryCW.html]

==Narrative summary: 1861 to Fort Sumter==
[[Image:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|right|350px|Battles of the American Civil War by Theater, Year]]
Lincoln's victory in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered South Carolina's secession from the Union. By [[February 1]], [[1861]], six more Southern states had seceded. On [[February 7]], the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their capital at [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The pre-war February [[peace conference of 1861]] met in Washington, as one last attempt to avoid war; it failed. The remaining southern states as yet remained in the Union. Confederate forces seized all but three federal forts within their boundaries (they did not take Fort Sumter); President Buchanan made no military response, but governors in Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania began secretly buying weapons and training militia units to ready them for immediate action.

On [[March 4]], [[1861]], Abraham Lincoln was sworn in. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a ''more perfect union'' than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called the secession &quot;legally void&quot;. He stated he had no intent to invade southern states, but would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union. The South did send delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties, but they were turned down. Lincoln refused to negotiate with any Confederate agents because he insisted the Confederacy was not a legitimate government. 

On [[April 12]], Confederate soldiers fired upon the Federal troops stationed at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], until the troops surrendered. Lincoln called for all of the states in the Union to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union. Most Northerners hoped that a quick victory for the Union would crush the nascent rebellion, and so Lincoln only called for volunteers for 90 days. Four states, Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and&amp;mdash;most importantly, Virginia&amp;mdash;which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures now decided that they could not send forces against the seceding states. They seceded and to reward Virginia the Confederate capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]], a highly vulnerable location at the end of the supply line.

Even though the Southern states had seceded, there was considerable anti-secessionist sentiment within several of the seceding states. Eastern Tennessee, in particular, was a hotbed for pro-Unionism. [[Winston County, Alabama]] issued a resolution of secession from the state of Alabama. The ''[[Red Strings (American politics)|Red Strings]]'' were a prominent Southern anti-secession group.

[[Winfield Scott]] created the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a [[Union blockade]] would strangle the rebel economy, then capture of the Mississippi would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan but overruled  Scott's warnings against an immediate attack on Richmond.

===Naval war and blockade===
{{see details|Naval Battles of the American Civil War}}[[Union blockade]] and [[Confederate States Navy]]
In May 1861 Lincoln proclaimed the [[Union blockade]] of all southern ports, which shut down nearly all international traffic and most local port-to-port traffic. Although few naval battles were fought and few men were killed, the blockade shut down [[King Cotton]] and ruined the southern economy.  British investors built small, very fast &quot;blockade runners&quot; that brought in military supplies (and civilian luxuries) from Cuba and the Bahamas and took out some cotton and tobacco. When the blockade captured one the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the Union sailors. The crews were British, so when they were captured they were released and not held as prisoners of war. The most famous naval battle was the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] (often called &quot;the Battle of the ''Monitor'' and the ''Merrimac''&quot;) in March 1862, in which Confederate efforts to break the blockade were frustrated. Other naval battles included [[Battle of Island Number Ten | Island No. 10]], [[Battle of Memphis | Memphis]], [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff | Drewry's Bluff]], [[Battle of Fort Hindman | Arkansas Post]], and [[Battle of Mobile Bay | Mobile Bay]].

===Eastern Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1863===
{{see details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}
Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia]], in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'', whereupon they were forced back to [[Washington, D.C.]], by Confederate troops under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and P.G.T. Beauregard. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the name of &quot;Stonewall&quot; because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on [[July 25]] of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end [[slavery]].

Major General [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on [[July 26]] (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in [[1862]].

Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan invaded Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]] halted his advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], then [[Robert E. Lee]] defeated him in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat. McClellan was stripped of many of his troops to reinforce [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s Union [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope was beaten spectacularly by Lee in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] and the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in August.

[[Image:conf_dead_chancellorsville.jpg|thumb|300px|Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863.]]

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 55,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into [[Maryland]] on [[September 5]]. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]], on [[September 17]] [[1862]], the bloodiest single day in American history. Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided justification for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside suffered near-immediate defeat at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] on [[December 13]] [[1862]], when over ten thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker|Joseph &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker]]. Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] ([[July 1]]&amp;ndash;[[July 3|3]], [[1863]]), the largest battle in North American history, which is sometimes considered the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000), again forcing it to retreat to Virginia, never to launch a full-scale invasion of the North again. Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.

===Western Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1863===
{{see details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they crucially failed in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]]. [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Kentucky]] enraged the citizens there who previously had declared neutrality in the war, turning that state against the Confederacy.

[[Nashville, Tennessee]], fell to the Union early in 1862. Most of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], was captured in May 1862, allowing the Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi as well. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], prevented unchallenged Union control of the entire river.

[[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky was repulsed by [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the confused and bloody [[Battle of Perryville]] and he was narrowly defeated by [[William S. Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in [[Tennessee]].

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], near the [[Tennessee]] border, where Bragg, reinforced by the corps of [[James Longstreet]] (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of [[George Henry Thomas]], and forced him to retreat to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the west was Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at: Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]], by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River |Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers; [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]]; the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], cementing Union control of the Mississippi River and considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War |turning points]] of the war; and the  [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Battle of Chattanooga, Tennessee]], driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening an invasion route to [[Atlanta, Georgia |Atlanta]] and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1865===
{{see details| Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}
Though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, a number of small-scale military actions took place west of the Mississippi River. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico were repulsed in 1862. Guerilla activity turned much of Missouri and Indian Territory (Oklahoma) into a battleground. Late in the war the Federal [[Red River Campaign]] was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off after the capture of [[Vicksburg]] in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

===End of the War 1864&amp;ndash;1865===
[[Image:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jefferson Davis]], first and only President of the Confederate States of America]]

At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war.  He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals Grant, Meade, and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] would move against Lee near Richmond; General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) would [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|invade the Shenandoah Valley]]; General Sherman would and capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea; Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] would operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]]; and General [[Nathaniel Prentiss Banks|Nathaniel Banks]] would capture [[Mobile, Alabama]].

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (&quot;Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]&quot;) of the Eastern campaign. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign | Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 66,000 casualties in six weeks), kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan proved to be more than a match for [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], and defeated him in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]], Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Valley, a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman would later employ in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman marched from [[Chattanooga]] to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John B. Hood]]. The fall of Atlanta, on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the re-election of Abraham Lincoln, as President of the Union. Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unclear destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his celebrated &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;, and reaching the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] in December 1864. Burning plantations as they went, Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves.  When Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Virginia lines from the south, it was the end for Lee and his men, and for the Confederacy.

Lee attempted to escape from the besieged Petersburg and link up with Johnston in [[North Carolina]], but he was overtaken by Grant. He surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on [[April 9]], [[1865]], at [[Appomattox Court House]]. Johnston surrendered his troops to Sherman shortly thereafter at a [[Bennett Place|local family's farmhouse]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. The [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought on [[May 13]], [[1865]], in the far south of [[Texas]], was the last Civil War land battle and ended, ironically, with a Confederate victory. All Confederate land forces surrendered by June 1865.

==Analysis of the outcome==
Why the Union prevailed (or why the Confederacy was defeated) in the Civil War has been a subject of extensive analysis and debate. 

Could the South have won? A significant number of scholars believe that the Union held an insurmountable advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength, population, and the determination to win. Confederate actions, they argue, could only delay defeat. Southern historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly in Ken Burns's television series on the Civil War: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back.... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot; [Ward 1990 p 272]

Other historians, however, suggest that the South had a chance to win its independence.  As James McPherson has observed, the Confederacy remained on the defensive, which required fewer military resources. The Union, committed to the strategic offensive, faced enormous manpower demands that it often had difficulty meeting.  War weariness among Union civilians mounted along with casualties, in the long years before Union advantages proved decisive. Thus, the inevitability of Union victory remains hotly contested among scholars.

The goals were not symmetric. To win independence the South had to convince the North it could not win, but it did not have to invade the North. To restore the Union the North had to conquer vast stretches of territory. In the short run (a matter of months) the two sides were evenly matched. But in the long run (a matter of years) the North had advantages that increasingly came into play.

Both sides had long-term advantages but the Union had more of them. The Union had to control the entire coastline, defeat all the main Confederate armies, seize Richmond, and control most of the population centers. As the occupying force they had to station hundreds of thousands of soldiers to control railroads, supply lines, and major towns and cites. The long-term advantages widely credited by historians to have contributed to the Union's success include:
[[Image:Advantages.jpg|right|350px|US economic advantages over CSA]]
*The more industrialized economy of the North, which aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The graph shows the relative advantage of the USA over the CSA.
*A [[Second Party System| party system]] that enabled the Republicans to mobilize soldiers and support at the grass roots, even when the war became unpopular. The Confederacy deliberately did not use parties.
*The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. 
*Excellent railroad links between Union cities, which allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller system or repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. 
*The Union devoted much more of its resources to medical needs, thereby overcoming the unhealthy disease environment that sickened (and killed) more soldiers than combat did.
*The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. 
*The Union's more established government, particularly a mature executive branch which accumulated even greater power during wartime, may have resulted in less regional infighting and a more streamlined conduct of the war. Failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors damaged the Confederate president's ability to draw on regional resources.
*The Confederacy's tactic of engaging in major battles at the cost of heavy manpower losses, when it could not easily replace its losses.  
*The Confederacy's [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HZY/is_1_14/ai_78397581 failure] to fully use its advantages in guerrilla warfare against Union communication and transportation infrastructure.  However, as Lee warned, such warfare would prove devastating to the South, and (with the exception of Confederate partisans in Missouri) Confederate leaders shrank from it.
*Despite the Union's many tactical blunders like the [[Seven Days Battle]], those commited by Confederate generals, such as Lee's miscalculations at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam]], were far more serious&amp;mdash;if for no other reason than that the Confederates could so little afford the losses.  
*Lincoln proved more adept than Davis in replacing unsuccessful generals with better ones. 
*Strategically the location of the capital Richmond tied Lee to a highly exposed position at the end of supply lines. (Loss of Richmond, everyone realized, meant loss of the war.) 
*Lincoln grew as a grand strategist, in contrast to Davis. The Confederacy never developed an overall strategy. It never had a plan to deal with the blockade. Davis failed to respond in a coordinated fashion to serious threats, such as Grant's campaign against Vicksburg in 1863 (in the face of which, he allowed Lee to invade Pennsylvania).
*The Confederacy's failure to win diplomatic or military support from any foreign powers. Its [[King Cotton]] misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. 
* Most important, the Union had the will to win, and leaders like Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Grant, and Sherman would do whatever it took to achieve victory. The Confederacy, as Beringer et al (1986) argue, may have lacked the total commitment needed to win. It took time, however, for leaders such as Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan to emerge; in the meantime, Union public opinion wavered, and Lincoln worried about losing the election of 1864, until victories in the Shenandoah Valley and Atlanta made victory seem likely.

==Major land battles==
There were as many as 10,000 hostile engagements during the war. The costliest and most significant are listed in [[Battles of the American Civil War]].

One of the reasons that the U.S. Civil War wore on as long as it did and the battles were so fierce was that most important generals on both sides had formerly served in the [[United States Army]]&amp;mdash;some, including [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Robert E. Lee]], during the [[Mexican-American War]] between 1846 and 1848. Most were graduates of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.
Southern military commanders and strategists included [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]], [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]], [[James Longstreet]], [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], [[John Mosby]], [[Braxton Bragg]], [[John Bell Hood]], [[JEB Stuart|James Ewell Brown (JEB) Stuart]], [[William Mahone]], [[Judah P. Benjamin]], [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].

Northern military commanders and strategists included [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[George H. Thomas]], [[George B. McClellan]], [[Henry W. Halleck]], [[Joseph Hooker]], [[Ambrose Burnside]], [[Irvin McDowell]], [[Winfield Scott]], [[Philip Sheridan]], [[George Crook]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[George G. Meade]], and [[Winfield Hancock]]

After 1980, scholarly attention turned to ordinary soldiers, and to women and African Americans involved with the War. As James McPherson observed &quot;The profound irony of the Civil War was that Confederate and Union soldiers ... interpreted the heritage of 1776 in opposite ways. Confederates fought for liberty and independence from what they regarded as a tyrannical government; Unionists fought to preserve the nation created by the founders from dismemberment and destruction.&quot;(McPherson 1994 p 24)

==The Question of Slavery==
Given the painfulness of the historical memory of slavery for many Americans, its role in the war remains controversial to this day. To understand its place in the conflict, it is necessary to divide the issue in two: slavery as a motivation for secession, and abolition as a Union war aim.

In the weeks and months preceding the secession of the Confederate states, Southern leaders spoke openly about their desire to preserve slavery, and their fears for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; if the South remained within the Union. Almost all of the ordinances of secession cited the preservation of slavery as a primary, even the foremost, reason for departure from the Union. And yet many individual Southern soldiers fought for reasons quite apart from the defense of slavery: to protect their families and communities, to defend their home states, and out of a nascent sense of nationality. 

On the Union side, Lincoln initially declared his purpose in prosecuting the war to be the preservation of the Union, not emancipation. He had no wish to alienate the thousands of slaveholders in the Union border states. The long war, however, had a radicalizing effect on federal policies. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced in September 1862 and put into effect four months later, Lincoln adopted the abolition of the [[Slave Power]] as a second mission&amp;mdash;that is slaves owned by rebels had to be taken away from them and freed. One goal was to destroy the economic basis of the Confederate leadership class, and another goal was to actually liberate the 4 million slaves, which was accomplished by 1865.

The Emancipation Proclamation declared all slaves held in territory then under Confederate control  to be &quot;then, thenceforth, and forever free,&quot; but did not affect slaves in areas under Union control. It did, however, show the Union that slavery's days were numbered, increasing abolitionist support in the North. The border states (except Kentucky) abolished slavery on their own.

==Foreign diplomacy==
Because of the Confederacy's attempt to create a new state, recognition and support from the European powers were critical to its prospects. The Union, under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward]] attempted to block the Confederacy's efforts in this sphere. The Confederates hoped that the importance of the cotton trade to Europe (the idea of [[cotton diplomacy]]) and shortages caused by the war, along with early military victories, would enable them to gather increasing European support and force a turn away from neutrality.

President Lincoln's decision to announce a [[Union blockade|blockade of the Confederacy]], a clear act of war, enabled Britain, followed by other European powers, to announce their neutrality in the dispute. This enabled the Confederacy to begin to attempt to gain support and funds in Europe. President Jefferson Davis had picked [[Robert Toombs]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as his first Secretary of State. Toombs, having little knowledge in foreign affairs, was replaced several months later by [[Robert M. T. Hunter]] of [[Virginia]], another choice with little suitability. Ultimately, on [[March 17]], [[1862]], Davis selected [[Judah P. Benjamin]] of [[Louisiana]] as Secretary of State, who although having more international knowledge and legal experience with international slavery disputes still failed in the end to create a dynamic foreign policy for the Confederacy.

The first attempts to achieve European recognition of the Confederacy were dispatched on [[February 25]], [[1861]] and led by [[William Lowndes Yancey]], [[Pierre A. Rost]], and [[Ambrose Dudley Mann]]. The British foreign minister [[Lord John Russell]] met with them, and the French foreign minister [[Edouard Thouvenel]] received the group unofficially. However, at this point, the two countries had agreed to coordinate and cooperate and would not make any rash moves.

[[Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as ambassador to Britain for the Union, and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the Union's blockade. The Confederacy also attempted to initiate propaganda in Europe through journalists [[Henry Hotze]] and [[Edwin De Leon]] in [[Paris]] and [[London]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain. A significant challenge in Anglo-Union relations was also created by the [[Trent Affair]], involving the Union boarding of a British mail steamer to seize [[James M. Mason]] and [[John Slidell]], Confederate diplomats sent to Europe. However, the Union was able to smooth over the problem to some degree.

As the war continued, in late 1862, the British considered initiating an attempt to mediate the conflict. However, the Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. Additionally, the issuing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. As the war continued, the Confederacy's chances with Britain grew more hopeless, and they focused increasingly on France. [[Napol√©on III]] proposed to offer mediation in January 1863, but this was dismissed by Seward. Despite some sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [[French intervention in Mexico|concerns in Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from substantially antagonizing the Union. As the Confederacy's situation grew more and more tenuous and their pleas increasingly ignored, President Davis sent [[Duncan F. Kenner]] to Europe, in November 1864, to test whether a promised Confederate emancipation of its slaves could lead to possible recognition. The proposal was strictly rejected by both Britain and France.

==Aftermath==
{{main|Reconstruction}}
[[Image:Peace_Monument_Chattanooga.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Peace Monument'' at [[Lookout Mountain]], [[Tennessee]] depicts a Union and Confederate soldier shaking hands.]]
Northern leaders agreed that the war would be over when Confederate nationalism was dead, and slavery was dead.  They disagreed sharply on how to identify these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control that should be imposed on the South. 
The fighting ended with the surrender of all the Confederate forces. There was no significant guerrilla warfare.  Many senior Confederate leaders escaped to Europe, but Davis was captured and imprisoned, but never brought to trial. The question became how much the Union could trust the ex-Confederates to be truly loyal to the United States. The second main question in Reconstruction dealt with the destruction of slavery. The XIII Amendment (1865) officially abolished it legally, but the issue was whether [[black codes]] indicated a sort of semi-slavery, and whether Freedmen should have the vote to protect those rights. 
In 1867 Radicals in Congress pushed aside President Johnson and imposed new rules. Freedmen gained the right to vote and formed Republican political coalitions that took control of each state for varying periods. One by one the white conservatives or &quot;[[Redeemers]]&quot; gained back control of their states, often through lethal force. The final three were redeemed by the [[Compromise of 1877]]. After that the hatreds between North and South rapidly diminished until by 1900 the nation was no longer divided by the war, though it did remain divided by race.

Ghosts of the conflict still persist in America. For decades after the war, Northern politicians &quot;waved the bloody shirt,&quot; bringing up memories of the Civil War as an electoral tactic, while the &quot;solid South&quot; as a block in national politics was built on memories of the war and a determination to maintain segregation.  The [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s had its [[neoabolitionist]] roots in the failure of Reconstruction. A few debates surrounding the legacy of the war continue, especially regarding memorials and celebrations of Confederate heroes and [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Controversy|battle flags]]. The question is a deep and troubling one: Americans with Confederate ancestors cherish the memory of their bravery and determination, yet their cause remains one ultimately tied to the shameful history of African American slavery.

'''Andy Warhol''' ([[August 6]], [[1928]] ‚Äì [[February 22]], [[1987]]) was an [[United States|American]] painter, filmmaker, publisher, actor, and a major figure in the [[Pop Art]] movement.

== Biography ==
Warhol was born as '''Andrew Warhola''' in [[Forest City, Pennsylvania]]. His parents, Ondrej (Andrew) Warhola and Julia Zavacky, were working class immigrants of [[Rusyns|Ruthenian ethnicity]] from [[Mikova]], in northeast [[Slovakia]]; his father worked in the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]]. The family was [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] but Warhol's mother had a [[Jewish]] grandmother.[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0815410085/qid=1141095641/sr=1-33/ref=sr_1_33/104-6359540-7548710?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155]

Warhol showed early artistic talent and studied [[commercial art]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1949 he moved to [[New York City]] and began a successful career in [[magazine]] illustration and [[advertising]]. He became well-known mainly for his whimsical ink drawings of shoes done in a loose, blotted style.

In the 1960s, Warhol began to make paintings of famous American products such as [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's soup]] cans and [[Coca-Cola]]. He switched to [[silkscreen]] prints, seeking not only to make art of mass produced items, but to mass produce the art itself. He said that he wanted to be like a robot. He hired and supervised &quot;art workers&quot; engaged in making prints, shoes, films, books and other items at his studio, ''[[The Factory]]'', located on [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] in New York City. Warhol's body of work furthermore includes commissioned portraits and commercials.

A lot of Warhol's works revolve around the concept of [[Americana]] and American culture. He painted money, dollar signs, food, groceries, women's shoes, celebrities, and newspaper clippings. To him, these subjects represented American cultural values. For instance, Coca-Cola represents democratic equality because

:&quot;What‚Äôs great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&quot; 

He used popular imagery and methods to visualize the American cultural identity of the 20th century.  This popular redefinition of American culture is a theme and result of Warhol's art. Because American culture has had great international influence, Warhol did as well.

Outside of the art world, Andy Warhol is best known for saying that &quot;In the future, everyone will be world famous for [[15 minutes of fame|15 minutes]].&quot;  He later told reporters, humorously, &quot;My new line is, 'In fifteen minutes everybody will be famous.'&quot;

=== Socialite and Recluse ===
Warhol used to socialize at [[Serendipity (nightclub)|Serendipity]] and [[Studio 54]], nightclubs in New York City. Warhol was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and as a meticulous observer. More than one person jokingly referred to him as &quot;death warmed over.&quot; 

Warhol was openly gay, rare for celebrities of his stature at the time. Many people think of Warhol as [[asexual]] and as merely a [[voyeur]], but these notions have been debunked by biographers (like [[Fred Guiles]]), scholars (e.g. [[Richard Meyer]]), personal accounts of relationships by ex-lovers such as Jed Johnson and Billy Name, and by the overtly campy and homoerotic nature of his work itself. Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minelli]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films like &quot;My Hustler&quot;, &quot;[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]&quot;, and &quot;Lonesome Cowboys&quot;) draw from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire.  In fact, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.  The first works that he submitted to a gallery in the pursuit of a career as an artist were, in fact, homoerotic drawings of male nudes. They were rejected for being too openly gay.

A meticulous collector, he organized almost every piece of paper, fan mail&amp;mdash;after taking off the stamps&amp;mdash;and magazine related to his fame along with personal notes, gay pornography and found artifacts into hundreds of numbered boxes and set them aside, never to open them again. Warhol referred to these boxes as his &quot;time capsule&quot;. Many exist today and are available for research at his Pittsburgh [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|museum]].  Warhol's house was filled to the brim with his collected art, artifacts, and Americana.

Many of his later commissioned portraits were a direct or indirect result of this networking. As a famous artist, Warhol and his Factory attracted and facilitated many &quot;groupies&quot; and friends that Warhol would include in films and happenings. Warhol promoted these [[the factory|factory]] regulars to fame, creating the [[Warhol superstars]]. They would appear in and help him make his work, play in his movies, write his books, hang out and generally become his following. 

When Warhol was asked to give a series of university lectures that he didn't feel like doing, one of his friends put on a wig and white make-up, and pretended to be him by sitting quietly on the stage. Other Superstars explained Warhol's work to the audience, and urged them to drop out of college. The University eventually found out Warhol's &quot;fraud&quot; and the following dispute had to be settled with a refund.

Warhol would regularly volunteer at the homeless shelters in New York, particularly during the busier times of the year. He described himself as a religious person, although not fully accepted by religion because of his homosexuality. Many of his later works contain almost hidden religious themes or subjects, and a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.

=== Shooting ===
On [[June 3]], [[1968]], [[Valerie Solanas]], a [[The Factory|Factory]] regular, entered Warhol's studio and fired three shots at Warhol, nearly killing him. Although the first two rounds missed, the third passed through Warhol's left [[lung]], [[spleen]], [[stomach]], [[liver]], [[esophagus]], and right lung. Solanas then turned the gun on a companion of Warhol, Mario Amaya, injuring his thigh. Warhol survived his injuries, but he never fully recovered. Earlier, Solanas had given a script to Warhol, in hopes that he would make a film out of it. Warhol never did.  Apparently, she had visited the Factory earlier in the day to ask that they give the script back to her.  It had, however, been lost.  She later explained that she had attacked Warhol because, &quot;he had too much control over [her] life.&quot; The story of Valerie Solanas was made into the 1996 film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'', starring [[Lili Taylor]] and directed by [[Mary Harron]].

In the hospital, his doctors had already declared him deceased, after which he was resuscitated. Warhol later joked that he was now invulnerable, since he had gone through death and came out alive. The shooting and Warhol's &quot;death&quot; received wide media coverage.

One of Warhol's associates, [[Paul Morrissey]], later satirized the event in his movie [[&quot;Women In Revolt&quot;]], calling a group similar to Solanas' [[S.C.U.M.]] ('''Society for Cutting Up Men'''), ''P.I.G.'' ('''Politically Involved Girls''').

In [[1990 in music|1990]] [[Lou Reed]] recorded the album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' (one of Warhol's nicknames was Drella, a combination of Dracula and Cinderella) with fellow [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] alumnus [[John Cale]].

Warhol had adopted Reed's band the Velvet Underground as one of his projects in the 1960s, &quot;producing&quot; their first album [[The Velvet Underground and Nico]] as well as providing the album art, widely regarded as some of the greatest album art of all time. The album itself is also regarded as one of the greatest (and most influential) albums in rock history. After the band became successful Warhol and band leader Reed started to disagree more and more about the direction the band should take, and the contact between them faded. On the album, Reed apologizes and comes to terms with his part in their conflict.

=== Death ===
Warhol died in New York City following routine gallbladder surgery at the age of 58. Warhol was afraid of hospitals and doctors, so he had delayed having his recurring gall bladder problems checked.

He is interred at St. John the Baptist Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, south of Pittsburgh. Fellow artist [[Yoko Ono]] was among the speakers at his funeral.

Andy Warhol had so many posessions it took [[Sotheby's]] 9 days to auction his estate after his death for a total gross amount of over 20,000,000 (USD).

== Work ==
=== Paintings ===
When he decided to pursue a career as an artist, Warhol had already established a reputation as a commercial illustrator. In school he had made paintings, but his work afterwards had mainly consisted of &quot;blotted ink&quot; illustrations for warehouses and magazines. He felt that he was not being taken seriously as an illustrator, and wanted to become a &quot;real&quot; artist.

When he started painting, he looked to find a niche for himself. At that time Pop Art - as it was later to be called - was already experimented with by several artists turning away from abstract expressionism, and Warhol turned to this new way of making art, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's vocabulary. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, in a hand-painted style, with paint drips. He added these drips to give his paintings a &quot;serious&quot; feel, to emulate a bit of the style of the abstract expressionists, that were en vogue at the time, in other words to be taken seriously or to sell his paintings, which may have had the same meaning to Warhol.

To Warhol, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter. Cartoons were already being &quot;done&quot; by [[Roy Liechtenstein]], typography by [[Jasper Johns]], et-cetera; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject. His friends suggested that he should paint the things he loved the most. In his signature way of taking things literally, for his first major exhibition he painted his famous cans of Campbell's Soup, that he had for lunch most of his life. Warhol loved money, so he later painted money. He loved celebrities, so he painted them as well.

From these beginnings he developed his later style and themes. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the hand-made from the artistic process. Warhol went from painting to silk-screening, his later drawings were traced from slide projections. In other words, Warhol went from being a painter to being a designer of paintings. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, in different versions and variations after his directions.

It has been suggested by many that Warhol would just take images of things that were hip in his time and cover them in &quot;Warhol gravy&quot;, but for Warhol there was always a personal relation between him and his subjects. For instance the Campbell's Soup did not (only) function as an illustration of commercial industry and advertisement, it was an intrinsical part of Warhol's life and memories. As a child his mother had given him this soup when he was sick, and Warhol loved it very much as a grown up. For him (and many other Americans) the soup represented a feeling of being &quot;home&quot;.

Another criterion that is important in the way Warhol chose his subjects is that the subjects should also represent a more philosophical notion, should have a metaphorical quality. When Warhol paints money, he paints it because he wants to own it - canvases filled with money. Partly, his work was meant to provide him with this money (and success and fame and maybe even love). At the same time these paintings speak of art as a commercial commodity: the paintings of dollar bills represent monetary value as well, as investments. In this way, instead of merely depicting dollar bills, these paintings touch on notions like (artistic) value, or may be perceived as a comment on art practice.

Similarly, when Warhol paints photographs of disasters in bright colors (&quot;Red Car Crash&quot;, &quot;Purple Jumping Man&quot;, &quot;Orange Disaster&quot;) they point at the horror of the event in the picture, and its media value, but also at the way in which these images are trivialized by the media. By turning these &quot;random&quot; clippings into paintings, Warhol turns them into monuments for personal tragedies. As such they represent a personal experience as well as a social comment as well as an illustration of a time when the media grew to be more and more important.

On a personal level a lot of Warhol's work is motivational in nature, and speaks of notions like democracy, being able to change things, optimistic materialism, being heard. But Warhol wasn't naively optimistic about these things, his work also deals with loss, death, loneliness and the such.
Warhol knew how to juggle many levels of meaning and interpretation, and to combine these in seemingly simple, sometimes even dumb-looking works of art. In general his work has a very high &quot;Duh!&quot; level.
Although a bit of a generalization, it may be accurate to say that Warhol depicted highly his very personal approach to subjects that everyone knows, in a way that these subjects become symbolic.

Warhol's work became more and more conceptual and more reflective of art itself. His series of Do-It-Yourself-Paintings and Rorschach-blots are intended as pop-comments on art and what art could be. His Cow Wallpaper (literally wallpaper with a cow motif) and his Oxidation Paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that show oxidated urine stains) are also noteworthy in this context. Warhol later did a series of his old works in negative, as a comment on his own position as an artist.

In the beginning of his career Warhol worked on a growing oeuvre of American forms and values, newspaper clippings, disasters, money, commercial products, Coca-Cola bottles, postal stamps, movie stars, criminals, shoes, clothes, etc. defining a position, researching and making statements. As recognition -- and the value of his work -- grew, he went back to his roots as a commercial illustrator, and starts to take commissions, most noticeably for portraits. These are sometimes viewed as Warhol's sell-out (the revolutionary painter that became a jester), but it can also be argued that his self-supporting way of working fit his world-views. At any rate, his body of portraits -- that include many celebrities, athletes, movie stars, politicians, dictators, royalty, his mother, transvestites -- have became a document of an era. Having the money or the relations to be portrayed by Warhol meant that you might be able to enter into immortality. Warhol's commercial effort also include advertisements for Chanel, Apple and more.

There are three more periods that are noteworthy in Warhol's oeuvre as a painter.
His self-portraits, of which he made many, with his silver wig, painted over with camouflage print may represent Warhol studying his own identity. Warhol has spoken about himself and was spoken about as being empty, hollow, a reflection or a mirror. The second series is his paintings of shadows. These may represent Warhol's study of the abstract. Again there is a relation with Warhol personally, as he has also depicted himself as &quot;The Shadow,&quot; the character from the radio show. Thirdly, Warhol produced many &quot;portfolios,&quot; series of small paintings meant for commercial sale. These series would be grouped around a theme; for instance, &quot;famous Jews&quot;, &quot;cars&quot;, or &quot;animals&quot;.

At one point Warhol publicly declared that he had stopped being a painter, and that he would only make films from then on; but at the end of his life, Warhol took up painting again. His last paintings and drawings are of da Vinci's ''[[Last Supper]]'', which he was working on when he died.

=== Films ===
Warhol worked across a wide range of mediums - painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture.  He was also a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than sixty films. One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'' (1963), shows a man ([[John Giorno]], who had a relationship with Warhol) sleeping for eight hours. In the 35 minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' (1963), he shows the face of [[David Pelman]] receiving [[fellatio]]. Another, [[Empire (1964 film)|''Empire'']] (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|''Vinyl'']]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[Dystopia|dystopian]] novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as Brigid Berlin, [[Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], Ondine, [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (actor)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16-mm films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot;story&quot; while it was lowered for the other. Then it would be the other film's turn to bask in the glory of sound. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s. The film's influence could be felt as late as 2000 in [[Mike Figgis]]' ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]''. 

Other important films include ''[[My Hustler (1965 film)|My Hustler]]'', ''[[Midnight Cowboy (1969 film)|Midnight Cowboy]]'', and  ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'' (1968), a raunchy pseudo-western. ''[[Blue Movie]]'', a film in which Warhol superstar [[Viva (Warhol Superstar)|Viva]] makes love and fools around in bed with a man for 33 minutes of the film's playing-time, was Warhol's last film as director.  The film was at the time scandalous for its frank approach to a sexual encounter.  For many years Viva refused to allow it to be screened.  It was publicly screened in New York in 2005 for the first time in over thirty years.

After his [[June 3]], [[1968]] shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for the [[The Factory|Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie exploitation fare with ''[[Flesh (film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (film)|Trash]]'', and  ''[[Heat (film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot;Warhol&quot; films, all of which frankly were made to make money, starred [[Joe Dallesandro]], who was more of a Morrissey star than a true Warhol superstar. 

In order to facilitate the success of these Warhol-branded, Morrissey-directed movies in the marketplace, all of Warhol's earlier avant-garde films were removed from distribution and exhibition by [[1972]].  

The first volume of a catalogue raison√© for the Factory film archive is to be published in the spring of 2006.

As an actor, Warhol appeared as a bartender in [[The Cars]]' [[music video]] for their [[single (music)|single]] &quot;Hello Again&quot;, and [[Curiosity Killed The Cat]]'s video for their &quot;Misfit&quot; single (both videos, and others, were produced by Warhol's video production company).   He also appeared in an episode of [[The Love Boat]].

Warhol's character has also been represented in several motion pictures. He has been portrayed by [[Crispin Glover]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Jared Harris]], in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', ''[[Basquiat]]'', and ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]],'' respectively.

=== Books and Print ===
Warhol &quot;wrote&quot; several books.
*''[[A, a novel]]'' (1968, ISBN 0-8021-3553-6) is a literal transcription - containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling - of audio recordings of [[Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.
*''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol; from A to B and back again]]'' (1975, ISBN 0-15-671720-4) - according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (aka Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].
*''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, ISBN 0-15-672960-1), authored by Warhol and [[Pat Hackett]] is a retrospective view of the sixties and the role of Pop Art.
*''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, ISBN 0-446-39138-7, edited by Pat Hackett) is an edited diary that was dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started keeping a diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited.    
        
Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.

===Other Media===
As stated, although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he has authored works in many different media.

* Drawing: Warhol started his carreer drawing commercial illustrations in &quot;blotted-ink&quot; style for warehouses and magazines. Most well known are his pictures of shoes. Some of his drawings were published in little booklets, like &quot;Yum, Yum, Yum&quot; (about food), &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho&quot; (about Christmas) and (of course) &quot;Shoes, Shoes, Shoes&quot;. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably &quot;The Gold Book&quot;, compiled of sensitive, personal drawings of young men. &quot;The Gold Book&quot; is thus dubbed because of the leaf-gold that decorates the pages.

* Sculpture: Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his &quot;Brillo Boxes&quot;; silkscreened wooden replicas of Brillo soap boxes. Other famous works include the &quot;Silver Floating Pillows&quot;; gas-filled, silver, pillow-shaped balloons that were floated out of the window during the presentation.

* Audio: At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot;wife&quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his &quot;Invisible Sculpture,&quot; a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.

* Television:  Andy Warhol dreamed of a television show that he wanted to call &quot;The Nothing Special&quot;, a Special about his favorite subject: Nothing. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, &quot;Andy Warhol's TV&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes&quot; for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest-appearances in shows like &quot;Love Boat&quot;.

* Fashion: Warhol is quoted for having said: &quot;I'd rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?&quot; One of his most well-known Superstars, Edie Sedgwick, aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend Halston was a famous one. Warhol's work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.

* Performance Art: Warhol and his friends staged happenings; theatrical multimedia presentations during parties, containing music, film, slide projections and Gerard Malanga in an S&amp;M outfit cracking a whip.  The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] is the culmination of this area of his work.

* Photography: To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of Polaroid camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. His late oeuvre contains black and white photos sewn together.

=== Product ===
In many of his efforts Warhol has taken the position of a producer or director, rather than a creator. From an artist he gradually became the person that determined the direction and was the public face of a company, having a staff of sorts to do the actual labor involved in his products. He would coin an idea and oversee its execution, his Factory evolved from an atelier into an office.

As this position proved to work out, he found himself able to expand his activities into other fields. He founded the gossip magazine Interview, creating a stage for celebrities he &quot;endorsed&quot; and creating jobs for his friends. He adopted the young painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the band The Velvet Underground and presented them to the public as his latest interest, cooperating with them, shaping their public personas. He would produce things and people, and they were part of his artistic product. He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, made business deals and even &quot;sold&quot; the film-making branch of his company when he decided to spend less time filming himself.

In this respect Warhol talked about &quot;Art Business&quot; and &quot;Business Art&quot;, and how he thought business was the best type of art. This was a radical new stance, as artists had always presented themselves as flamboyant, individual, visionairy outsiders - commenting on the normal part of society, but never really being a part of it. And receiving appreciation for that position on basis of their idealism, rare talents and personalities. Warhol and other pop-artists helped redefine the artist's position as professional, commercial, popular; a logical and valuable part of society. He did this using methods, imagery and talents that were (or at least seemed to be) available to everyone. Perhaps that has been the most meaningful result of (his) Pop Art: a philosophical and practical incorporation of art into society, art as a product of society.

=== Museums ===
The [[Andy Warhol Museum]] is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the largest American art museum dedicated to a single artist, holding more than 4,000 works by the artist himself.

Among others, Andy's brother, John Warhola, and the Warhol Foundation in New York, established in 1991 the Warhol Family Museum of Modern Art in the remote town of [[Medzilaborce]], [[Slovakia]]. Andy's mother, Julia Warhola, was born 15 kilometers away in the village of Mikova. The museum houses several originals donated mainly by the Andy Warhol Foundation in New York and also personal items donated by Warhol's relatives

'''''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted''''' was [[Ice Cube]]'s debut solo album after his acrimonious split from [[N.W.A.]].  It was originally released [[May 16]], [[1990]] (see [[1990 in music]]).

The title of the album is controversial.  It is a spoof of a television show called &quot;[[America's Most Wanted]]&quot;, wherein real-life crimes are reenacted and viewers are asked to call in if they have seen the alleged perpetrators.  The show has taken some criticism for the reenactments, which critics claim perpetuate beliefs in the criminality of [[African-American]] men and other minorities.  The [[alternative political spellings|political spelling]] of &quot;America&quot; with &quot;KKK&quot; equates both the show and the status quo of society in the [[United States]] with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a [[white supremacy|white-supremacist]] organization.

''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'' is a [[gangsta rap]] album, and the songs are tales of a young black man living in the [[ghetto]] and dealing with such issues as [[drug addiction]], [[racism]] and [[poverty]].  To understand the album's statement, it is important to note the environment of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in the early 1990s.  Riots would rack the city following the [[Rodney King]] verdict, seen by many (including Ice Cube) as an example of the racism inherent in the judicial and law enforcement systems.  Also, the [[O. J. Simpson]] trial would provoke further racial tension in the country, especially Los Angeles.  Unlike many other albums from the same period, Cube did not allow the subject matter to infuse the album with inherent negativity.   He attacks perceived racist social structures, far more than many gangsta rappers were doing at the time and since.  Though he describes with detail the conditions of the ghetto, he does so in order to condemn those that allow ghetto despair to occur, instead of glorifying it.

Cube takes some controversial stands, referring to certain types of African-Americans as &quot;Oreo cookies&quot;, implying that they appear to be black but are actually willing participants in the racial hierarchy that keeps the majority of African-Americans living in poverty-stricken and drug-riddled ghettos; specifically, this is aimed at soft-pop-R&amp;B radio stations broadcasting a watered-down sound.  [[Arsenio Hall]] is specifically mentioned as being such a &quot;sell-out&quot;.  The titular song on the album directly parodies the television show, &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot;, exposing the perceived racism inherent in watching largely African-American men being arrested for entertainment.

:&quot;I think back to when I was robbin' my own kind,
:the police didn't pay it no mind.
:But when I start robbin the white folks?
:Now I'm in the pen with the soap on a rope&quot;

A later song (&quot;Get Off My Dick Nigga, and Tell Yo Bitch to Come Here&quot;) returns to the same theme at the end, with newscaster [[Peter Jennings]] reporting on rioting: &quot;Outside the [[South Los Angeles|south central]] area, few cared about the violence because it didn't affect them.&quot;  Also of interest is &quot;It's a Man's World&quot;, a rap-conversation with [[Yo-Yo]]; the two verbally spar and trade sexist barbs back and forth; outside of this song, the album received criticism for alleged [[sexism]], as in &quot;You Can't Fade Me&quot;, a humorous track where Cube fantasizes about kicking a former one-night stand in the stomach because she is pregnant with his baby.  &quot;Nigga You Love To Hate&quot; is also notable for a chorus chanting &quot;Fuck you, Ice Cube&quot;, setting the tone for the album and introducing a pattern of obscenity and profanity.  

Produced by [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy]]) and [[Da Lench Mob]], ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'' received accolades for innovation in production upon release.  However, many critics do not feel that the beats in the album have aged very well.  Since this time, West Coast rap has largely taken a different direction from Ice Cube's style, heading more towards the smooth drawl of [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Snoop Dogg]]; this album sounds dated as a result.  

Before striking out on his own, Ice Cube was a member of the legendary West Coast rap group [[N.W.A.]] (''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' - [[1989]]). Thus, Ice Cube's lyrical style is descended from West Coast rappers like [[Ice T]] (''[[Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say]]'' - [[1989]]) and [[Too Short|Too $hort]] (''[[Life Is Too Short|Life Is...Too $hort]]'').  Musically, [[Public Enemy]] (''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'' - [[1987]])'s spare, hollow beats, [[old school rap]]pers like [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]] (''[[Paid in Full]]'' - [[1987]]) and [[Kurtis Blow]] (''[[Kurtis Blow (album)|Kurtis Blow]]'' - [[1980]]) and 1970s [[funk]] ([[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] - ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]'' - [[1978]]; [[Gap Band]] - ''[[The Gap Band II]]'') and [[soul music|soul]] ([[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]] - ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' - [[1971]]; [[Curtis Mayfield]] - ''[[Let's Do It Again]]'' - [[1975]]) influenced Ice Cube's sound, partially through his producers, [[the Bomb Squad]].

Ice Cube influenced later West Coast rappers, including the stoned drawl of [[Cypress Hill]] (''[[Cypress Hill (album)|Cypress Hill]]'' - [[1991]]) and [[The Pharcyde]] (''[[Bizarre Ride II to the Pharcyde]]'' - [[1992]]), as well as later [[G Funk]] rappers like [[Dr. Dre]] (''[[The Chronic]]'' - [[1992]]) and [[Snoop Doggy Dogg]] (''[[Doggystyle]]'' - [[1993]]).  Though Ice Cube's popularity among mainstream listeners has not continued into the late 1990s, and his sound is distinctively [[old school rap|old school]] to modern ears, many rappers themselves have been influenced by his innovative lyrical techniques.  Rappers like [[Eminem]] (''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' - [[1999]]), [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]] (''[[Illmatic]]'' - [[1994]]) and [[Tupac Shakur]] (''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' - [[1992]]) similarly use cartoonish and unrealistic images of thug violence to protest the conditions of the poor and working class.  While Ice Cube most often described true circumstances in outlandish fashion, such as a fairy tale in &quot;A Gangsta's Fairytale&quot;, later rappers took this to the extreme of describing physically impossible acts of violence in an outrageously exaggerated manner.

The album spawned the hit single soulful and depressing ''Dead Homiez'' on the charts.

'''Afrika Bambaataa''' (born [[April 10]] or [[October 4]], [[1957]] or [[1960]], though his birthdate is hotly debated; he himself refuses to comment on his age) is a DJ and community leader from the South [[Bronx]], who was instrumental in the early development of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] throughout the 1970s.

Afrika Bambaataa's birthname has been mistakenly listed as Kevin Donovan; however, Kevin Donovan was actually another man and leader of the Harlem Underground Band.

During Bambaataa's early years, he was a founding member of the Bronxdale Projects-area [[street gang]], The Savage Seven. Due to the explosive growth of the gang, it later became known as the [[Black Spades]], and Bambaataa rose to the position of Division Leader.  After a life-changing visit to Africa, he changed his name to '''Afrika Bambaataa Aasim'''. Bambaataa was influenced by the depiction of the [[Zulu]] warriors attacking British troops at Rorke's Drift in the [[Michael Caine]] film ''[[Zulu (film)|Zulu]]''.  He took his name, which roughly translated to &quot;affectionate leader&quot;, from the film.

After the visit, Bambaataa decided to use his leadership to turn those involved in the gang life into something more positive to the community. This began the development of [[The Organization]], which soon later became known as the [[Zulu Nation]], a group of racially and politically aware rappers, [[B-boy]]s, [[graffiti]] artists and other people involved in hip hop culture that gained fame in the early eighties to mid nineties.  By [[1977]], inspired by DJ [[Kool Herc]], Bambaataa had begun organizing [[block parties]] all around the South Bronx, and he was soon renowned as one of the best DJs in the business.  In [[1980]], he produced [[Soul Sonic Force]]'s landmark single, &quot;[[Zulu Nation Throwdown]]&quot;. In 2000 [[Rage Against The Machine]] covered Afrika's song Renegades of Funk for their album &quot;[[Renegades (album)|Renegades]]&quot;.

In [[1982]], Bambaataa organised the very first European hip hop tour. Along with himself were rapper and graffiti artist [[Rammellzee]], Zulu Nation DJ [[Grand Mixer DXT]] (formerly Grand Mixer D.St), B-boy and B-girl crews the [[Rock Steady Crew]], and the Double Dutch Girls, as well as legendary graffiti artists [[Fab 5 Freddy]], [[Phase 2]], [[Futura 2000]], and [[Dondi]].

Also in 1982, Bambaataa became a solo artist (having produced several other singles) and released &quot;[[Jazzy Sensation]]&quot; on [[Tommy Boy Records]] in that year.  &quot;[[Planet Rock - The Album|Planet Rock]]&quot;, a popular single, came out that June under the name Afrika Bambaataa and the [[Soul Sonic Force]].  The song melded electronic hip hop beats with the main melody from [[Kraftwerk]]'s [[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]], as well as portions from records by [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Captain Sky]] - thus creating a new style of music altogether, [[electro funk]]. It influenced many styles of [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dance music]], e.g. [[house music]] and [[techno music]]. In [[1984]], Bambaataa recorded &quot;[[Unity]]&quot; with [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] and released &quot;[[World Destruction]]&quot; under the name [[Time Zone]] (with [[John Lydon]]).  [[Shango Funk Theology]], a full length album, came out under the name Shango.  This was followed by &quot;[[Funk You]]&quot; in [[1985]] and then his formal full album debut, [[Beware (The Funk Is Everywhere)]].

Bambaataa then left Tommy Boy and signed with [[Capitol Records]], released [[The Light]] (as Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Family), which included aid from [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Boy George]] and [[UB40]].  [[1990-2000: Decade of Darkness]] was released in [[1991]]. It included both [[hip house]] tracks that were produced by the Italian team De Point (most of those have been collected on ZYX record's &quot;The 12&quot; Mixes&quot; Compilation) as well as hip hop and electro funk tracks. On &quot;Warlocks and Witches&quot;, Bam (as his name is often abbreviated) focused on hip hop. From the mid-1990s, Bam returned to his electro roots, collaborating with [[Westbam]] (who was named after him) and culminating in 2004's excellent album &quot;Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light&quot; which featured [[Gary Numan]] and many others.

'''Muhammed ben Da'ud''' ([[1029]]‚Äì[[December 15]], [[1072]]) was the second sultan of the dynasty of [[Seljuk Turks]], in [[Iran|Persia]], and great-grandson of [[Seljuk]], the founder of the dynasty. He assumed the name of Muhammed when he embraced [[Islam]], and on account of his military prowess and personal valor and fighting skills he obtained the surname '''Alp Arslan''', which signifies &quot;a valiant lion.&quot;  

He succeeded his father [[Da'ud]] as ruler of [[Khorasan]] in [[1059]], and his uncle [[Toghr√ºl|Toƒür√ºl]] as sultan of [[Iran]] and [[Baghdad]] in 1063, and thus became sole monarch of [[Iran|Persia]] from the river [[Oxus]] to the [[Tigris]]. In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by [[Nizam ul-Mulk]], his [[Persians|Persian]] [[vizier]], and one of the most eminent statesmen in early [[Muslim]] history.  With Peace and security established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son [[Malik Shah I]] his heir and successor.  With the hope of acquiring immense booty in the rich church of [[St. Basil]] in [[Caesarea Mazaca]], the capital of [[Cappadocia]], he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the [[Euphrates]] and entered and plundered that city. He then marched into [[Armenia]] and [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgia]], which he conquered in [[1064]].

==Byzantine struggle==
In [[1068]] Alp Arslan invaded the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] [[Romanus IV]] Diogenes, assuming the command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the first two of which were conducted by the emperor himself while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenus (great-uncle  of Emperor [[Manuel Comnenus]]), the Turks were defeated in detail in [[1070]] driven across the Euphrates. In [[1071]] Romanus again took the field and advanced with 100,000 men, including a contingent of the Turkish tribe of the [[Uzes]] as well as contingents of [[France|French]] and [[Normans]], under [[Ursel of Bahol]], into [[Armenia]]. 

At [[Manzikert]], on the [[Murad Tchai]], north of [[Lake Van]], he was met by Alp Arslan. The sultan proposed terms of peace, which were rejected by the emperor, and the two forces met in the [[Battle of Manzikert]], in which the Byzantines, after a terrible slaughter, were totally routed; a result due mainly to the betrayal of Romanus by his political enemies during the battle and the rapid tactics of the Turkish cavalry. 

Emperor Romanus IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, who treated him with generosity, and terms of peace having been agreed to, dismissed him, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. This famous conversation is recorded to have taken place after Romanus IV was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan:

:''Alp Arslan'': &quot;What would you do if I was brought before you as a prisoner?&quot;
:''Romanus'': &quot;Perhaps I'd kill you, or exhibit you in the streets of Constantinople.&quot;
:''Alp Arslan'': &quot;My punishment is far heavier.  I forgive you, and set you free.&quot;

Unfortunately for Romanus, the Emperor's subjects were far less kind than his enemy, making the mercy of Alp Arlsan a curse: Romanus was blinded and finally killed after great torment.

After Alp Arslan's victories the balance in the near Asia changed completely in favour of [[Seljuk Turks]] and [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly another four centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, their victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in the [[Middle East]]. Most historians, including Edward Gibbons, date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in Anatolia which had furnished the Empire with men and treasure. The importance of this battle, and the skill of Alp Arslan in fighting it, cannot be overstated. 

==State organization==
Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm, domestic affairs being handled by his Persian vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]; founder of the administrative organization which characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military fiefs, governed by Seljuk princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Persian agricultural scene.  This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedantary Persians, and other established cultures within the Seljuk realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army, without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiery.  He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.  

==Death==
The dominion of Alp Arslan after Manzikert extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march to the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, [[Yussuf el-Harezmi]], a [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmian]].  He was, however, obliged to surrender and was carried a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to a cruel death.  Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan.  Alp Arslan motioned to his guards not to interfere and drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died four days later from this wound on [[November 25]], [[1072]] in his 42nd year, and was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father [[√áaƒürƒ± Bey]]. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription: 

:‚Äú''O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold! He is under the black soil now''...‚Äù

As he lay dying, Alp Arslan whispered to his son that his vanity had killed him.  &quot;Alas,&quot; he is recorded to have said, &quot;surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause, guarded night and day by them, I should have allowed them to do their job.  I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense.  I forgot those warnings, and here I lay, dying in agony.  Remember well the lessons learned, and do not allow your vanity to overreach your good sense...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American Film Institute''' ('''AFI''') is an independent [[non-profit]] organization created by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which was established in [[1967]] when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act.  

George Stevens, Jr., was the first CEO and Director.  In 1980 [[Jean Picker Firstenberg]] became Director and CEO, a position she still holds.

The American Film Institute focuses on training through hands-on experience with established figures in the [[AFI Conservatory]], as well as on preserving old film, which is subject to degradation of its [[film stock]]. In spite of its name, AFI does not focus exclusively on [[film]], but also on [[television]] and [[video]].

In [[1973]], the AFI established a [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Life Achievement Award]]. 

In [[1998]], the 100th anniversary of American film, AFI began its [[100 Years Series]], celebrating and promoting interest in film history. 

They recently opened the [[AFI Silver]] theatre in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] near [[Washington, D.C.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''auteur theory''' is the theory that a film (or a body of work) by a director (or, rarely, a producer) reflects the personal vision and preoccupations of that director, as if he or she were the work's primary &quot;author&quot; ([[auteur]]).  The auteur theory has had a major impact on [[film criticism]] worldwide ever since it was first advocated by [[Fran√ßois Truffaut]] in 1954. &quot;Auteurism&quot; is the method of analyzing films based on this theory (or, alternately, the characteristics of a director's work that makes him an auteur). Both the Auteur Theory and the auteurism method of film analysis are frequently associated with the [[French New Wave]] and the film critics who wrote for the [[Cahiers du cin√©ma]].

''For a list of directors who are considered '''auteurs''', go to the article [[Auteur]]''.
__NOTOC__
==Truffaut's theory==

In his [[1954]] essay ''Une certaine tendance du cin√©ma fran√ßais'' (&quot;a certain tendency in the French cinema&quot;) [[Fran√ßois Truffaut]] coined the phrase &quot;la politique des auteurs&quot;, and asserted that the worst of [[Jean Renoir]]'s movies would always be more interesting than the best of [[Jean Delannoy]]'s. &quot;Politique&quot; might very well be translated as &quot;policy,&quot; &quot;polemic&quot; or &quot;program&quot;; it involves a conscious decision to look at movies and to value them in a certain way. Truffaut provocatively said, &quot;There are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors.&quot; 

Much of Truffaut's writing of this period (as too that of his colleagues at the film criticism magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin√©ma]]'') was designed to lambast post-war French cinema, and especially the big production films of the ''cin√©ma de qualit√©'' (&quot;quality films&quot;) that Truffaut's circle referred to with disdain as ''cin√©ma de papa'' (or &quot;Dad's cinema&quot;).  Their sudden discovery of a host of great American movies which flooded France at the end of the war (the [[Vichy France|Nazi occupation]] had prevented the French from seeing such classics as [[The Maltese Falcon]] and [[Citizen Kane]]) incited Truffaut to take up arms against what he considered to be an old-fashioned and sterile cinema.  (One of the unfortunate ironies of the auteur theory is that, at the very moment Truffaut was writing, the Hollywood [[studio system]] of the 1950's had destroyed much of what he had appreciated.) 

Truffaut's thinking was indebted to the work of [[Andr√© Bazin]], co-founder of the ''Cahiers du cin√©ma'' (where Truffaut worked), who promoted the idea that films should reflect a director's personal vision and who championed such filmmakers as [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Jean Renoir]].  Although Bazin provided a forum for auteurism to flourish, he himself remained wary of its excesses.

Another key element of Truffaut's theory comes from [[Alexandre Astruc]]'s notion of the ''cam√©ra-stylo'' or &quot;camera-pen&quot; and the idea that directors should wield their cameras like writers use their pens and that they need not be hindered by traditional storytelling.

Truffaut and the members of the ''Cahiers'' recognized that moviemaking was an industrial process. However, they proposed an ideal to strive for: the director should use the commercial apparatus the way a writer uses a pen and, through the [[mise en sc√®ne]], imprint his or her vision on the work (conversely, the role of the screenwriter was minimized in their eyes). While recognizing that not all directors reached this ideal, they valued the work of those who neared it.

Truffaut's theory maintains that all good directors (and many bad ones) have such a distinctive style or consistent theme that their influence is unmistakable in the body of their work.  Truffaut himself was appreciative of both directors with a marked visual style (such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]), and those whose visual style was less pronounced but who had nevertheless a consistent theme throughout their movies (such as [[Jean Renoir]]'s humanism).

==Impact of the &quot;auteur theory&quot;==

The ''auteur theory'' was used by the directors of the ''[[nouvelle vague]]'' (New Wave) movement of French cinema in the 1960s (many of whom were also critics at the ''Cahiers du cin√©ma'') as justification for their intensely personal and idiosyncratic films.

The approach soon found a home in English-language film criticism. In the U.K., ''Movie'' adopted auteurism and in the U.S., [[Andrew Sarris]] introduced it in the essay, &quot;Notes on the Auteur Theory&quot; in 1962.  This essay is where the half-French, half-English term, &quot;auteur theory,&quot; originated.  To be classified as an &quot;auteur&quot;, according to Sarris, a director must accomplish technical competence in his or her technique, personal style in terms of how the movie looks and feels, and interior meaning (although many of Sarris's auterist criteria were left vague). Later in the decade, Sarris published ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions, 1929-1968'', which quickly became the unofficial bible of auteurism.

The auteurist critics&amp;mdash;[[Fran√ßois Truffaut|Truffaut]], [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol|Chabrol]], [[√âric Rohmer|Rohmer]]&amp;mdash;wrote mostly about directors (as they were directors themselves), although they also produced some shrewd appreciations of actors. Later writers of the same general school have emphasized the contributions of star personalities like [[Mae West]]. However, the stress was on directors, and screenwriters, producers and others have reacted with a good deal of hostility. Writer [[William Goldman]] has said that, on first hearing the auteur theory, his reaction was, &quot;What's the punchline?&quot;

==Criticism of the &quot;auteur theory&quot;==

Starting in the 1960s, there has been a backlash against the auteur theory.  [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Andrew Sarris|Sarris]] feuded in the pages of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and various film magazines.  One reason for the backlash is the collaborative aspect of shooting a film (one person cannot do everything) and in the theory's privileging of the role of the director (whose name, at times, has become more important than the movie itself).  In [[Pauline Kael|Kael]]'s review of [[Citizen Kane]], a classic film for the auteur model, she points out how the film involved the talents of co-writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]] and would have been hurt without their distinctive ability.  Also, the very people who championed the auteur theory backed away from it. [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] handed over much creative control to others (most notably [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]]) in his later films while, in a twist of irony, Truffaut's later films embraced the same formalism he rejected early on in his career.  Also, with costly films like [[Michael Cimino]]'s [[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]], the excesses of auteurism not only created uncreative films, they put studios out of business.

However, even with the reevaulation of auteurism, the auteur theory continues to influence new filmmakers to this day.

'''Akira Kurosawa''' (ÈªíÊæ§ Êòé ''Kurosawa Akira'', also ÈªíÊ≤¢ Êòé in [[Wiktionary:Shinjitai|Shinjitai]], [[23 March]], [[1910]] &amp;ndash; [[6 September]], [[1998]]) was a prominent [[Japan|Japanese]] [[film director]], [[film producer]], and [[screenwriter]].

Few filmmakers have had a career so long or so acclaimed as Akira Kurosawa, perhaps Japan's best-known filmmaker. His films greatly influenced an entire generation of filmmakers the world over, ranging from George Lucas to Sergio Leone. 

His first credited film (''[[Sanshiro Sugata (1943 film)|Sugata Sanshiro]]'') was released in 1943; his last (''[[Madadayo]]'') in 1993. His many awards include the [[Legion d'Honneur]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lifetime Achievement. 

== Early Career ==
Kurosawa was born in [[Ota, Tokyo|Omori]], [[Tokyo]], the youngest of seven children. He trained as a painter and began work in the film industry as an assistant director to Kajiro Yamamoto in 1936. He made his directorial debut in 1943 with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata (1943 film)|Sugata Sanshiro]]''. His first few films were made under the watchful eye of the wartime Japanese government and sometimes contained nationalistic themes. For instance, ''[[The Most Beautiful|The Most Beautiful]]'' is a propaganda film about Japanese women working in an armaments factory. ''[[Sanshiro Sugata Part II|Judo Saga 2]]'' has been held to be explicitly anti-American in the way that it portrays Japanese [[judo]] as superior to western (American) [[boxing]]. 

His first post-war film ''No regrets for our youth'', by contrast, is critical of the old Japanese regime and is about the wife of a left-wing dissident arrested for his political leanings. Kurosawa made several more films which deal with contemporary Japan, most notably ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' and ''[[Stray Dog]]''. However it was a period film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' which made him internationally famous and won the Grand Prix at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

== Characteristics ==
Kurosawa is best-known for his period pieces or {{nihongo|''[[jidaigeki]]''|ÊôÇ‰ª£Âäá|}} like ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Ran (1985 film)|Ran]]'', but several of his films dealt with contemporary Japan: for example ''[[Stray Dog]]'', which looks at the criminal underworld just after the end of the war, and ''[[Ikiru]]'', which deals with a Japanese bureaucrat who discovers that he is suffering from cancer but eventually steps out of depression and struggles against bureacratic inertia to leave his small contribution to the world in the form of a small community park before he dies.

Kurosawa had a distinctive cinematic technique, which he had developed by the 1950s, and which gave his films a unique look. He liked using telephoto lenses for the way they flattened the frame and also because he believed that placing cameras farther away from his actors produced better performances. He also liked using multiple cameras, which allowed him to shoot an action from different angles. Another Kurosawa trademark was the use of weather elements to heighten mood: for example the heavy rain in the final battle in ''Seven Samurai'' and the fog in ''Throne of Blood''. Kurosawa also liked using left-to-right frame wipes as a transition device.

He was known as &quot;Tenno&quot;, literally &quot;Emperor&quot;, for his dictatorial directing style. He was a perfectionist who spent enormous amounts of time and effort to achieve the desired visual effects. In ''[[Rashomon]]'', he dyed the rain water black with calligraphy ink in order to achieve the effect of heavy rain, and ended up using up the entire local water supply of the location area in creating the rainstorm. In ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', in the final scene in which Mifune is shot by arrows, Kurosawa used real arrows shot by expert archers from a short range, landing within centimetres of Mifune's body. 

Other stories include demanding a stream be made to run in the opposite direction in order to get a better visual effect, and having the roof of a house removed, later to be replaced, because he felt the roof's presence to be unattractive in a short sequence filmed from a train.

== Influences ==
A notable feature of Kurosawa's films is the breadth of his artistic influences. Some of his plots are adaptations of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'' is based on ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Ran (1985 film)|Ran]]'' is based on ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''Throne of Blood'' is based on ''[[Macbeth]]''. Kurosawa also directed film adaptations of Russian novels, including ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' by [[Dostoevsky]] and ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]]. ''Ikiru'' was based on [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''. ''[[High and Low]]'' was based on ''[[King's Ransom]]'' by [[United States|American]] [[crime]] writer [[Ed McBain]]. ''[[Stray Dog]]'' was inspired by the detective novels of [[Georges Simenon]]. The American film director [[John Ford]] also had a large influence on his work. 

Despite criticism by some Japanese critics that Kurosawa was &quot;too Western&quot;, he was deeply influenced by Japanese culture as well, including the [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]] theaters and the jidaigeki (period drama) genre of Japanese cinema.

== His influence ==
Kurosawa's films had a huge influence on world cinema. Most explicitly, ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' was remade as the [[western movie|western]] ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', [[science fiction]] movie ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', and Pixar's ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. It also inspired two [[Hindi films]], [[Ramesh Sippy]]'s ''[[Sholay]]'' and Rajkumar Santhoshi's ''[[China Gate]]'', with similar plots. The story has also inspired [[novel]]s, among them [[Stephen King]]'s fifth ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' novel, ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''. 

''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''  was the basis for the [[Sergio Leone]] western ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[Miller's Crossing (film)|Miller's Crossing]]'', and the [[Bruce Willis]] prohibition-era ''[[Last Man Standing (film)|Last Man Standing]]''. 

''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' had an influence on [[George Lucas]]'s earliest ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, especially in the characters of R2-D2 and C3PO.

''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' not only helped open Japanese cinema to the world but virtually entered the English language as a term for fractured, inconsistent narratives as well as influencing other works, including episodes of television series and many motion pictures.

== Collaboration ==
During his most productive period, from the late 40s to the mid-60s, Kurosawa often worked with the same group of collaborators. [[Fumio Hayasaka]] composed music for seven of his films; notably ''Rashomon'', ''Ikiru'' and ''Seven Samurai''. Many of Kurosawa's scripts, including ''Throne of Blood'', ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ran'' were co-written with [[Hideo Oguni]]. [[Yoshiro Muraki]] was Kurosawa's [[production designer]] or [[art director]] for most of his films after ''Stray Dog'' in 1949 and [[Asakazu Naki]] was his [[cinematographer]] on 11 films including ''Ikiru'', ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ran''. Kurosawa also liked recycling the same group of actors, especially [[Takashi Shimura]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]]. His collaboration with the latter is one of the greatest director-actor combinations in cinema history. It began with 1948's ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' and ended with 1964's ''[[Red Beard]]''.

== Later films ==
Red Beard marked a turning point in Kurosawa's career in more ways than one. In addition to being his last film with Mifune, it was his last in black-and-white. It was also his last as a major director within the Japanese studio system making roughly a film a year.  Kurosawa was signed to direct a Hollywood project, ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''; but [[20th Century Fox]] replaced him with [[Kinji Fukasaku]] before it was completed.  His next few films were a lot harder to finance and were made at intervals of five years. The first, ''[[Dodesukaden]]'', about a group of poor people living around a rubbish dump, was not a success. 

After an attempted suicide, Kurosawa went on to make several more films although arranging domestic financing was highly difficult despite his international reputation. ''[[Dersu Uzala]]'', made in the [[Soviet Union]] and set in Siberia in the early 20th century, was the only Kurosawa film made outside Japan and not in Japanese. It is about the friendship of a Russian explorer and a nomadic hunter. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar]] for Best Foreign Language Film. ''[[Kagemusha]]'', financed with the help of the director's most famous admirers, [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]], is the story of a man who is the double of a medieval Japanese lord and takes over his identity. Most important was ''[[Ran (1985 film)|Ran]]'', Kurosawa's version of King Lear set in medieval Japan. It was the great project of Kurosawa's late career, and he spent a decade planning it and trying to obtain funding, which he was finally able to do with the help of the French producer Serge Silberman. The film was a phenomenal international success and is generally considered Kurosawa's last masterpiece.

Kurosawa made three more films during the 1990s which were more personal than his earlier works. ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' is a series of vignettes based on his own dreams. ''[[Rhapsody in August]]'' is about memories of the [[Nagasaki]] atom bomb and his final film: ''[[Madadayo]]'' is about a retired teacher and his former students. Kurosawa died in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], at age 88.

==Trivia==

Kurosawa was a notoriously lavish gourmet, and spent huge quantities of money on film sets providing an uneatably large quantity and quality  of delicacies, especially meat, for the cast and crew.

'''Ancient Egypt''' was a [[civilization]] located along the Lower [[Nile]], reaching from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north to as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the time of its greatest extension (15th century BC). It lasted for three [[millennia]], from ''circa'' [[3200 BC]] to [[343 BC]], ending when [[Artaxerxes III]] conquered [[Egypt]].  As a civilization based on [[irrigation]] it is the quintessential example of a [[hydraulic empire]].[[Image:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg |thumb|right|450px|[[Khafre's Pyramid]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]) and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] (c.[[2600 BC]] or perhaps earlier)]]

==Background==
[[Image:Map Ancient Egypt.png|thumb|right|275px|Map of Ancient Egypt]]Egypt is a [[transcontinental nation]] located mostly in [[North Africa]], with the [[Sinai Peninsula]] lying in [[Asia]]. The country has shorelines on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Red Sea]], the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. It borders [[Libya]] to the west; [[Sudan]] to the south; and the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Israel]] to the east. Ancient Egypt was divided into two kingdoms, known as [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The [[Nile]] river flows northward from a southerly point to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The Nile river, around which much of the population of the country clusters, has been the lifeline for Egyptian culture since the [[Stone Age]] and [[Naqada]] cultures.

The area around the Nile was called Kemet (&quot;the black land&quot;, in [[Ancient Egyptian]] ''Kmt''), the name for the dark soil deposited by the Nile floodwaters. In contrast, the desert was called Deshret (&quot;the red land&quot;, in [[Ancient Egyptian]] ''Dsrt''), c.f. [[Herodotus]]: &quot;Egypt is a land of black soil.... We know that [[Libya]] is a redder earth&quot; (Histories, 2:12). The vowels within the consonants K-M-T are not known with certainty. [[Coptic language|Coptic]], however, provides some indication.

Nomadic hunter-gatherers began living along the Nile during the [[Pleistocene]]. Traces of these early peoples appear in the form of artifacts and rock carvings along the terraces of the Nile and in the oases. By about 6000 B.C., organized agriculture and large building construction had appeared in the Nile Valley.

==People==
Many theories have been proposed regarding the origins of early Egyptians, a subject still imbued with controversy today.  [[Controversy over race of Ancient Egyptians]] has more information about this subject.

Egyptian society was a merging of [[Berbers|North]] and [[Northeast Africa]]n as well as [[Southwest Asia]]n peoples. Modern [[genetic genealogy|genetics]] reveals {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.348}} {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.349}} that the Egyptian population today is characterized by [[Haplogroup#Y chromosome DNA haplogroups|paternal]] lineages common to [[Berbers|North Africans]] primarily, and to some [[Near East]]ern peoples. Studies based on the [[Haplogroup#Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups|maternal]] lineages closely links modern Egyptians with people from modern [[Ethiopia]] {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.350}}, {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.351}}. The ancient Egyptians themselves traced their origin to a land they called [[Land of Punt|Punt]], or &quot;Ta Nteru&quot; (&quot;Land of the Gods&quot;), which most Egyptologists locate in the area encompassing the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].

A recent bioanthropological study on the dental morphology of ancient Egyptians confirms dental traits most characteristic of [[Berbers|North African]] and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n populations. The study also establishes biological continuity from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] to the post-pharaonic periods. Among the samples included is skeletal material from the [[Gallery of Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which was found to most closely resemble the [[Badarian]] series of the predynastic {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.352}}, {{ref|www.world-science.net.353}}. A study based on stature and body proportions suggests that [[Nilotic]] or tropical body characteristics were also present in some later groups {{ref|Zakrzewski}} as the Egyptian empire expanded southward.

[[Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion|Champollion the Younger]], who deciphered the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed in ''Expressions et Termes Particuliers'' that ''kmt'' referred to a 'negroid' population. Modern day professional Egyptologists, anthropologists, and linguists, however, overwhelmingly agree that the term referred to the dark soil of the Nile Valley rather than the people, which contrasted with ''dSrt'' or the &quot;red land&quot; of the [[Sahara]] desert.

In c. 450 BC, [[Herodotus]] wrote, &quot;the Colchians are Egyptians... on the fact that they are swarthy (''melanchr√¥s'') and wooly-haired (''oulothrix'')&quot; (Histories Book 2:104). ''Melanchros'' was also used by [[Homer]] to describe the sunburnt complexion of [[Odysseus]] (Od. 16.176). 

Although analyzing the hair of ancient Egyptian [[Mummy|mummies]] from the Late [[Middle Kingdom]] has revealed evidence of a stable diet {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.354}}, mummies from circa [[3200 BC]] show signs of severe [[anemia]] and [[Hematology|hemolitic disorders]] {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.355}}.

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of ancient Egypt]]''
Egyptian culture was remarkably stable and changed little over a period of nearly 3000 years. This includes religion, customs, art expression, architecture and social structure.

The [[history of ancient Egypt]] proper starts with Egypt as a unified state, which occurred sometime around [[3000 BC]]. [[Narmer]], who unified Upper and Lower Egypt, was the first [[pharaoh]]; though [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian [[society]] existed for a much longer period (see [[Predynastic Egypt]]).

Along the [[Nile]], in [[10th millennium BC]], a [[cereal|grain]]-[[grinding]] [[culture]] using the earliest type of [[sickle]] [[blade]]s had been replaced by another culture of [[hunting|hunters]], [[fishing|fishers]], and [[hunter-gatherer|gathering]] peoples using [[stone tool]]s. Evidence also indicates human habitation in the southwestern corner of Egypt, near the [[Sudan]] border, before [[8000 BC]]. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around [[8th millennium BC|8000 BC]] began to desiccate the pastoral lands of [[Egypt]], eventually forming the [[Sahara]] (c.[[2500 BC]]), and early tribes naturally migrated to the Nile river where they developed a settled [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralized [[society]] (see [[Nile#History|Nile: History]]). There is evidence of [[pastoralism]] and cultivation of [[cereal]]s in the East [[Sahara]] in the [[7th millennium BC]]. By [[6000 BC]] ancient Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were [[herding]] cattle and [[construction|constructing]] large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)]] was in use by [[4000 BC]]. The [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]] continues through this time, variously held to begin with the [[Naqada]] culture. Some authorities however begin the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]] earlier, in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (see [[Predynastic Egypt]]).

Egypt unified as a single state circa [[3000 BC]]. [[Egyptian chronology]] involves assigning beginnings and endings to various dynasties beginning around this time. The [[conventional Egyptian chronology]] is the accepted developments during the 20th century, but do not include any of the major revision proposals that have also been made in that time. Even within a single work, often archeologists will offer several possible dates or even several whole chronologies as possibilities. Consequently, there may be discrepancies between dates shown here and in articles on particular rulers. Often there are also several possible spellings of the names. Typically, Egyptologists divide the history of pharaonic civilization using a schedule laid out first by [[Manetho]]'s ''Aegyptaica''.

=== Taxation ===
The Egyptian government imposed a number of different taxes upon its people. As there was no known form of currency during that time period, taxes were paid for &quot;in kind&quot; (with produce or work). The Vizier controlled the taxation system through the departments of state. The departments had to report daily on the amount of stock availible, and how much was expected in the future. Taxes were paid for depending on a persons craft or duty. Landowners paid their taxes in grain and other produce grown on their property. Craftsmen paid their taxes in the goods that they produced. Hunters and fishermen paid their taxes with produce from the river, marshes, and desert. One person from every household was required to pay a labor tax by doing public work for a few weeks every year, such as digging canals or mining. However, a richer noble could hire a poorer man to do his labor tax.

==Language==
{{main|Egyptian language}}
Ancient Egyptian constitutes an independent branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] language [[phylum (linguistics)|phylum]]. Its closest relatives are the [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and [[Beja language|Beja]] groups of languages. Written records of the [[Egyptian language]] have been dated from about [[32nd century BC|3200 BC]], making it one of the oldest and longest documented languages. Scholars group Egyptian into six major chronological divisions:
*'''[[Archaic Egyptian]]''' (before 3000 BC)
:Consists of inscriptions from the late [[Predynastic Period|Predynastic]] and [[Early Dynastic Period|Early Dynastic]] period. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian [[hieroglyphic]] writing appears on [[Naqada]] II pottery vessels.
*'''[[Old Egyptian]]''' (3000&amp;ndash;2000 BC)
:The language of the [[Old Kingdom]] and [[First Intermediate Period]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] are the largest body of literature written in this phase of the language. Tomb walls of elite Egyptians from this period also bear autobiographical writings representing Old Egyptian. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the tripling of [[ideogram]]s, phonograms, and determinatives to indicate the plural. Overall, it does not differ significantly from the next stage.
*'''[[Middle Egyptian]]''' (2000&amp;ndash;1300 BC)
:Often dubbed '''Classical Egyptian''', this stage is known from a variety of textual evidence in [[hieroglyphic]] and [[hieratic]] scripts dated from about the [[Middle Kingdom]]. It includes funerary texts inscribed on [[sarcophagi]] such as the [[Coffin Texts]]; wisdom texts instructing people on how to lead a life that exemplified the ancient Egyptian philosophical worldview (see the [[Ipuwer papyrus]]); tales detailing the adventures of a certain individual, for example the [[The Story of Sinuhe|Story of Sinhue]]; medical and scientific texts such as the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] and the [[Ebers papyrus]]; and poetic texts praising a god or a [[pharaoh]], like the [[Hymn to the Nile]]. The Egyptian [[vernacular]] already began to change from the written language as evidenced by some Middle Kingdom hieratic texts, but classical Middle Egyptian continued to be written in formal contexts well into the Late Dynastic period (sometimes referred to as [[Late Middle Egyptian]]).
*'''[[Late Egyptian]]''' (1300&amp;ndash;700 BC)
:Records of this stage appear in the second part of the [[New Kingdom]], considered by many as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of ancient Egyptian civilization. It contains a rich body of religious and secular literature, comprising such famous examples as the [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instructions of Ani]]. It was also the language of [[Ramesside]] administration. Late Egyptian is not totally distinct from Middle Egyptian, as many &quot;classicisms&quot; appear in historical and literary documents of this phase. However, the difference between Middle and Late Egyptian is greater than that between Middle and Old Egyptian. It's also a better representative than Middle Egyptian of the spoken language in the New Kingdom and beyond. Hieroglyphic [[orthography]] saw an enormous expansion of its [[grapheme|graphemic]] inventory between the Late Dynastic and [[Ptolemaic]] periods.
*'''[[Demotic Egyptian]]''' (7th century BC&amp;ndash;4th century AD)
{{main|Demotic Egyptian}}
*'''[[Coptic language|Coptic]]''' (3rd&amp;ndash;17th century AD)
{{main|Coptic language}}

===Writing===
For many years, the earliest known hieroglyphic inscription was the [[Narmer Palette]], found during excavations at [[Hierakonpolis]] (modern Kawm al-Ahmar) in the [[1890s]], which has been dated to c.[[3200 BC]]. However recent [[Archaeology|archaeological]] findings reveal that symbols on [[Gerzean]] pottery, ''c.''[[4000 BC]], resemble the traditional hieroglyph forms {{ref|www.touregypt.net.356}}. Also in 1998 a German archeological team under [[Gunter Dreyer]] excavating at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (modern [[Umm el-Qa'ab]]) uncovered tomb [[U-j]], which belonged to a [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] ruler, and they recovered three hundred clay labels inscribed with [[proto-hieroglyphics]] dating to the [[Naqada IIIA]] period, circa [[33rd century BC]] {{ref|www.exn.ca.357}}, {{ref|www.findarticles.com.358}}. 

Egyptologists refer to Egyptian writing as '''[[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyph]]s''', today standing as the world's earliest known [[writing system]].  The hieroglyphic script was partly [[syllabic]], partly [[ideographic]]. '''[[Hieratic]]''' is a cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs and was first used during the First Dynasty (c. 2925 BC &amp;ndash; c. 2775 BC). The term '''[[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]]''', in the context of Egypt, came to refer to both the script and the language that followed the Late Ancient Egyptian stage, i.e. from the [[Nubian]] [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] until its marginalization by the Greek [[Koine]] in the early centuries AD. After the conquest of [[Amr ibn al-A'as]] in the 7th century AD, the [[Coptic language]] survived as a spoken language into the [[Middle Ages]]. Today, it continues to be the liturgical language of the [[Christian]] minority.

Beginning from around [[2700 BC]], Egyptians used [[pictogram]]s to represent [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|vocal sounds]] -- both [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] vocalizations (see [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|Hieroglyph: Script]]). By [[2000 BC]], 26 [[pictogram]]s were being used to represent 24 (known) main [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|vocal sounds]]. The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] (c. [[1800 BC]]) is only an [[abjad]] system and was derived from these [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|uniliteral signs]] as well as other [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s.

The hieroglyphic script finally fell out of use around the [[4th century]] AD. Attempts to decipher it began after the [[15th century]] (see ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'').

==Culture==
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
The Egyptian religions, embodied in [[Egyptian mythology]], were a succession of beliefs held by the people of Egypt, as early as [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] times and all the way until the coming of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] in the [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Graeco-Roman]] era.  These were conducted by Egyptian [[priest]]s or [[magician]]s, but the use of [[magic and religion|magic]] and [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]s is questioned.

Every animal portrayed and worshipped in ancient Egyptian art, writing and religion is indigenous to [[Africa]], all the way from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] until the [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Graeco-Roman]] eras, over 3000 years.  The [[Dromedary]], [[Domestication|domesticated]] first in [[Arabia]], first appears in Egypt (and North Africa) beginning in the 2nd millennium BCE.

The religious nature of ancient Egyptian civilization influenced its contribution to the [[arts of the ancient world]]. Many of the great works of ancient Egypt depict gods, goddesses, and pharaohs, who were also considered divine. [[Ancient Egyptian art]] in general is characterized by the idea of order. 

Evidence of [[Mummy#Mummies in other civilizations|mummies]] and [[Pyramid#Structures|pyramids outside ancient Egypt]] indicate reflections of ancient Egyptian belief values on other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures, transmitted in one way over the [[Silk Road]]. Ancient Egypt's [[Foreign contacts of Ancient Egypt|foreign contacts]] included [[Nubia]] and [[Punt]] to the south, the [[Aegean]] and [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greece]] to the north, the [[Levant]] and other regions in the [[Near East]] to the east, and also [[Libya]] to the west.

Some scholars have speculated that Egypt's art pieces are sexually [[Symbolism|symbolic]].

==Ancient achievements==
[[image:Egypte louvre 316.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Louvre Museum]] antiquity]]
See [[Predynastic Egypt]] for inventions and other significant achievements in the [[Civilization#Sahara Region|Sahara region]] before the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|Protodynastic Period]]. 

The art and science of [[engineering]] was present in Egypt, such as accurately determining the position of points and the distances between them (known as [[surveying]]). These skills were used to outline [[pyramid]] bases. The [[Egyptian pyramids]] took the geometric shape formed from a polygonal base and a point, called the apex, by triangular faces. [[Cement|Hydraulic Cement]]  was first invented by the Egyptians. The [[Al Fayyum]] [[Irrigation]] (water works) was one of the main agricultural breadbaskets of the ancient world. There is evidence of ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|twelfth dynasty]] using the natural lake of the Fayyum as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons. From the time of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|First dynasty]] or before, the Egyptians [[Mining|mined]] [[turquoise]] in [[Sinai Peninsula]].

The earliest evidence (circa [[1600 BC]]) of traditional [[empiricism]] is credited to Egypt, as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers papyrus|Ebers papyri]]. The roots of the [[Scientific method#History|Scientific method]] may be traced back to the ancient Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians are also credited with devising the world's earliest known [[alphabet]], [[decimal system]] {{ref|www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk.360}} and complex [[Timeline of mathematics|mathematical formularizations]], in the form of the [[Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri]]. An awareness of the [[golden ratio]] seems to be reflected in many constructions, such as the [[Egyptian pyramids]]. 

The art of glass making is of very ancient origin with the Egyptians, as is evident from the glass jars, figures and ornaments discovered in the tombs. The paintings on the tombs have been interpreted as descriptive of the process of glass blowing. These illustrations representing smiths blowing
their fires by means of reeds tipped with clay. Therefore it can be concluded that glass-blowing is apparently of Egyptian origin.

===Open problems===
{{main|Unsolved problems in Egyptology}}

There is a question as to the sophistication of ancient Egyptian technology, and there are several [[open problem]]s concerning real and alleged ancient Egyptian achievements. Certain artifacts and records do not fit with conventional technological development systems. It is not known why there is no neat progression to an Egyptian [[Iron Age]] nor why the historical record shows the Egyptians taking so long to begin using [[iron]]. It is unknown how the Egyptians shaped and worked [[granite]]. The exact date the Egyptians started producing [[glass]] is debated.

Some question whether the Egyptians were capable of long distance [[navigation]] in their [[boat]]s and when they became knowledgeable sailors. It is contentiously disputed as to whether or not the Egyptians had some understanding of [[electricity]] and if the Egyptians used [[engine]]s or [[Baghdad Battery|batteries]]. The [[Dendera light|relief at Dendera]] is interpreted in various ways by scholars. The topic of the [[Saqqara Bird]] is controversial, as is the extent of the Egyptians' understanding of [[aerodynamics]]. It is unknown for certain if the Egyptians had [[kite]]s or [[glider]]s.

[[Beekeeping]] is known to have been particularly well developed in Egypt, as accounts are given by several [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers &amp;mdash; [[Virgil]], [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and [[Columella]]. It is unknown whether Egyptian [[beekeeping]] developed independently or as an [[import]] from [[Southern Asia]].

The '''''motor neurone diseases''''' (MND) are a group of progressive neurological disorders that destroy [[motor neuron]]s, the cells that control voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing.  [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), sometimes called [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease, [[progressive muscular atrophy]] (PMA), [[spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA), progressive or pseudo-bulbar palsy (PBP) and [[primary lateral sclerosis]] (PLS) are all forms of motor neurone disease.

==Terminology==
In this article, MND refers to a group of diseases which affect the motor neurons. In the [[United States]], the term [[ALS]] is more commonly used, where it is also known as [[Lou Gehrig|Lou Gehrig's]] disease, after the [[baseball]] player. Although previously described by other neurologists of the 19th century, it was [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], a [[France|French]] [[neurologist]], who suggested grouping together a number of disparate conditions all affecting the lateral horn of the spinal cord in [[1869]]. In France the disease is sometimes known as Maladie de Charcot (Charcot's disease), although it may also be referred to by the direct translation of ALS, Sclerose Laterale Amyotrophique (SLA). To help prevent confusion, the annual scientific research conference dedicated to the study of MND is called the International ALS/MND Symposium.

==Signs and symptoms==
Neurological examination presents specific signs associated with upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Signs of [[upper motor neuron]] damage include [[spasticity]], brisk [[reflex action|reflexes]] and the [[Babinski sign]]. Signs of [[lower motor neuron]] damage include weakness and muscle atrophy. 

Note that every muscle group in the body requires both upper and lower motor neurons to function. It is a common misconception that &quot;upper&quot; motor neurons control the arms, whilst &quot;lower&quot; motor neurons control the legs. The signs described above can occur in any muscle group, including the arms, legs, torso, and bulbar region. 

Symptoms usually present between the ages of 50-70, and include progressive weakness, muscle wasting, and muscle fasciculations; spasticity or stiffness in the arms and legs; and overactive tendon reflexes. Patients may present with symptoms as diverse as a dragging foot, unilateral muscle wasting in the hands, or slurred speech. 

The symptoms described above may resemble a number of other rare diseases, known as &quot;MND Mimic Disorders&quot;. These include, but are not limited to [[multifocal motor neuropathy]], [[kennedy's disease]], [[hereditary spastic paraplegia]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]] and [[monomelic amyotrophy]]. A small subset of familial MND cases occur in children, such as &quot;juvenile ALS&quot;, Madras syndrome, and individuals who have inherited the ALS2 gene. However, these are not typically referred to as MND, but by their specific names.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of MND is a clinical one, established by a neurologist on the basis of history and neurological examination. There is no diagnostic test for MND. Investigations such as blood tests, [[electromyography]] (EMG), [[magnetic resonance imaging]]  (MRI), and sometmies [[genetic testing]] are useful to rule out other disorders that may mimic MND. However, the diagnosis of MND remains a clinical one. Having excluded other diseases, a relatively rapid progression of symptoms is a strong diagnostic factor. Although an individual's progression may sometimes &quot;plateau&quot;, it will not recover or slow down. A set of diagnostic criteria called the El Escorial criteria have been defined by the World Federation of Neurologists for use in research, particularly as inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials. Due to a lack of clincial diagnostic criteria, some neurologists use the El Escorial criteria during the diagnostic process, although strictly speaking this is [[functionality creep]].

MND in the presence of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration is ALS. Where the illness affects only the upper motor neurons it is PLS, and where it affects only the lower motor neurons it is PMA. Progressive bulbar palsy is degneration of the lower motor neurons innervating the bulbar region (mouth, face, and throat), whilst pseudobulbar palsy refers to degeneration of the upper motor neurons to the same region.

==Prognosis==
Most cases of MND progess quite quickly, with noticeable decline occuring over the course of months. Although symptoms may present in one region, they will typically spread. If restricted to one side of the body they are more likely to progress to the same region on the other side of the body before progressing to a new region. After several years, most patients require help to carry out activities of daily living such as self care, feeding, and transportation. 

MND is typically fatal within 2-5 years. Around 50% die within 14 months of diagnosis. The remaining 50% will not necessarily die within the next 14 months as the distribution is significantly skewed. As a rough estimate, 1 in 5 patients survive for 5 years, and 1 in 10 patients survive 10 years. [[Stephen Hawking]] is a well-known example of a person with MND, and has lived for more than 40 years with the disease. 

Mortality results when the muscles that control breathing are no longer able to expel carbon dioxide. One exception is PLS, which may last for upwards of 25 years. Given the typical age of onset, this effectively leaves most PLS patients with a normal life span. PLS can progress to ALS, decades later.

==Pathology==
===Causes===
About 90% of cases of MND are &quot;sporadic&quot;, meaning that the patient has no family history of ALS and the case appears to have occurred with no known cause. Genetic factors are suspected to be important in determining an individual's susceptibility to disease, and there is some weak evidence to suggest that onset can be &quot;triggered&quot; by as yet unknown environmental factors (see 'Epidemiology' below). 
 
Approximately 10% of cases are &quot;familial MND&quot;, defined either by a family history of MND or by testing positive for a known genetic mutation associated with the disease. The following genes are known to be linked to ALS: Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase ''SOD1'', ''ALS2'', ''NEFH''(a small number of cases), senataxin (SETX) and vesicle associated protein B (''VAPB'').

Of these, SOD1 mutations account for some 20% of familial MND cases. The ''SOD1'' gene codes for the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] scavenger that reduces the [[oxidative stress]] of cells throughout the body. So far over 100 different mutations in the SOD1 gene have been found, all of which cause some form of ALS([http://www.alsod.org ALSOD database]). In North America, the most commonly occurring mutation is known as A4V and occurs in up to 50% of SOD1 cases. In people of [[Scandinavia]]n extraction there is a relatively benign mutation called D90A which is associated with a slow progression. Future research is concentrating on identifying new genetic mutations and the clinical syndrome associated with them. Familial MND may also confer a higher risk of developing cognitive changes such as frontotemporal dementia or executive dysfunction (see 'extra-motor change in MND' below).

It is thought that ''SOD1'' mutations confer a toxic gain, rather than a loss, of function to the enzyme. SOD1 mutations may increase the propensity for the enzyme to form protein aggregates which are toxic to nerve cells.

===Pathophysiology===
[[Skeletal muscle]]s are innervated by a group of neurons (''lower motor neurons'') located on the ventral surface of the spinal cord which project to the muscle cells. These nerve cells are themselves innervated by the corticospinal tract or ''upper motor neurons'' that project from the [[motor cortex]] of the brain. On macroscopic pathology, there is a degeneration of the ventral horns of the spinal cord, as well as atrophy of the ventral roots. In the brain, atrophy may be present in the frontal and temporal lobes. On microscopic examination, neurones may show spongiosis, the presence of astrocytes, and a number of inclusions including characteristic &quot;skein-like&quot; inclusions, bunina bodies, and vacuolisation. 

There is a role in excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, presumably secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction. In animal models, death by [[apoptosis]] has also been identified.

==Emotional lability / pseudobulbar affect==
{{main|labile affect}}

Around a third of all MND patients experiece [[labile affect]], also known as emotional lability, pseudobulbar affect, or pathological laughter and crying. Patients with pseudobulbar palsy are particuarly likely to be affected, as are patients with PLS. 

==Extra-motor change in MND==
[[Cognitive]] change can and does occur in between 33&amp;ndash;50% of patients. A small proportion exhibit a form of [[frontotemporal dementia]] characterised by behavioural abnormalities such as [[disinhibition]], [[apathy]], and personality changes. A small proportion of patients may also suffer from an [[aphasia]], which causes difficulty in naming specific objects. A larger proportion (up to 50%) suffer from a milder version of cognitive change which primarily affects what is known as [[executive function]]. Briefly, this is the ability of an individual to initiate, inhibit, sustain, and switch attention and is involved in the organisation of complex tasks down to smaller components. Often patients with such changes find themselves unable to do the family finances or drive a car. [[clinical depression|Depression]] is surprisingly rare in MND (around 5&amp;ndash;20%) relative to the frequency with which it is found in other, less severe, neurological disorders e.g. ~50% in [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], ~20% in Epilepsy.  Depression does not necessarily increase as the symptoms progress, and in fact many patients report being happy with their [[quality of life]] despite profound disability.  This may reflect the use of [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] such as reevaluating what is important in life.

Although traditionally thought only to affect the motor system, sensory abnormalities are not necessarily absent, with some patients finding altered sensation to touch and heat, found in around 10% of patients. Patients with a predominantly upper motor neurone syndrome, and particularly PLS, often report an enhanced startle reflex to loud noises.

Neuroimaging and neuropathology has demonstrated extra-motor changes in the frontal lobes including the inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal gyrus. The degree of pathology in these areas has been directly related to the degree of cognitive change experienced by the patient, if any. Patients with MND and dementia have been shown to exhibit marked frontotemporal lobe atrophy as revealed by [[MRI]] or [[SPECT]] [[neuroimaging]].

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of MND is approximately 1&amp;ndash;5 out of 100,000 people. Men have a slightly higher incidence rate than women. Approximately 5,600 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. every year. By far the greatest risk factor is age, with symptoms typically presenting between the ages of 50-70. Cases under the age of 50 years are called &quot;young onset MND&quot;, whilst incidence rates appear to tail off after the age of 85. 

Tentative environmental risk factors identified so far include: exposure to severe electrical shock leading to coma, having served in the first [[Gulf War]], and playing professional [[football (soccer)]]. However, these findings have not been firmly identified and more research is needed. 

There are three &quot;hot spots&quot; of MND in the world. One is in the Kii pensinula of Japan, one amongst a tribal population in Papua New Guinea. Until the 1960s, Chamorro inhabitants from the island of [[Guam]] in the [[Oceania|Pacific Ocean]] had an increased risk of developing a form of MND known as Guamanian ALS-PD-dementia complex or &quot;lytico bodig&quot;, but since then the incidence rates have returned to near normal, and nobody born since 1940 has developed the disease. Putative theories involve neurotoxins in local wildlife including [[cycad]] nuts and other traditional foodstuffs[http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2003/12/09/flying_fox_linked_to_disease/].

==Treatment==
Currently, there is no cure for ALS.  The only drug that affects the course of the disease is [[riluzole]]. The drug functions by blocking the effects of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and is thought to extend the lifespan of an ALS patient by only a few months.  

The lack of effective medications to slow the progression of ALS does not mean that patients with ALS cannot be medically cared for. Instead, treatment of patients with ALS focuses on the relief of symptoms associated with the disease. This involves a variety of health professionals including neurologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, respiratory therapists, social workers, palliative care specialists, specialist nurses and psychologists.  A list of neurology clinics that specialize in the care of patients with ALS can be found on the World Federation of Neurology website (http://www.wfnals.org/clinics/).

==Research Efforts==
The search for a drug that will slow ALS disease progression is underway. For example, recent research using mouse models suggests that [[minocycline]], a common antibiotic, may also be effective in extending the lifespan of ALS sufferers.  This drug must pass [[clinical trials]] with ALS patients before it may be used as a general treatment for ALS.   

[[Minocycline]] extends the lifespan of ALS mice with SOD1 mutations, but it does not prevent their eventual death. Other agents that are currently in trials include ceftriaxone, arimoclomol, IGF-1 and coenzyme Q10 to name but a few. A list of US-based clinical ALS trials may be found at www.clinicaltrials.org or by contacting your local ALS/MND charity.

==Etymology==
''Amyotrophic'' comes from the [[Greek language]]: ''A-'' means &quot;no&quot;, ''myo'' refers to &quot;muscle&quot;, and ''trophic'' means &quot;nourishment&quot;; ''amyotrophic'' therefore means &quot;no muscle nourishment,&quot; which describes the characteristic [[atrophy|atrophication]] of the sufferer's disused muscle tissue. ''Lateral'' identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that are affected are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening (&quot;[[sclerosis]]&quot;) in the region.

==History and prominent patients==
[[United States|U.S.]] baseball player [[Lou Gehrig]] brought national and international attention to the disease in [[1939]] when he abruptly retired after being diagnosed with ALS/MND; he would die two years later. Former guitar virtuoso [[Jason Becker]], [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]], and ex-[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] [[Football (soccer)|football]] player [[Jimmy Johnstone]] also suffer from the disease. 

Founder of care homes [[Leonard Cheshire]] VC, owner from 1957-1966 of [[Athelhampton]] House in Dorset Sir Robert Cooke F.R.C.S., [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Victor Emery]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] [[football (soccer)|football]]er [[Sam English]], [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[pitcher]] [[Catfish Hunter|Jim &quot;Catfish&quot; Hunter]], [[blues]] singer and guitarist [[Leadbelly]], [[China|Chinese]] Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], [[jazz]] giant [[Charles Mingus]], [[Hollywood]] actor [[David Niven]], legendary [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Don Revie]], teacher and book subject [[Morrie Schwartz]], American television actor [[Lane Smith]], linguist [[Larry Trask]], ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Jill Tweedie]], avant-garde guitarist [[Derek Bailey]], American [[soap opera]] veteran [[Michael Zaslow]], and libertarian writer, politician, and investment analyst, [[Harry Browne]] died from the disease.

[[Diane Pretty]] was a British woman with the disease who was involved in a prominent [[right-to-die]] case in the early [[2000s]].

An '''abjad''' is a type of [[writing system]] in which there is one symbol per [[consonant|consonantal]] [[phoneme]], sometimes also called a '''consonantary'''. Abjads differ from [[alphabet|alphabets]], in that in an abjad, each basic [[grapheme]] represents a consonant, although [[vowel]]s may be indicated by [[vowel mark]]s on the basic graphemes. An alphabet has basic graphemes for both consonants and vowels. Abjads also differ from [[abugida|abugidas]]. In an abjad, each basic grapheme represents only a consonant. In an abugida, each basic grapheme represents a syllable consisting of a consonant and a vowel; the same consonant with a different vowel -- or with no vowel -- is represented by a modified or marked form of the same basic grapheme.

==Etymology==
The system takes its name from the first nonsense 'word' of the mnemonic sequence for the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] in the older [[Arabic alphabet#Abjadi order|abjadi order]]. It has been suggested that the word 'Abjad' may have earlier roots in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] or [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]].

==History==
All known abjads belong to the Semitic family of scripts, and derive from the original Northern Linear Abjad. The reason for this is that [[Semitic languages]] have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphemic structure]] which makes the denotation of vowels redundant or unnecessary in most cases.

==Impure abjads==
&quot;Impure&quot; abjads (such as Arabic) may have characters for some vowels as well (called ''matres lectionis'', 'mothers of reading', singular [[ mater lectionis]]), or optional vowel diacritics, or both; however, the term's originator, [[Peter T. Daniels]], insists that it should be applied only to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators, thus excluding [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. 

Impure abjads develop when, due to [[phonetics|phonetic]] change, a previous [[consonant]] or [[diphthong]] becomes a vowel. Later generations, who receive their [[orthography]] without knowing that letter originally signified a consonant there, understand it to mean a [[vowel]] as it is in their spoken language. They then use that letter as a vowel in other places where it was never a consonant. For example, the Hebrew word ◊î◊ï◊®◊ô◊©◊Å probably underwent the following pronunciation change: {{unicode|*hi'''w'''ri É}} ‚Üí {{unicode|*ho'''w'''ri É}} ‚Üí {{unicode|h'''o'''ri É}}. The ◊ï, which was originally the consonant w, became the vowel o. Later, probably in the [[Second Temple]] period, the vowel use of ◊ï was expanded to places where no consonant ever existed.

===Addition of vowels===
Many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full [[alphabet]]s.  This has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non-Semitic language, the most famous case being the derivation of the [[Greek alphabet]] from the Phoenician abjad. The Greeks did not need the letters for the [[guttural consonant|guttural]] (&amp;#1488;, &amp;#1492;, &amp;#1495;, &amp;#1506;) and [[co-articulated consonant|co-articulated]] (&amp;#1510;, &amp;#1511;) consonants. They dropped some of them and turned others into vowels.

In other cases, the vowel signs come in the form of little points or hooks attached to the consonant letters, producing an [[abugida]] such as the system of writing [[Amharic]] (written using the Ge'ez alphabet, which was formerly an abjad before a vocalization occurred sometime after the 5th century BCE but before the 4th century CE).

==Related concepts==
Surprisingly, many non-Semitic languages such as English can be written without vowels and read with little difficulty. For example, the previous sentence could be written ''Srprsngly, mny nn-Smtc lnggs sch `s `nglsh cn b wrttn wtht vwls `nd rd wth lttl dffclty.'' This fact can be used to semi-bowdlerise offensive language, a practice known as [[disemvoweling]].

Some usages of [[1337speak]] drop vowels, especially for small words.

An '''abugida''', '''alphasyllabary''', or '''syllabics''' is a [[writing system]] composed of signs ([[grapheme]]s) denoting [[consonant]]s with an inherent following [[vowel]], which are consistently modified to indicate other vowels, or, in some cases, the lack of a vowel.  Examples include the various scripts of the [[Brahmic family]], Ethiopic [[Ge'ez language|Ge‚Äôez]], and [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]. 
 
A typical abugida is [[Devanagari]]. There is no basic sign representing the consonant ''k;'' rather the unmodified letter ‡§ï represents the syllable ''ka;'' the ''a'' is the so-called &quot;inherent&quot; vowel. The vowel may be changed by adding vowel marks to the basic character, producing other syllables beginning with ''k-,'' such as ‡§ï‡§ø ''ki'', ‡§ï‡•Å ''ku'', ‡§ï‡•á ''ke'',  ‡§ï‡•ã ''ko''.  These [[diacritic]]s are applied systematically to other consonantal characters. For example, from ‡§≤ ''la'' is formed ‡§≤‡§ø ''li'', ‡§≤‡•Å ''lu'', ‡§≤‡•á ''le'', ‡§≤‡•ã ''lo''. Such a consonant with either an inherent or marked vowel is called an [[akshara]]. 

In many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding the bare consonant. In Devanagari, ‡§ï‡•ç is ''k,'' and ‡§≤‡•ç is ''l''.  This is called the ''[[virama]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], or ''halant'' in [[Hindi]]. It may be used to form [[consonant cluster]]s, or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word.  Other means of expressing these functions include special [[conjunct]] forms in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster, such as Devanagari: ‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤ ''kla.'' (Note that on some fonts display this as ‡§ï‡•ç followed by ‡§≤, rather than forming a conjunct.)   
 
The diacritics may appear above (‡§ï‡•á), below (‡§ï‡•Å), to the left (‡§ï‡§ø), or to the right (‡§ï‡•ã) of the consonantal character, or may surround it as in [[Tamil script|Tamil]] ‡Æï‡Øå = ''kau,'' from ‡Æï ''ka''.  In many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like ‡§ø ''-i,'' falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced. For example, the game [[cricket]] in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] is ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ''krike≈£;'' the diacritic for /i/ appears before the [[consonant cluster]] /kr/, not before the /r/. A more unusual example is seen in the [[Batak alphabet]]: Here the syllable ''bim'' is written ''ba-ma-i-(virama)''. That is, the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable. 

In Ge‚Äôez, the prototype abugida, the form of the letter itself may be altered. For example, ·àÄ ''h√§'' (basic form), ·àÅ ''hu'' (with a right-side diacritic that does not alter the letter), ·àÇ ''hi'' (with a subdiacritic compresses the letter, so that the whole fidel (akshara) occupies the same amount of space), ·àÖ ''he'' (where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm). 

In the family of abugidas known as [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]], vowels are indicated by modification (rotation and reflection) of the akshara. For example, Inuktitut ·ê± ''pi,'' ·ê≥ ''pu,'' ·ê∏ ''pa;'' ·ëé ''ti,'' ·ëê ''tu,'' ·ëï ''ta''.

The [[R√≥ng]] script used for the [[Lepcha language]] goes further than other abugidas in that each akshara is a full syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable [sok] would written as something like {{IPA|sÃ•ÃΩ}}, here with an underring representing /o/ and an overcross representing the diacritic for final /k/. There are several abugidas of Indonesia which also indicate final consonants with diacritics, but usually these are restricted to one or two [[nasal consonant|nasals]] such as /≈ã/. 

The [[Pahawh Hmong]] script represents both consonants and vowels with full letters. However, the graphic order is vowel-consonant even though they are pronounced as consonant-vowel. This is rather like the /o/ vowel in the Indic abugidas. Pahawh Hmong is unusual in that, while the inherent vowel /au/ is unwritten, so is the inherent consonant /k/. For the syllable /kau/, which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is /au/ that is written. That is, a Pahawh akshara appears to be a vowel with an inherent consonant rather than the other way around. 

It is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] scrips. For example, the [[Meroitic script]] of ancient [[Sudan]] did not indicate an inherent ''a'' (one symbol stood for both ''m'' and ''ma,'' for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel. 

[[Thaana]] is also like an abugida in that vowels are marked with diacritics. However, all vowels are marked, as is the absence of a vowel; there is no inherent vowel. Normally no letter may occur without a diacritic. That is, it is equivalent to an [[abjad]] with obligatory vowel marking, like the [[Arabic alphabet]] as used for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in Iraq, as is thus essentially alphabetic. Note that it developed among a population that was already literate with an abugida for their language. 

Several systems of [[shorthand]] use diacritics for vowels, but they do not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to Thaana and Kurdish than to the Brahmic scripts. The [[Sam Pollard|Pollard]] script, which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. 

As the term ''alphasyllabary'' suggests, abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]]. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from [[abjad|abjads]] (vowelless alphabets).  They contrast with syllabaries, where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese [[hiragana]] syllabary: „Åã ''ka'', „Åç ''ki'', „Åè ''ku'', „Åë ''ke'', „Åì ''ko'' have nothing in common to indicate ''k;'' while „Çâ ''ra'', „Çä ''ri'', „Çã ''ru'', „Çå ''re'', „Çç ''ro'' have neither anything in common for ''r'', nor anything do indicate that they have the same vowels as the ''k'' set. 

The term ''abugida'' is taken from a conventional name for the Ge'ez script, derived from its first four letters (·ä†·â°·åä·ã≥) as ordered 
in some religious contexts.  This order corresponds to the ancestral [[Semitic]] character order, ''aleph, beth, gimel, daleth,'' or A B C D.

Historically, abugidas appear to have first evolved from abjads (perhaps [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]) with the [[Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´]] and [[BrƒÅhmƒ´]] scripts. The Kharosthi family does not survive today, but Brahmi's descendents include most of the modern scripts of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Canadian Syllabics was derived from Devanagari, and is thus in the Brahmic family, or was at least influenced by Devanagari in its creation. Although Ge‚Äôez derived from a different abjad, its evolution into an abugida may have been due to the influence of Christian missionaries from India.

AIDS is the most severe manifestation of infection with HIV. HIV is a [[retrovirus]] that primarily infects vital components of the human [[immune system]] such as CD4+ [[T cell]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. It also directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough CD4+ cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system barely works, leading to AIDS. Acute HIV infection progresses over time to clinical latent HIV infection and then to early symptomatic HIV infection and later, to AIDS, which is identified on the basis of the amount of [[CD4]] positive cells in the blood and the presence of certain infections.

===AIDS and HIV case definitions===
Since June 18, 1981, many different definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the [[Bangui definition]] and the [[1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition]]. However, these were never intended to be used for clinical staging of patients, for which they are neither sensitive nor specific. The [[World Health Organization]]s (WHO) staging system for HIV infection and disease, using clinical and laboratory data, can be used in developing countries and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) Classification System can be used in developed nations. 

====WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease====
{{main|WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease}}
In 1990, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) grouped these infections and conditions together by introducing a staging system for patients infected with HIV-1 &lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{

In the [[USA]], the definition of AIDS is governed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). In 1993, the CDC expanded their definition of AIDS to include healthy HIV positive people with a CD4 positive T cell count of less than 200 per ¬µl of blood.

===HIV test===
{{main|HIV test}}
Approximately half of those infected with HIV don't know that they are infected until they are diagnosed with AIDS. HIV test kits are used to screen donor blood and blood products, and to diagnose HIV in individuals. Typical HIV tests, including the HIV enzyme immunoassay and the Western blot assay, detect HIV antibodies in serum, plasma, oral fluid, dried blood spot or urine of patients.  Other tests to look for HIV antigens, HIV-RNA, and HIV-DNA are also commercially available and can be used to detect HIV infection prior to the development of detectable antibodies.  However, these assays are not specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of HIV infection.

==Symptoms and Complications==
[[Image:Hiv-timecourse.png|400px|thumb|right|A generalized graph of the relationship between HIV copies (viral load) and CD4 counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection; any particular individuals' disease course may vary considerably.]]
The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy [[immune system]]s. Most of these conditions are infections caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus|viruses]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[parasite]]s that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages. [[Opportunistic infection]]s are common in people with AIDS &lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, the specific opportunistic infections that AIDS patients develop depends in part on the prevalence of these infections in the geographic area in which the patient lives.

===The major pulmonary illnesses===
*'''''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia''': [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia]] (originally known as ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia, often abbreviated PCP) is relatively rare in normal, [[immunocompetent]] people but common among HIV-infected individuals. Before the advent of effective treatment and diagnosis in Western countries it was a common immediate cause of death. In developing countries, it is still one of the first indications of AIDS in untested individuals, although it does not generally occur unless the CD4 count is less than 200 per ¬µl &lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15735422}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

*'''Tuberculosis''': Among infections associated with HIV, [[tuberculosis]] (TB) is unique in that it may be transmitted to immunocompetent persons via the respiratory route, is easily treatable once identified, may occur in early-stage HIV disease, and is preventable with drug therapy. However, multi-drug resistance is a potentially serious problem. Even though its incidence has declined because of the use of directly observed therapy and other improved practices in Western countries, this is not the case in developing countries where HIV is most prevalent. In early-stage HIV infection (CD4 count &amp;gt;300 cells per ¬µl), TB typically presents as a pulmonary disease. In advanced HIV infection, TB may present atypically and extrapulmonary TB is common infecting [[bone marrow]], [[bone]], urinary and [[gastrointestinal tract]]s, liver, regional lymph nodes, and the central nervous system &lt;ref name=Decker&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===The major gastro-intestinal illnesses===
* '''Esophagitis''': [[Esophagitis]] is an inflammation of the lining of the lower end of the [[esophagus]] (gullet or swallowing tube leading to the stomach). In HIV infected individuals, this could be due to fungus ([[candidiasis]]), virus ([[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex-1]] or [[cytomegalovirus]]). In rare cases, it could be due to [[mycobacteria]] &lt;ref name=Zaidi&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

* '''Unexplained chronic diarrhea''': In HIV infection, there are many possible causes of [[diarrhea]], including common bacterial (''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', or ''[[Escherichia coli]]'') and parasitic infections, and uncommon opportunistic infections such as [[cryptosporidiosis]], [[microsporidiosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]'' complex (MAC) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. Diarrhea may follow a course of antibiotics (common for ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''). It may also be a side effect of several drugs used to treat HIV, or it may simply accompany HIV infection, particularly during primary HIV infection. In the later stages of HIV infection, diarrhea is thought to be a reflection of changes in the way the intestinal tract absorbs nutrients, and may be an important component of HIV-related wasting &lt;ref name=Guerrant&gt;{{

===The major neurological illnesses===
* '''Toxoplasmosis''': [[Toxoplasmosis]] is a disease caused by the single-celled parasite called ''Toxoplasma gondii''. ''T. gondii'' usually infects the brain causing toxoplasma encephalitis. It can also infect and cause disease in the eyes and lungs &lt;ref name=Luft&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy''': [[Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) is a [[demyelinating disease]], in which the [[myelin]] sheath covering the [[axons]] of nerve cells is gradually destroyed, impairing the transmission of nerve impulses. It is caused by a virus called [[JC virus]] which occurs in 70% of the population in [[latent]] form, causing disease only when the immune system has been severly weakened, as is the case for AIDS patients. It progresses rapidly, usually causing death within months of diagnosis &lt;ref name=Sadler&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several of these, [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], high-grade [[lymphoma]], and [[cervical cancer]] confer a diagnosis of AIDS when they occur in an HIV-infected person.
   
* '''Kaposi's sarcoma:''' [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] is the most common tumor in HIV-infected patients.  The appearance of this tumor in young gay men in 1981 was one of the first signals of the AIDS epidemic.  It is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus]] (KSHV).  It often appears as purplish nodules on the skin, but other organs, especially the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs can be affected.

* '''High-grade lymphoma:''' Several high-grade B cell lymphomas have substantially increased incidence in HIV-infected patients and often portend a poor prognosis.  The most common AIDS-defining lymphomas are [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], Burkitt's-like lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including primary central nervous system lymphoma.  [[Primary effusion lymphoma]] is less common.  Many of these lymphomas are caused by either [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) or KSHV.

* '''Cervical cancer:''' [[Cervical cancer]] in HIV-infected women is also considered AIDS-defining.  It is caused by [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).

* '''Other tumors:''' In addition to the AIDS-defining tumors listed above, HIV-infected patients are also at increased risk of certain other tumors, such as [[Hodgkin's disease]] and [[anal carcinoma|anal]] and [[rectal carcinoma|rectal carcinomas]].  However, the incidence of many common tumors, such as [[breast cancer]] or [[colon cancer]], are not increased in HIV-infected patients.  Most AIDS-associated malignancies are caused by co-infection of patients with an oncogenic DNA virus, especially [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] (KSHV), and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).  In areas where [[HAART]] is extensively used to treat AIDS, the incidence of many AIDS-related malignancies has decreased, but at the same time malignancies overall have become the most common cause of death of HIV-infected patients &lt;ref name=Bonnet&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15241829}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Other opportunistic infections===
Patients with AIDS and severe immunosuppression often develop opportunistic infections that present with non-specific symptoms, especially low grade fevers and weight loss.  These include infection with ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]-intracellulare'' and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV). CMV can also cause colitis, as described above, and CMV retinitis can cause blindness. [[Penicilliosis]] due to ''[[Penicillium marneffei]]'' is now the third most common opportunistic infection (after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and cryptococcosis) in HIV-positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia &lt;ref name=Skoulidis&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15286196}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Transmission==
Since the beginning of the [[epidemic]], three main transmission routes of HIV have been identified:

* '''Sexual route.''' The majority of HIV infections have been, and still are, acquired through unprotected sexual relations. Sexual transmission occurs when there is contact between sexual secretions of one partner with the rectal, genital or mouth [[Mucous membrane|mucous membranes]] of another.

* '''Blood or blood product route.''' This transmission route is particularly important for intravenous drug users, [[Haemophilia|hemophiliac]]s and recipients of [[blood transfusion]]s and blood products. Health care workers (nurses, laboratory workers, doctors etc) are also concerned, although more rarely. Also concerned by this route are people who give and receive tattoos and piercings.

* '''Mother-to-child route (vertical transmission).''' The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur ''in utero'' during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth. Breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby. In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother and child was 20%. However, where treatment is available, combined with the availability of [[Cesarian section]], this has been reduced to 1%.

HIV has been found in the [[saliva]], [[tears]] and [[urine]] of infected individuals, but due to the low concentration of virus in these biological liquids, the risk is considered to be negligible.

The diverse transmission routes of HIV are well-known and established. Also well-known is how to prevent transmission of HIV. However, recent epidemiological and behavioral studies in Europe and North America have suggested that a substantial minority of young people continue to engage in high-risk practices and that despite HIV/AIDS knowledge, young people underestimate their own risk of becoming infected with HIV &lt;ref name=Dias&gt;{{

===Prevention of sexual transmission of HIV===
====Underlying science====
Unprotected receptive sexual acts are at more risk than unprotected insertive sexual acts, with the risk for transmitting HIV from an infected partner to an uninfected partner through unprotected insertive anal intercourse greater than the risk for transmission through vaginal intercourse or oral sex. Oral sex is not without its risks as it has been established that HIV can be transmitted through both insertive and receptive oral sex &lt;ref name=Rothenberg&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|9833850}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Sexually-transmitted infection]]s (STI) increase the risk of HIV transmission and infection because they cause the disruption of the normal epithelial barrier by genital ulceration and/or microulceration; and by accumulation of pools of HIV-susceptible or HIV-infected cells ([[lymphocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s) in semen and vaginal secretions. Epidemiological studies from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and North America have suggested that there is approximately a four times greater risk of becoming HIV-infected in the presence of a genital ulcer such as caused by [[syphilis]] and/or [[chancroid]]; and a significant though lesser increased risk in the presence of STIs such as [[gonorrhoea]], [[chlamydia]]l infection and [[trichomoniasis]] which cause local accumulations of lymphocytes and macrophages &lt;ref name=Laga&gt;{{

Transmission of HIV depends on the infectiousness of the [[index case]] and the susceptibility of the uninfected partner. Infectivity seems to vary during the course of illness and is not constant between individuals. An undetectable plasma viral load does not mean that you have a low viral load in the seminal liquid or genital secretions. Each 10 fold increment of seminal HIV RNA is associated with an 81% increased rate of HIV transmission &lt;ref name=Laga&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, people who are infected with HIV can still be infected by other, more virulent strains.

====Prevention strategies====
During a sexual act, only [[condom]]s, be they male or female, can reduce the chances of infection with HIV and other STIs and the chances of becoming pregnant. They must be used during all penetrative sexual intercourse with a partner who is HIV positive or whose status is unknown &lt;ref name=Cayley&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15508535}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The effective use of condoms and screening of blood transfusion in North America, Western and Central Europe is credited with the low rates of AIDS in these regions. 

Promoting condom use, however, has often proved controversial and difficult. Many religious groups, most visibly the [[Roman Catholic Church]], have opposed the use of condoms on religious grounds, and have sometimes seen condom promotion as an affront to the promotion of marriage, monogamy and sexual morality. Other religious groups have argued that preventing HIV infection is a moral task in itself and that condoms are therefore acceptable or even praiseworthy from a religious point of view. 

[[Image:ThreeColoredRolledUpCondoms.jpg|thumb|right|Condoms in many colors]]
''The male latex condom'' is the single most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In order to be effective, they must be used correctly during each sexual act. Lubricants containing oil, such as petroleum jelly, or butter, must not be used as they weaken [[latex]] condoms and make them porous. If necessary, lubricants made from water are recommended. However, it is not recommended to use a lubricant for fellatio. Also, condoms have standards and expiration dates. It is essential to check the expiration date and if it conforms to European (EC 600) or American (D3492) standards before use. 

''[[Condom#Female condoms|The female condom]]'' is an alternative to the male condom and is made from [[polyurethane]], which allows it to be used in the presence of oil-based lubricants. They are larger than male condoms and have a stiffened ring-shaped opening, and are designed to be inserted into the vagina. The female condom also contains an inner ring which keeps the condom in place inside the vagina - inserting the female condom requires squeezing this ring.  
With consistent and correct use of condoms, there is a very low risk of HIV infection. Studies on couples where one partner is infected show that with consistent condom use, HIV infection rates for the uninfected partner are below 1% per year &lt;ref name=WHOCondoms&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Governmental programs====
The U.S. government and U.S. health organizations both endorse the '''''ABC Approach''''' to lower the risk of acquiring AIDS during sex:

: '''A'''bstinence or delay of sexual activity, especially for youth,
: '''B'''eing faithful, especially for those in committed relationships,
: '''C'''ondom use, for those who engage in risky behavior.

This approach has been very successful in [[Uganda]], where HIV prevalence has decreased from 15% to 5%. However, the ABC approach is far from all that Uganda has done, as &quot;''Uganda has pioneered approaches towards reducing stigma, bringing discussion of sexual behavior out into the open, involving HIV-infected people in public education, persuading individuals and couples to be tested and counseled, improving the status of women, involving religious organizations, enlisting traditional healers, and much more.''&quot; (Edward Green, [[Harvard]] medical anthropologist). Also, it must be noted that there is no conclusive proof that abstinence-only programs have been successful in any country in the world in reducing HIV transmission. This is why condom use is heavily co-promoted. There is also considerable overlap with the '''''CNN Approach'''''. This is:

: '''C'''ondom use, for those who engage in risky behavior.
: '''N'''eedles, use clean ones
: '''N'''egotiating skills; negotiating safer sex with a partner and empowering women to make smart choices

The '''ABC approach''' has been criticized, because a faithful partner of an unfaithful partner is at risk of AIDS &lt;ref name=EconomistABC&gt;{{

===Prevention of blood or blood product route of HIV transmission===
====Underlying science====
Sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood represents a major risk for infection with not only HIV but also [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]]. In the United States a third of all new HIV infections can be traced to needle sharing and almost 50% of long-term addicts have hepatitis C. The risk of being infected with HIV from a single prick with a needle that has been used on an HIV infected person though is thought to be about 1 in 150 ([[AIDS#Prevention|see table above]]). [[Post-exposure prophylaxis]] with anti-HIV drugs can further reduce that small risk &lt;ref name=Fan&gt;{{

In countries where improved donor selection and antibody tests have been introduced, the risk of transmitting [[HIV]] infection to [[blood transfusion]] recipients is extremely low. But according to the [[WHO]], the overwhelming majority of the world's population does not have access to safe blood and &quot;between 5% and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood products&quot; &lt;ref name=WHO070401&gt;{{

Medical workers who follow [[universal precautions]] or body substance isolation such as wearing latex gloves when giving injections and washing the hands frequently can help prevent infection of HIV. 

All AIDS-prevention organizations advise drug-users not to share needles and other material required to prepare and take drugs (including syringes, cotton balls, the spoons, water for diluting the drug, straws, crack pipes etc). It is important that people use new or properly sterilized needles for each injection. Information on cleaning needles using bleach is available from health care and addiction professionals and from [[needle exchange]]s. In the United States and some other countries, clean needles are available free in some cities, at needle exchanges or [[safe injection site]]s. Additionally, many states within the United States and some other nations have decriminalized needle possession and made it possible to buy injection equipment from pharmacists without a prescription.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In developed countries the risk can of transmission of HIV from mother to child can be as low as 0-5%.  A number of factors influence the risk of infection, particularly the viral load of the mother at birth (the higher the load, the higher the risk). Breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission by 10‚Äì15%. This risk depends on clinical factors and may vary according to the pattern and duration of breastfeeding.

Current optimal HAART options consist of combinations (or &quot;cocktails&quot;) consisting of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types, or &quot;classes,&quot; of [[anti-retroviral]] agents.  Typical regimens consist of two [[nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs) plus either a [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] or a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).

Research to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs, further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence, and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance.

A number of studies have shown that measures to prevent opportunistic infections can be beneficial when treating patients with HIV infection or AIDS.  Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for patients who are not infected with these viruses and are at risk of getting infected.  In addition, AIDS patients should receive vaccination against [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] and should receive yearly vaccination against [[influenza virus]].  Patients with substantial immunosuppression are generally advised to receive prophylactic therapy for [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia]] (PCP), and many patients may benefit from prophylactic therapy for [[toxoplasmosis]] and [[Cryptococcus]] meningitis.  

===Alternative medicine===
Ever since AIDS entered the public consciousness, various forms of [[alternative medicine]] have been used to try to treat symptoms or to try to affect the course of the disease itself. In the first decade of the epidemic when no useful conventional treatment was available, a large number of people with AIDS experimented with [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]]. The definition of &quot;alternative therapies&quot; in AIDS has changed since that time. During that time, the phrase often referred to community-driven treatments, not being tested by government or pharmaceutical company research, that some hoped would directly suppress the virus or stimulate immunity against it. These kinds of approaches have become less common over time as AIDS drugs have become more effective. 

The phrase then and now also refers to other approaches that people hoped would improve their symptoms or their quality of life--for instance, massage, herbal and flower remedies and [[acupuncture]]; when used with conventional treatment, many now refer to these as &quot;complementary&quot; approaches. None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS directly. However, some may improve feelings of well-being in people who believe in their value. Additionally, people with AIDS, like people with other illnesses such as [[cancer]], also sometimes use [[marijuana]] to treat pain, combat nausea and stimulate appetite.

[[UNAIDS]] and the WHO estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. Despite recent, improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3.1 million (between 2.8 and 3.6 million) lives in 2005 of which more than half a million (570,000) were children &lt;ref name=UNAIDS&gt;{{

The development of [[HAART]] as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS has substantially reduced the death rate from this disease in those areas where it is widely available. This has created the misperception that the disease has gone away. In fact, as the life expectancy of persons with AIDS has increased in countries where HAART is widely used, the number of persons living with AIDS has increased substantially.  In the United States, for example, the number of persons with AIDS increased from about 35,000 in 1988 to over 220,000 in 1996 &lt;ref name=CDC1996&gt;{{

==Origin of HIV/AIDS==
{{main|AIDS origin}}
The official date for the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is marked as [[June 18]], [[1981]], when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] and Prevention reported a cluster of [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia]] (now classified as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) in five gay men in [[Los Angeles]] &lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{

  | accessdate=2006-01-17

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Originally dubbed GRID, or Gay-Related [[Immunodeficiency|Immune Deficiency]], health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not gay. In 1982, the CDC introduced the term AIDS to describe the newly recognized syndrome.

Three of the earliest known instances of HIV infection are as follows:

Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to [[West Africa]] &lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are of primate origin.  The origin of HIV-1 is the [[Common Chimpanzee|Central Common Chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes''). The origin of HIV-2 has been established to be the [[Sooty Mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys''), an Old World monkey of Guinea Bissau, Gabon, and Cameroon.

One currently controversial possibility for the origin of HIV/AIDS was discussed in a [[1992]] Rolling Stone magazine article by freelance journalist Tom Curtis.  He put forward the theory that AIDS was inadvertantly caused in the late 1950's in the [[Belgian Congo]] by [[Hilary Koprowski]]'s research into a [[polio]] [[vaccine]] &lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although subsequently retracted due to [[libel]] issues surrounding its claims, the Rolling Stone article motivated another freelance journalist, [[Edward Hooper]], to probe more deeply into this subject.   Hooper's research resulted in his publishing a 1999 book, [[The River]], in which he alleged that an experimental oral [[polio]] [[vaccine]] prepared using  [[chimpanzee]] kidney tissue was the route through which [[SIV]] crossed into humans to become HIV, thus starting the

'''ABBA''' ([[1972]]‚Äì[[1983]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pop music]] group. They remain the most successful Swedish music act and were one of the most popular groups in the world. The group dominated charts worldwide during the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, selling many [[ABBA discography|hit singles and albums]]. Estimates of ABBA's total worldwide sales vary from 300 to 400 million (there seems to be no reliable source for this information) which could make them the second most successful band of all time after [[The Beatles]]. They were the first act from the European mainland to become a regular fixture in [[UK Singles Chart|British]], [[Hot 100 Singles Sales|American]] and [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] charts, and their success subsequently opened the doors for many other European acts. Their lasting legacy is the legitimising of the Swedish music industry as a mainstream player.

ABBA was formed around [[1972]] with [[Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus]], [[Benny Andersson]], [[Agnetha F√§ltskog]], and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] (nicknamed &quot;Frida&quot;). They became widely known after winning the [[1974]] [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with &quot;[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]&quot;. The group consisted of two couples, Bj√∂rn and Agnetha along with Benny and Frida. ABBA collectively decided to take a break at the beginning of [[1983]]. They have yet to record together again in the studio.
 
''ABBA'' is an [[acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's name. It is usually written '''ABBA''' but is sometimes written as a word, '''Abba'''. The first ''B'' in the [[logo]] version of the name was reversed on the band's promotional material from [[1976]] onwards.

==History==
===Before ABBA===
Benny Andersson was a member of the Swedish rock / pop band [[Hep Stars]] who were very popular in Sweden during the 1960s. The band was modeled after various US and UK groups such as [[Herman's Hermits]], [[The Who]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The Hep Stars had a huge following, especially among teenage girls. Meanwhile Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus was fronting a [[skiffle]] group called the [[Hootenanny Singers]] whose sound was softer and more easy-listening than the Hep Stars. The singers crossed paths sometimes and they decided to write songs together. One of these, &quot;Isn't It Easy To Say,&quot; became a hit for the Hep Stars and Bj√∂rn sometimes guested with the band on tour. It was even suggested that the two bands merge but this never happened. [[Stikkan Anderson|Stig Anderson]], manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of [[Polar Music]], saw more potential in Benny and Bj√∂rn working together and encouraged them to write more songs and create an album which was eventually called ''Lycka'' (&quot;Happiness&quot;) when released on the Polar label.

Agnetha F√§ltskog was ABBA's youngest member and a pop phenomenon in her own right who wrote and performed Swedish hits while in her teens and had also played [[Mary Magdalene]] in the Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. Agnetha was noted by critics and songwriters as an accomplished composer but she considered it hard work, writing and performing light pop songs in the [[Schlager]] style, recording [[cover version|covers]] of hit songs and touring Swedish [[folkpark]]s, the main &quot;live circuit&quot; at that time. Inevitably she bumped into the Hootenanny Singers on their folkpark tours, meeting and eventually falling in love with Bj√∂rn. Their marriage in [[1971]] was the Swedish celebrity wedding of the year and drew much publicity.

Housewife Anni-Frid &quot;Frida&quot; Lyngstad was a part-time cabaret singer who decided to enter a talent competition and won. Sweden was [[Dagen H|changing over]] from driving on the left side of the road to the right and a series of spectacular shows was being aired to encourage people to stay off the roads on the night of the switchover. Invited to appear on TV that evening with her winning song, Frida's musical career took off. She met Benny Andersson on the wonted folkpark tour. They became lovers and Benny invited Anni-Frid to sing backing vocals with Agnetha on the ''Lycka'' album. The two women were uncredited for this work.

===Early years===
[[Image:People_Need_Love_small.jpg|frame|right|The cover of &quot;People Need Love,&quot; the first single released by the group.]]

By the early 1970s, although Bj√∂rn and Agnetha were married, they pursued their own separate musical careers. However Stig was ambitious and determined to break into the mainstream international market, not something that Swedish acts were usually known for, though previously achieved by Swedish instrumental guitar group [[The Spotnicks]] (their best known hit was &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;). As a result he encouraged Bj√∂rn and Benny to write a song for the [[1972]] [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and it was performed by Lena Anderson. &quot;Say It With a Song&quot; won third in the contest selection rounds but was a huge hit in several countries, convincing Stig he was on the right track.

Bj√∂rn and Benny persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements which brought some success in [[Japan]]. One of the songs they came up with was &quot;[[People Need Love]],&quot; featuring guest vocals by the girls who were now given much greater prominence than previously. Everyone involved felt enthusiastic about the new sound and Stig released it as a single, credited to ''Bj√∂rn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid''. The record reached number 17 in the Swedish charts, enough to convince them they were on to something.


[[Image:Ringring1973sleeve.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The cover of the [[1973]] version of the album ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''.]]

The following year they decided to have another crack at Eurovision, this time with the song &quot;[[Ring Ring (English version)|Ring Ring]].&quot; The studio work was handled by [[Michael B. Tretow]] who experimented with a [[Phil Spector]]-like &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; production technique that became the wholly new ABBA sound. Stig arranged an English translation of the lyrics by [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Phil Cody]] and they thought this would be a sure-fire winner. Yet again, it came in third. Nevertheless the proto-group put out an album called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]'', still carrying the awkward naming of ''Bj√∂rn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida''. The album did well and the &quot;Ring Ring&quot; single was a hit in many parts of Europe but Stig felt the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit.

Around this time Stig, having tired of the unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ''ABBA''. This was done as a joke at first, since Abba was also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden. However, since the fish canners were more or less unknown outside Sweden, Stig came to believe the name would work in international markets and so it stuck. Later the group negotiated with the canners for the right to use the name.

===Eurovision and after===
[[Image:Waterloo Watch Out.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&quot;[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]&quot; ([[1974]])]]
[[Image:Mammamiasingle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&quot;[[Mamma Mia]]&quot; ([[1975]])]]
They tried [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] again in [[1974]], now inspired by the growing [[glam rock]] scene in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and tracks like [[Wizzard]]'s &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot;. &quot;Waterloo&quot; was an unashamedly glam-style pop track produced with Michael B. Tretow's wall of sound approach. Now far more experienced, they were better prepared for the contest and had an album's worth of material released when the show was held in [[Brighton, England]]. The song won hands down and catapulted them into British consciousness for the first time. Now they had a catchy name, ABBA, and people could buy the whole album (''Waterloo'') straightaway.

&quot;[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]&quot;  was ABBA's first UK No. 1. It was also released in the [[United States|US]], reaching No. 6. But momentum proved hard to maintain, and their follow-up singles &quot;So Long&quot; and &quot;Honey Honey&quot; did not do nearly as well. The group was overstretched and unable to promote the songs convincingly in any one country. Moreover, much of their material was still heavily derivative. It wasn't until the release of their second proper album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and their single &quot;[[SOS (song)|SOS]]&quot; that ABBA began to show the first signs they were destined for bigger things. &quot;SOS&quot; consolidated ABBA's presence in the UK where it was a Top 10 hit and they were no longer regarded as a [[one-hit wonder]].

Much wider success came in [[1975]] with every release charting solidly and &quot;[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]&quot; reaching the UK No. 1 spot in January [[1976]]. 

At this time the band released the somewhat hubristically titled ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album despite having had only five Top 40 hits in the UK and the US. This album included &quot;[[Fernando (single)|Fernando]]&quot;  (an earlier version had been a Swedish-language hit single for Anni-Frid and included on her 1975 Benny-produced solo LP ''[[Frida Ensam]]''). Becoming one of ABBA's best-known tracks, &quot;Fernando&quot; did not appear on the Swedish or Australian releases of ''Greatest Hits''. In Sweden the song would wait until 1982's ''The Singles-The First Ten Years'' to appear in an English-language version credited to ABBA; the track was later included in the Australian release of their [[1976]] album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA_album)|Arrival]]''.

The next album, ''Arrival'', represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work for ABBA. Hit after hit flowed from it: &quot;[[Money, Money, Money]]&quot;, &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You (single)|Knowing Me, Knowing You]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dancing Queen (single)|Dancing Queen]]&quot;, their most enduring and definitive hit. By this time ABBA were widely popular in the UK, most of Western Europe and [[Australia]] (who in a way almost &quot;adopted&quot; ABBA as their own) but still had only moderate recognition and airplay in the US, and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; remains the only No. 1 ABBA ever achieved there.

[[Image:abbamovieposter.jpg|thumb|right|Movie poster for ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'' and ''[[The Album]]'' carried the same artwork.]]
By this time the ABBA sound was synonymous with European pop and was widely copied by groups like [[Brotherhood of Man]] and later, [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]]. Some felt it was necessary to copy ABBA's sound and two girl/two boy approach to win Eurovision, and the notion seemed validated when Brotherhood of Man won in 1976 and Bucks Fizz took the prize in [[1981]]. 

Meanwhile in [[1977]] ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more complex ''[[The Album]]'' which was released to coincide with ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', a feature film of their Australian tour. This album was less well-received by the critics but spawned several hits, &quot;[[The Name of the Game]]&quot; and &quot;[[Take A Chance On Me|Take a Chance on Me]]&quot;, both of which topped the UK charts. This album also carried the well-known &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; that later was released in the UK as a single ([[1983]]) and had been a B-side of &quot;Eagle&quot; in territories where that song was released as a single.

===Later years===
By [[1978]] ABBA was a megagroup. They converted a disused cinema into the Polar Music Studio, a new state-of-the-art studio in [[Stockholm]] which was used by several other successful bands ([[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' was recorded there, for example). 

Their standalone single &quot;[[Summer Night City]]&quot;, their last Swedish number one, stopped just short of topping the UK charts but set the stage for ABBA's foray into [[disco]] with the album ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', which was released in Spring [[1979]]. This release marked a slight decline in ABBA's popularity in the UK and Europe but gained them more attention in the US. The hits still came: &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot;, &quot;[[Does Your Mother Know]]&quot;, &quot;[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Have A Dream (ABBA song)|I Have A Dream]]&quot; all charted. In January 1979, the group performed at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]], performing &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot;; the [[royalties]] from the song were donated to [[UNICEF]].

Later that year, the group released their second greatest hits album, Greatest Hits Vol 2, which featured a brand new track &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot;, their best known [[disco]] hit.

In [[1979]] ABBA toured the US and Canada, playing to huge audiences, but the breakthrough there was perhaps too little, too late. 

[[1980]]'s ''[[Super Trouper]]'' reflected a change in ABBA's style with more prominent [[synthesiser]]s and more personal lyrics. It set a record for the most preorders ever received for a UK album after 1 million copies were ordered before release. Anticipation for the release had been built up by &quot;[[The Winner Takes It All]]&quot;, the group's eighth UK chart topper (their first since [[1978]]). This song was allegedly written about Bjorn and Agnetha's marriage, which was breaking down at the time. The next single from the album, &quot;[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]&quot; also hit number 1. &quot;[[Lay All Your Love On Me]]&quot; was an album track that was released in 1981 as a 12-inch single only in limited territories, and, along with Super Trouper, managed to top the American club and dance chart. A Spanish language compilation album was also recorded at this time - 'Gracias Por La Musica', which was released in Latin America and sold very well.

''[[The Visitors]]'' ([[1981]]), their final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placed the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies.  ''The Visitors''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; title track refers to secret meetings held against the approval of Communist governments in Soviet satellite states and other tracks address topics like aging, loss of innocence, a parent watching her child grow up and so on. Their melodies were still catchy but their change of style was reflected by the start of a commercial decline after their final great pop single &quot;[[One Of Us (ABBA song)|One Of Us]]&quot; which was a worldwide hit in December 1981.

Although by this time regarded as a group in decline, ABBA still drew huge audiences, particularly in continental Europe and might have gone on indefinitely if it were not for the band's personal turmoils: the two married couples were both divorced by this point. Songs like &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; and &quot;One Of Us&quot; gave glimpses of personal issues ABBA's members were facing. 

In summer 1982, the group gathered to record a new album. In the end they settled for a double album compilation of all their past successes with two new songs. The double album ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]'' topped the UK album chart and was a worldwide bestseller. The new tracks were &quot;[[Under Attack]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot;, which was the last song ABBA ever recorded together. Two other songs were recorded during 1982, &quot;I Am The City&quot; and &quot;Just Like That&quot;. While both were completed, only &quot;I Am The City&quot; was released on the compilation album ''More ABBA Gold'' in 1993. Despite numerous efforts from fans, Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson are still refusing to release &quot;[[Just Like That (ABBA song)|Just Like That]]&quot; in its entirety.

The group gradually drifted apart as they began pursuing different projects. Benny and Bj√∂rn collaborated with [[Tim Rice]] to write the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while Agnetha and Frida worked on solo albums.

==After ABBA==
Bj√∂rn and Benny wrote the music for the [[West End]] show ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' ([[1984]]) with lyricist [[Tim Rice]]. ''Chess'' ran for three years in London. The show also opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the US ([[1988]]) but the song order, lyrics and storyline had been altered compared with the London version, and was less successful; the show closed within weeks. &quot;Chess&quot; is best known today for producing the international hit &quot;[[One Night in Bangkok]]&quot;, sung by [[Murray Head]].

Bj√∂rn and Benny, inspired by the successes of Rice and his former collaborator [[Andrew Lloyd-Webber]], had long expressed their desire to write a musical. Their first attempt had been a &quot;mini-musical&quot;, ''The Girl with The Golden Hair'', performed by the group during their 1977 tour of Europe and Australia. Excerpts were included in ''ABBA - The Movie'' and ''ABBA - The Album''. Bj√∂rn and Benny followed ''Chess'' with ''[[Kristina fr√•n Duvem√•la]]'' ([[1995]]), directed for the stage by [[Lars Rudolfsson]] and based on the ''Emigrants'' [[tetralogy]] by Swedish novelist [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', a musical built around ABBA's songs, had its London premiere in [[1999]]. In 2003, their first musical was given new life in a Swedish-language version, ''Chess P√• Svenska''.

After being largely forgotten throughout most of the 1980s, ABBA experienced a resurgence. The attention was often ironic, along the lines of &quot;they were so [[wikt:naff|naff]] they were good,&quot; yet others recognised that while ABBA was often panned by critics and sneered at by [[punk rock|punk]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] musicians they were masters of their art, the three minute pop song. [[1992]] saw a huge revival of interest in ABBA, with the release of their [[ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]] compilation album selling massively worldwide and setting chart longevity records. The revival was further validated by the [[1994]] film &quot;[[Muriel's Wedding]]&quot;, a popular Australian film starring an ABBA-loving protaganist.  Bj√∂rn and Benny were finally recognised in [[2001]] with an [[Ivor Novello|Ivor Novello Award]] for their songwriting. Many former punk and New Wave artistes later admitted to levels of fondness and respect for ABBA they were unwilling to own up to in their early years.

During the 1990s many ABBA tracks were rediscovered and covered by other artists, such as [[Erasure]], [[Ash (band)|Ash]] and the [[A*Teens]], among others. The avant-garde band [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] had also covered ''The Day Before You Came'' in the mid-1980s, one of the first bands to cover an ABBA track.

On [[April 6]]th 2004 three former ABBA members (Bj√∂rn, Benny and Frida) showed up together in London for the 30th anniversary of their Eurovision Song Contest win in 1974, appearing on stage after the fifth anniversary performance of ''Mamma Mia!''. In a November 2004 interview with the German magazine ''[[Bunte]]'' Bj√∂rn said a reunion would not satisfy ABBA's many fans, even though there are legions of them around the world often clamouring for one. In February 2005 all four members of ABBA appeared together in public for the first time since 1986 at the gala opening of ''Mamma Mia!'' in Stockholm.

On [[October 22]] 2005, during the celebration show for the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], ''Waterloo'' was [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm voted the best] Eurovision song in the history of the contest.

===Post-ABBA solo careers===

Both female members of ABBA have had some success with solo careers following the break-up of the band.

In [[1982]], Frida released her [[Phil Collins]]-produced album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' This album included the hit single &quot;I Know There's Something Going On&quot;. Agnetha followed in [[1983]] with the album ''Wrap Your Arms Around Me''. This album included the hit single ''The Heat Is On'' (a cover of the [[Noosha Fox]] recording) which was a big hit all over Europe and Scandinavia that year. In the US Agnetha scored a Billboard top 30 hit with ''Can't Shake Loose''. Her album sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide. Frida retired after her second solo album ''Shine'' flopped. Agnetha fared better with her second post-ABBA solo album ''Eyes of a Woman''. The album was number two in the Swedish charts and did reasonably well in Europe. 

After ''I Stand Alone'' in [[1987]] Agnetha withdrew from public life and refused to give interviews. In [[1996]] she released her [[autobiography]] called ''As I Am'' and also released a compilation that featured her solo hits. In [[2004]] she released a disc of cover songs called &quot;My Colouring Book&quot; which debuted at number one in Sweden and number six in Germany. The album peaked just outside of the British top ten (number 11) and the single ''If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind'' reached number 9 in the UK singles chart. The album went triple-platinum in Sweden (300,000 copies), gold in Finland and silver in Great Britain.

Frida released ''Shine'' (produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]) in [[1984 in music|1984]] but it was not until 1996 that she released her last album to date, the Swedish-language ''Djupa Andetag'' which was a number one album in Sweden (selling 90,000 copies) but unknown internationally. In September 2004 Frida recorded a song called &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot; with former [[Deep Purple]] member [[Jon Lord]] for his latest album, making some rare appearances on German television.

==Fashion and videos==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:abba2.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Members of ABBA embodied the height of disco glamour in the 70s.]] --&gt;
ABBA was widely noted as an epitome of 1970s fashion for the colourful costumes its members wore. The videos which accompanied some of their biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre. Though The Beatles and the Rolling Stones had shot the occasional video clip, making promotional videos still hadn't become the industry standard by the early-to-mid 1970s. Most of ABBA's videos (and ''ABBA - The Movie'') were directed by [[Lasse Hallstr√∂m]] who would later direct the films ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[Chocolat (movie)|Chocolat]]''. 

ABBA made videos because their songs were hits in so many different countries and personal appearances weren't always possible. This was also an effort to minimise travelling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Agnetha and Bj√∂rn had two young children, and Agnetha, who was also [[Fear of flying|afraid of flying]], was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager Stig Anderson realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicise a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one girl's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.
Nowadays, most of their videos can be seen on the DVDs ''ABBA Gold'' and ''The Definitive Collection''.

[[Image:Ringringstill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A still from ABBA's music video, or promo clip, &quot;Ring Ring.&quot;]]
Several ABBA videos were spoofed by others: The video &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; was satirised on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[comedy]] show ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' as &quot;Super Dooper.&quot;  The title ''[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]'' was also borrowed for a spoof chat show on BBC starring [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Alan Partridge]] who always entered the studio shouting &quot;Aha!&quot; (an exclamation in the lyrics). UK comedy duo [[French and Saunders]] parodied ABBA with their song &quot;C'est La Vie&quot;, an homage to &quot;The Winner Takes it All.&quot;  [[Erasure]] paid homage to the ABBA video style with their video for &quot;[[Take a Chance on Me]].&quot;

==Trivia==
*Songwriters Benny and Bj&amp;ouml;rn were unable to [[Musical_notation|notate music]] on paper. Only Agnetha could (as revealed in a [[Dick Cavett]] interview with the group).

*Abba have been spoofed by many TV shows, including ''[[French &amp; Saunders]]'', ''[[Not The Nine O'Clock News]]'' and ''[[Fast Forward]]''. In addition, the character of &quot;[[Alan Partridge]]&quot; is noted as being a huge ABBA fan, especially on his television show &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]&quot; where all the hosts and all guests were introduced with different ABBA songs.

*At the height of their success ABBA was Sweden's biggest export, exceeding even [[Volvo]] cars.

*While selling their music into Russia during the late 1970s ABBA were paid in oil commodities because of an [[embargo]] on the [[rouble]].

*The song ''Chiquitita'' was first performed at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] in [[1979]]. ABBA's performance at the concert was, however, [[lip-synching|lip-synched]]. All royalties from the song were donated to the children's charity [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] in perpetuity.

*In [[1981]], ABBA sponsored the [[ATS]] [[Formula One]] racing team, for whom [[Slim Borgudd]], a former drummer who appeared on some ABBA recordings, was a driver.

*The hit song &quot;Bring Me Edelweiss&quot; ([[1989]]) by [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] features the tune and some lyrics from &quot;S.O.S&quot;. This caused some controversy between Bjorn &amp; Benny, and manager Stig - Stig had granted approval to use the song without consulting the others.

*The sound track of the successful Australian film ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' ([[1994]]) prominently featured ABBA songs: The two female leads [[lip sync]] &quot;Waterloo&quot; and the wedding scene is scored to an orchestral rendition of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. The movie also features &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;Fernando&quot; and &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot;.

*Another 1994 Australian fillm ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' features a performance of ''Mamma Mia!'' by two [[drag queen|drag queens]], furthering ABBA's status as a [[gay icon]].

*The ABBA [[tribute band]] [[Bj&amp;ouml;rn Again]] became so successful that as of 2004 there were five casts of Bj&amp;ouml;rn Again performing in various parts of the world. The original Bj&amp;ouml;rn Again had been touring for 15 years, longer than the original group.

*[[techno music|Techno]] and [[house music|house]] remakes of many original ABBA hits were released under the name [[Abbacadabra]].

*''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' was nominated for a Broadway [[Tony Award]] as Best Musical in [[2002]].

*In [[2000]] ABBA were reported to have turned down an offer of approximately one billion dollars (US) to do a reunion tour.

*In 2005 ABBA's 1976 hit single &quot;Fernando&quot; still held the record for the most weeks spent at number one in Australia (along with The Beatles' &quot;Hey Jude&quot;). [http://www.onmc.iinet.net.au/top/1976.htm]

*In addition to being an [[acronym]], the name &quot;ABBA&quot; is also a [[palindrome]]. In 1975, ABBA's &quot;SOS&quot; became the first song with a palindromic title recorded by a group with a palindromic name to hit the pop charts.

*ABBA was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in [[2002]].

*In the film ''[[Johnny English]]'', the title character ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is discretely characterized as an ABBA fan. He sings &quot;Thank You for The Music&quot;, and lip-syncs to &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; in front of a mirror.

* [[The Fugees]] sampled [[ABBA]] (as well as [[Crystal Gayle]]) for their contribution to the [[1996]] &quot;[[When We Were Kings]]&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;

*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] sampled the group's &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot; in her [[2005]] single &quot;[[Hung Up]]&quot;.

'''Allegiance''' is the duty which a subject or a [[citizen]] owes to the [[state (law)|state]] or to the [[Monarch|sovereign]] of the state to which he belongs.

==Origin of the word==

Mid. English ''ligeaunce''; med. Latin ''ligeantia''; the al- was probably added through confusion with another legal term, ''allegeance'', an ''allegation''; the [[French language|French]] ''allegeance'' comes from the English; the word is formed from &quot;liege,&quot; of which the derivation is given under that heading; the connection with [[Latin]] ''ligare'', to bind, is erroneous.

==Usage==

The term ''allegiance'' is often used by English legal commentators in a larger sense, divided by them into natural and local, the latter applying to the deference which even a foreigner must pay to the institutions of the country in which he happens to live; but it is in its proper sense, in which it indicates national character and the subjection due to that character, that the word is important.

In that sense it represents the [[feudal]] [[liege homage]], which could be due only to one lord, while simple [[homage]] might be due to every lord under whom the person in question held land.

==United Kingdom==

The English doctrine, which was at one time adopted in the [[United States]], asserted that allegiance was indelible: &quot;Nemo potest exuere patriam&quot;. Accordingly, as the law stood before [[1870]], every person who by birth or [[naturalization]] satisfied the conditions set forth, though he should be removed in infancy to another country where his family resided, owed an allegiance to the British crown which he could never resign or lose, except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of British territory in which he resided.

Allegiance is the tie which binds the subject to the [[Sovereign]] in return for that protection which the Sovereign affords the subject. It was the mutual bond and obligation between the King or Queen and his or her subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their [[liege]] lord, because he should maintain and defend them (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525; ''China Navigation Co v Attorney-General'' (1932) 48 TLR 375; ''Attorney-General v Nissan'' [1969] 1 All ER 629; ''Oppenheimer v Cattermole'' [1972] 3 All ER 1106). The duty of the Crown towards its subjects is to govern and protect. The reciprocal duty of the subject towards the Crown is that of allegiance. 

At common law allegiance is a true and faithful obedience of the subject due to his Sovereign. As the subject owes to his king his true and faithful allegiance and obedience, so the Sovereign is to govern and protect his subjects, ''regere et protegere subdititos suos'', so as between the Sovereign and subject there is:

*''duplex et reciprocum ligamen; quia sicut subditus regi tenetur ad obedientiam, ita rex subdito tenetur ad protectionem; merito igitur ligeantia dicitur a ligando, quia continet in se duplex ligamen'' (''Calvin's Case'' (1608) 7 Co Rep 1a; Jenk 306; 2 State Tr 559; 77 ER 377). 

Natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as he or she is born they owe, by birthright, allegiance and obedience to their Sovereign (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever he or she may be. Where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)). 

Allegiance is owed both to the Sovereign as a natural person  and to the Sovereign in his or her political capacity (''Re Stepney Election Petition, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54 (per Lord Coleridge CJ)). Attachment to the person of the reigning Sovereign is not sufficient. Loyalty requires affection also to the office of the Sovereign, attachment to royalty, attachment to the law and to the constitution of the realm, and he who would, by force or by fraud, endeavour to prostrate that law and constitution, though he may retain his affection for its head, can boast but an imperfect and spurious species of loyalty (''R v O'Connell'' (1844) 7 ILR 261). 

There were four kinds of allegiances (''Rittson v Stordy'' (1855) 3 Sm &amp; G 230; ''De Geer v Stone'' (1882) 22 Ch D 243; ''Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 54 LT 684; ''Gibson, Gavin v Gibson'' [1913] 3 KB 379; ''Joyce v DPP'' [1946] AC 347; ''Collingwood v Pace'' (1661) O Bridg 410; ''Lane v Bennett'' (1836) 1 M &amp; W 70; ''Lyons Corp v East India Co'' (1836) 1 Moo PCC 175; ''Birtwhistle v Vardill'' (1840) 7 Cl &amp; Fin 895; ''R v Lopez, R v Sattler'' (1858) Dears &amp; B 525; Ex p Brown (1864) 5 B &amp; S 280); 

(a) ''Ligeantia naturalis, absoluta, pura et indefinita'', and this originally is due by nature and birthright, and is called ''alta ligeantia'', and those that owe this are called ''subditus natus''; 
(b) ''Ligeantia acquisita'', not by nature but by acquisition or denization, being called a denizen, or rather denizon, because he or she is ''subditus datus''; 

(c) ''Ligeantia localis'', by operation of law, when a friendly alien enters the country, because so long as he or she is in the country they are within the Sovereign's protection, therefore they owe the Sovereign a local obedience or allegiance (''R v Cowle'' (1759) 2 Burr 834; ''Low v Routledge'' (1865) 1 Ch App 42; ''Re Johnson, Roberts v Attorney-General'' [1903] 1 Ch 821; ''Tingley v Muller'' [1917] 2 Ch 144; ''Rodriguez v Speyer'' [1919] AC 59; ''Johnstone v Pedlar'' [1921] 2 AC 262; ''R v Tucker'' (1694) Show Parl Cas 186; ''R v Keyn'' (1876) 2 Ex  D 63; ''Re Stepney Election Petn, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54);

(d) A legal obedience, where a particular law requires the taking of an oath of allegiance by subject or alien alike.

Natural allegiance was acquired by birth within the Sovereign's dominions (except for the issue of diplomats or of invading forces or of an alien in enemy occupied territory). The natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as he or she is born they owe by birthright allegiance and obedience to the Sovereign (''Ex p. Anderson'' (1861) 3 E &amp; E 487). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever they may be, so that where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)). 

Acquired allegiance was acquired by naturalisation or denization. Denization, or ''ligeantia acquisita'', appears to be three-fold (''Thomas v Sorrel'' (1673) 3 Keb 143); 

*(a) absolute, as the common denization, without any limitation or restraint; 
*(b) limited, as when the Sovereign grants letters of denization to an alien, and to the heirs males of his or her body, or to an alien for term of his or her life; 
*(c) It may be granted upon condition, ''cujus est dare, ejus est disponere'', and this denization of an alien may come about three ways: by Parliament; by letters patent, which was the usual manner; and by conquest.

Local allegiance was due by an alien while in the protection of the Crown. All friendly resident aliens incurred all the obligations of subjects (''The Angelique'' (1801) 3 Ch Rob App 7). An alien, coming into a colony also became, temporarily a subject of the Crown, and acquired rights both within and beyond the colony, and these latter rights could not be affected by the laws of that colony (''Routledge v Low'' (1868) LR 3 HL 100; 37 LJ Ch 454; 18 LT 874; 16 WR 1081, HL; ''Reid v Maxwell'' (1886) 2 TLR 790; ''Falcon v Famous Players Film Co'' [1926] 2 KB 474). 

A resident alien owed allegiance even when the protection of the Crown was withdrawn owing to the occupation of an enemy, because the absence of the Crown's protection was temporary and involuntary (''de Jager v Attorney-Geneneral of Natal'' [1907] AC 326). 

Legal allegiance was due when an alien took an oath of allegiance required for a particular office under the Crown. 

By the [[Naturalization Act 1870]], it was made possible for British subjects to renounce their nationality and allegiance, and the ways in which that nationality is lost are defined. So British subjects voluntarily naturalized in a foreign state are deemed aliens from the time of such naturalization, unless, in the case of persons naturalized before the passing of the act, they have declared their desire to remain British subjects within two years from the passing of the act. Persons who from having been born within British territory are British subjects, but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are British subjects by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality. [[Emigration]] to an uncivilized country leaves British nationality unaffected: indeed the right claimed by all states to follow with their authority their subjects so emigrating is one of the usual and recognized means of [[colonial]] expansion.

==United States==

The doctrine that no man can cast off his native allegiance without the consent of his sovereign was early abandoned in the United States, and on [[July 27]], [[1868]], the day before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was adopted, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] declared in the preamble of the [[Expatriation Act]] that &quot;the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,&quot; and (Section I) one of &quot;the fundamental principles of this government&quot; ([[United States Revised Statutes]], sec. 1999). Every citizen of a foreign state in America owes a double allegiance, one to it and one to the United States. He may be guilty of treason against one or both. If the demands of these two sovereigns upon his duty of allegiance come into conflict, those of the United States have the paramount authority in American law.

==Oath of allegiance==
''Main article: [[oath of allegiance]]''

The oath of allegiance is an [[oath]] of fidelity to the sovereign taken by all persons holding important public office and as a condition of naturalization. By ancient common law it might be required of all persons above the age of twelve, and it was repeatedly used as a test for the disaffected. In [[England]] it was first imposed by statute in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]] ([[1558]]) and its form has more than once been altered since. Up to the time of the revolution the promise was, &quot;to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene [[honour]], and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defending him
therefrom.&quot; This was thought to favour the doctrine of absolute non-resistance, and accordingly the convention parliament enacted the form that has been in use since that time - &quot;I do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty ...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Absolute majority''' is a [[supermajority|supermajoritarian]] [[voting]] requirement which is stricter than a [[simple majority]]. It means that more than half of ''all'' the members of a group, including those absent and those present but not voting, must [[vote]] in favour of a proposition in order for that proposition to be passed.

As an example, let's say that a member of a club of 100 members proposes a new [[bylaw]]. According to the club's practice, for the bylaw to pass, it requires an absolute majority.  The results of the vote are 40 yes votes and 30 no votes.  The rest of the voters either abstained or did not vote.  Even though this arrangement is a [[simple majority]], since an absolute majority for the club is 51 members, the proposed bylaw fails.

Absolute majority voting is most often used to pass changes to constitutions or to [[bylaw]]s in order to ensure that there is affirmative support for a proposal. Most voting decisions require a [[simple majority]] or even just a [[plurality]].

==Examples of absolute majority voting==
From 2005, an absolute majority of the electorate in addition to a three-fourths vote of the [[legislature]] is necessary to pass amendments to the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]] as well as to ratify a [[referendum]]. The requirement of an absolute majority rather than a simple majority effectively gives both major political blocs the power to veto a referendum or constitutional amendment.

In the [[politics of the European Union]], any decision taken using the [[codecision procedure]] requires an absolute majority in [[European Parliament]] in order to amend a text in its second reading. (At first reading, only a [[simple majority]] is required.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adventure International''' was a [[Computer and video games|video game]] publishing company that existed from 1978 until 1985, started by Scott and Alexis Adams. Their games were notable for being the first implementation of the adventure genre to run on a microcomputer system. The adventure game concept originally came from [[Colossal Cave Adventure]] which ran strictly on large mainframe systems at the time.

After the success of their first game &quot;Adventureland&quot;, games followed rapidly, with Adventure International (or &quot;AI&quot;) releasing about two games a year. Initially the games were drawn from the founders imagination, with themes ranging from [[fantasy]] to [[Horror fiction|horror]] and sometimes [[science fiction]]. Some of the later games were written by Scott Adams and other collaborators. Adventure Internationals' games became known for quality, with a reputation only exceeded in the field at the time by [[Infocom]].

Fourteen games later, Adventure International began to release games drawn from film and fiction. The extremely rare Buckaroo Banzai game, developed with Phillip Case, was based on the film [[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension]] ([[1984]]). Other games came from a more well known source: [[Marvel Comics]]. Adventure International released three games based on the Marvel characters: &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Torch and the Thing&quot;. 

By the end of [[1982]], game tastes were changing. The traditional text-based [[adventure game]] market had moved to graphical based adventures.  Games like [[The Hobbit (video game)|The Hobbit]] had increased expectations of such games, and although Adventure International games included graphics of a sort, they were significantly inferior to contemporary offerings at the time and the company was rapidly losing [[market share]].

Adventure International went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in [[1985]]. The [[copyright]]s for its games reverted to the bank and eventually back to Scott Adams who released them as [[shareware]].  At its peak in late 1983 to early 1984 Adventure International employed approximately 50 individuals, and published titles from over 300 independent programmer/authors.

In [[Europe]] the &quot;Adventure International&quot; name was a trading name of [[AdventureSoft]] and other games were released under the name that were not from Adventure International in the [[United States|USA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Arthur C. Clarke.jpg|thumb|200px|Arthur C. Clarke]]

'''Sir Arthur Charles Clarke''' (born [[December 16]] [[1917]]) is the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]] and [[inventor]], most famous for his [[science-fiction]] novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and for collaborating with director [[Stanley Kubrick]] on the film of the same name.  Clarke is considered one of the Big Three of science fiction, along with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Isaac Asimov]]; he is the only one still alive. 

==''2001: A Space Odyssey''== was written concurrently with the [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film version]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. It was loosely inspired by Clarke's short story &quot;[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]&quot;, but became its own novel while he was collaborating on a screenplay with Kubrick.  Kubrick approached Clarke about writing a novel for the express purpose of making &quot;the proverbial good science-fiction movie&quot;, and the novel was still being written while the film was being made.  This resulted in one of the truly unique collaborations in media history.

Clarke has written numerous other books, including the [[Rendezvous with Rama|Rama]] novels and several sequels to ''2001'', and many short stories, including &quot;[[The Star]]&quot;, about a Jesuit priest's spiritual dilemma.

An [[asteroid]] is named in Clarke's honour, [[4923 Clarke]], as is a species of [[Ceratopsian]] [[dinosaur]], ''[[Serendipaceratops arthurcclarkei]]'', discovered in [[Inverloch, Victoria|Inverloch]] in [[Australia]]. The [[2001 Mars Odyssey]] orbiter is named in honor of Sir Arthur's works.

In the [[1940s]] he forecast that man would reach the [[Moon landing|moon]] by the year [[2000]], an idea experts dismissed as rubbish. When [[Neil Armstrong]] landed in [[1969]], the United States said Clarke &quot;provided the essential intellectual drive that led us to the moon.&quot; ([http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticleSearch.aspx?storyID=221763+14-Nov-2005+RTRS&amp;srch=clarke] [http://www.taborcommunications.com/archives/3047.html])

He lives in [[Sri Lanka]], and survived the [[tsunami]]s of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], but lost his diving school on [[Hikkaduwa]] ([http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=13638567] [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/12/30/latest/20462ArthurC&amp;sec=latest]). Clarke holds citizenship of both the [[UK]] and [[Sri Lanka]] [http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2005/12/11/new27.html].

==Biography==
Clarke was born in [[Minehead]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]], and as a boy enjoyed stargazing and enthusiastically read old American science-fiction magazines (many of which made their way to England as ballast in ships).  After secondary school, and studying at [[Richard Huish College, Taunton]] he was unable to afford a university education and consequently acquired a job as an auditor in the pensions section of the Board of Education.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a [[radar]] specialist and was involved in the early warning radar defense system which contributed to the RAF's success during the [[Battle of Britain]].  He retired in the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]].  After the war, he obtained a first class [[academic degree|degree]] in mathematics and physics at [[King's College London]].

His most important contribution may be the idea that [[geostationary satellite]]s would be ideal [[telecommunication]]s relays. He proposed this concept in a paper titled &quot;[http://www.lsi.usp.br/~rbianchi/clarke/ACC.ETRelaysFull.html Extra-Terrestrial Relays] - Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?&quot;, published in ''[[Wireless World]]'' in October [[1945]]. The [[geostationary orbit]] is now sometimes known as the Clarke orbit in his honour.  However, it is not clear that his article was actually the inspiration for modern telecommunications satellites.  [[John R. Pierce]], of [[Bell Labs]], arrived at the idea independently in 1954, and he was actually involved in the [[Echo satellite]] and [[Telstar]] projects. However, Pierce stated that the idea was &quot;in the air&quot; at the time and certain to be developed regardless of Clarke's publication.

Clarke's first professional sale was in [[1946]] to ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', the still memorable short story &quot;Rescue Party&quot;.  Along with his writing, Clarke worked briefly as Assistant Editor of ''[[Science Abstracts]]'' ([[1949]]) before devoting himself to writing full-time from 1951. Clarke also contributed to the ''[[Dan Dare]]'' series and his first three published novels were for a juvenile audience.  He has been chairman of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] and a member of the [[Underwater Explorers Club]]. His work is marked by its optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the solar system and an obvious influence was the work of [[Olaf Stapledon]]. 

In [[1951]], he wrote &quot;The Sentinel&quot; for a [[BBC]] competition. Though the story was rejected, it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only the basis for ''2001'', ''The Sentinel'' introduced a more mystical and cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of ''[[The City and the Stars]]'', ''[[Childhood's End]]'', and the ''2001'' series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution.

He has lived in [[Sri Lanka]] since [[1956]], immigrating when it was still called [[Ceylon]], first in [[Unawatuna]] on the south coast, and then in [[Colombo]]. This inspired the locale for his novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'', in which he describes a [[space elevator]]. This, he figures, will ultimately be his legacy, more so than [[geostationary satellite]]s, once space elevators make space shuttles obsolete.

Early in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the [[paranormal]], and has stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel ''Childhood's End''. He has also said that he was one of several who were fooled by a [[Uri Geller]] demonstration at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. Although he has long since dismissed and distanced himself from nearly all [[pseudoscience]], he still advocates for research into purported instances of [[psychokinesis]] and other similar phenomena.

Following the release of ''2001'', Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the [[Apollo space program]]. He also signed a three-book publishing deal, a record  for a science fiction writer. The first of the three was ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' in [[1973]], which won him all the main genre awards and has spawned sequels that, along with the ''2001'' series, formed the backbone of Clarke's later career.

In [[1975]], his short story ''The Star'' was not included as prose in a new high school [[English Language|English]] textbook in [[Sri Lanka]], because it was felt that it might offend [[Roman Catholics]], although it had been selected. The textbook caused controversy because it replaced [[Shakespeare]]'s work with that of [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Isaac Asimov]].

Clarke is also well known to many for his television programmes ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'' ([[1981]]) and ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' ([[1984]]).

In [[1986]], Clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money (initially ¬£1,000) for the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] for the best science fiction novel published in Britain in the previous year. In [[2001]] the prize was increased to ¬£2001, and its value now matches the year (i.e., ¬£2005 in [[2005]]).

In [[1988]], he was diagnosed with [[post-polio syndrome]] and has since needed to use a wheelchair.

His [[British honours system|knighthood]] was first announced in [[1998]], but then the British [[tabloid]] ''[[The Daily Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]'' published accusations of [[pedophilia|paedophilia]] against him ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/52598.stm]). The award was delayed while the allegations were investigated, although by [[2000]] the BBC reported that he had been cleared ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/765385.stm]). Clarke's health did not allow him to travel to [[London]] to receive the honour personally from the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], so the UK [[High Commissioner]] to [[Sri Lanka]] awarded him the title of [[Knight Bachelor]] at a ceremony in [[Colombo]].

He is currently the Honorary Board Chair of the [[Institute for Cooperation in Space]], founded by [[Carol Rosin]] and on the [[Board of Governors]] of the [[National Space Society]], a [[space advocacy]] organization originally founded by Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]].

He was the first Chancellor of the [[International Space University]], serving from [[1989]] to [[2004]] and Chancellor of [[Moratuwa University]], [[Sri Lanka]], from [[1979]] to [[2002]].

In [[2005]] he lent his name to the first ever annual [http://www.clarkeawards.org Sir Arthur Clarke Awards] - dubbed &quot;the Oscars for Space&quot;.  His brother attended the awards ceremony, and presented an award specially chosen by Arthur (and not by the panel of judges who chose the other awards).

On [[14 November]] [[2005]] Sri Lanka awarded Arthur C. Clarke its highest civilian award, the Lankabhimanaya ''(Pride of Lanka)'' award, for his contributions to science and technology and his commitment to his adopted country.

==Themes, style, and influence==
Clarke's early published stories would usually feature the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough that assists the resolution of a human dilemma. The first manned mission to the moon (''[[Prelude to Space]]''), the colonization of [[Mars]] (''[[The Sands of Mars]]'') and life aboard a space station (''[[Islands in the Sky]]'') were all genre SF mainstays. Clarke's background as a technical writer showed in the early novels as a deliberate documentary style, and his characters reflect Clarke's experience by being mostly  military or civil service types. Despite this, Clarke's style was open to humour and a degree of whimsy which salted its propagandist tone regarding scientific advancement with a sting in the tail.

A recurring type of character is found in ''[[The Lion of Comarre]]'', ''[[The City and the Stars]]'', ''[[The Road to the Sea]]'', and other works. A young man in a superficially [[utopian]] society becomes dissatisfied and restless and seeks to expand his horizons, thereby discovering the underlying decadence of his own society.

''The Sentinel'' introduced a religious theme to Clarke's work. His interest in the paranormal was influenced by [[Charles Fort]] and embraced the belief that mankind may be the property of an ancient alien civilization. Surprisingly for a writer who is often held up as an example of hard science fiction's obsession with technology, three of Clarke's novels have this as a theme.

==The adapted screenplays of Arthur C. Clarke==
===''2001: A Space Odyssey''===  
Clarke's first venture into film was the Stanley Kubrick-directed ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Kubrick and Clarke had met in [[1964]] to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, it was decided that the story for the film was to be loosely based on Clarke's short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, written in [[1948]] as an entry in a BBC short story competition.  Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but this proved to be more tedious than he had estimated. Instead, Kubrick and Clarke decided it would be best to write a novel first and then adapt it for the film upon its completion. However, as Clarke was finishing the book, the screenplay was also being written simultaneously.

Due to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of [[1964]] with the plan to publish the novel in [[1965]] in advance of the film's release in [[1966]]. After many delays the film was released in the spring of [[1968]], before the book was completed. It was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelisation, that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay his authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film is a bold artistic piece with little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of &quot;cause and effect&quot; for the events in the novel. Despite their differences, both film and novel were well received. [http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=2001.htm] [http://movies.go.com/moviesdynamic/movies/movie?id=479433] [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Ddvd%2526field-keywords%3Dspace%2520odyssey%2526results-process%3Ddefault%2526dispatch%3Dsearch/ref%3Dpd%5Fsl%5Fov%5Ftops-1%5Fdvd%5F4138659%5F1/104-5000595-8600727]

In [[1972]] Clarke published ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', which included his account of the production and alternate versions of key scenes. The &quot;special edition&quot; of the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)| A Space Odyssey]]'' (released in [[1999]]) contains an introduction by Clarke, documenting his account of the events leading to the release of the novel and film.

===''2010: The Year We Make Contact''===  
In [[1982]] Clarke continued the ''2001'' epic with a sequel, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. This novel was also made into a film, ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'', directed by [[Peter Hyams]] for release in [[1984]]. Due to the political environment in America in the 1980s, the novel and film present a Cold War theme, with the looming tensions of nuclear war. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as ''2001'', but the reviews were still positive and it has earned over 40 million dollars since its release in North America. [http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=2010.htm]

Clarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984. Titled ''[[The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010]]'', and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film. The book also includes [[Arthur C Clarke's List of the best Science-Fiction films of all time|Clarke's list of the best science-fiction films]] ever made.

===''Rendezvous with Rama''===  
Early in the millennium, actor [[Morgan Freeman]] expressed his desire to produce a film based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel ''Rendezvous with Rama''. The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, [[Revelations Entertainment]].[http://www.revelationsent.com/flash/index.html] Freeman has not given up on the project, but he states that funding for a movie of this type is hard to procure. A popular science-fiction web site (Sci Fi Wire) posted an interview with Freeman about his troubles with the production. [http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2003-03/14/12.00.film]

==Essays and short stories==
Most of Clarke's essays (between [[1934]] to [[1998]]) can be found in the book ''[[Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!]]'' ([[2000]]). Most of his short stories can be found in the book ''[[The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke]]'' ([[2001]]). They make a good collection of Clarke's non-fiction and fiction works, even for those who already have most of his books. Another collection of early essays was published in ''[[The View from Serendip]]'' ([[1977]]), which also included one short piece of fiction, &quot;[[When the Twerms Came]]&quot;. He has also written short stories under the pseudonyms of [[E. G. O'Brien]] and [[Charles Willis]].

[[Image:Mp2k.gif|right|thumb|The Apple Newton MessagePad 2100, the last model produced.]]

The '''Apple Newton''', or simply '''Newton''', was an early line of [[personal digital assistant]]s developed, manufactured and marketed by [[Apple Computer]] from [[1993]] to [[1998]]. The original Newtons were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor, and featured [[handwriting recognition]]. Apple's official name for the device was ''MessagePad''; the term ''Newton'' was Apple's name for the operating system it used, but popular usage of the word ''Newton'' has grown to include the device and its software together.

== The Newton in development ==

The Newton project was not originally intended to produce a PDA.  The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the &quot;[[personal digital assistant]]&quot; moniker itself was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's then-CEO [[John Sculley]], the driving force behind the project. Newton was, in fact, intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing.  For most of its design lifecycle Newton had a large-format screen, more internal memory, and a rich object-oriented graphics kernel. One of the original motivating scenarios for the design was known as the &quot;Architect Scenario,&quot; in which Newton's designers imagined a residential architect working quickly with a client to sketch, clean up, and interactively modify a simple two-dimensional home plan.

For a portion of the Newton's development cycle (roughly the middle third &lt;!--exact dates?--&gt;), the project's primary programming language was [[Dylan programming language|Dylan]], a small, efficient [[object-oriented]] [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] variant that still retains some interest. Although it was efficient (for its day, and considering its substantial run-time [[dynamic programming language|dynamism]]), Dylan was a tough sell for the large-format Newton (and for a development team unused to Lisp programming). With the move to the smaller form factor, Dylan was relegated to experimental status in the &quot;Bauhaus Project&quot; and eventually cancelled outright.  Had it been retained, Dylan, with [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] and close OS integration, would have preceded Microsoft's [[managed code]] revolution by over a decade.

The project missed by far its original goals to reinvent personal computing, and then to rewrite contemporary application programming. The Newton project's broad vision fell victim to project slippage, [[feature creep]], and a growing fear that it would interfere with Macintosh sales. It was reinvented as a PDA which would be a complementary Macintosh peripheral instead of a stand-alone computer which might compete with the Macintosh.

== Technical details ==

Newton used an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] system called [[NewtonScript]], developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]] [http://waltersmith.us/]. One of the major complaints programmers had was that the Toolbox programming environment was overpriced at $1000 (later in the life of the Newton, the programming environment was made available free of charge).  Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming.  Despite this, many third party and [[shareware]] applications were (and continue to be) available for Newton.  It has been suggested that the NewtonScript programming system should be made available open-source (as &quot;[[abandonware]]&quot;) but most Newton enthusiasts consider this possibility to be highly unlikely. 

Data in Newton was stored in object-oriented databases known as ''soups.'' One of the revolutionary aspects of Newton was that soups were available to all programs; and programs could operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar could refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad could be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups could be programmer-extended - a new address book enhancement could be built on the data from the existing address book.

While the soup concept worked remarkably well within the Newton system itself, it caused several usability issues.  First, it made it extremely difficult to synchronize data with other systems, like a desktop [[Macintosh]] or [[Personal computer|PC]], making the Newton a [[data island]].  Apple's utility to perform this task, the Newton Connection Utility, was exceedingly complex and was never completed to perform to the satisfaction of most users.  The realization that a handheld computer needed to work within the existing data environment of its users was key to the success of the later [[Palm Pilot]] platform, even though the Palm was technically inferior.

The second consequence of the data-object soup was that objects could extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users could not distinguish which program or add-on object was responsible for the various features on their own system.  A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing.  Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves were tossed in the &quot;Storage&quot; area of the &quot;Extras&quot; drawer.  There was no built-in distinction between types of data in that area.  For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.  There was no easy way to get a listing of all user-installed objects on a system.

Finally, the data soup concept worked well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it worked poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents.  This difficulty in working and sharing data with other systems, stemming from the too revolutionary data-object soup system, was a key contributor to Newton's demise.

Earlier MessagePads used [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]-standard [[serial port]]s - round [[DIN connector|Mini-DIN 8 connector]]s instead of the more common trapezoidal [[D-subminiature|DE-9, commonly called DB-9]]. The 2000/2100 models had a proprietary small flat connector, called an InterConnect port, used with an adapter. In addition, all models had [[infrared]] connectivity.  Unlike the Palm, all MessagePad models were equipped with a standard [[PCMCIA]] expansion slot (two on the 2000/2100).  This allowed native modem and even [[Ethernet]] connectivity; Newton users have also written [[Device_driver|drivers]] for [[802.11b]] wireless networking cards and ATA-type [[flash memory]] cards, a category that includes the popular [[CompactFlash]] format, as well as for [[Bluetooth]] cards. With the 1xx series, an optional keyboard became available, which could also be used via the dongle on a 2x00. Newton could also dial a phone number through the MessagePad speaker, simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker, and fax / email support was built in at the operating system level, although it required external cards. 

The MessagePad 2000 and 2100, with a vastly improved handwriting recognition system, 162MHz [[StrongARM]]SA-110 [[RISC]] processor, Newton 2.1, and a better, clearer, backlit screen, attracted critical plaudits. Although their size and expense were factors which kept them from being as popular as later [[PalmOS]] devices, the Newton still has a small but passionate user base. The final evolution of the Newton's handwriting recognition system is still considered by many to be very impressive, only matched by the more modern [[Tablet PC]] handwriting recognition system.

The MessagePad could be used with the screen turned horizontally (&quot;landscape&quot;) as well as vertically (&quot;portrait&quot;). A change of a setting would instantly rotate the contents of the display by ninety degrees. Handwriting recognition would still work properly with the display rotated.

The use of 4x [[AA]] [[NiCd]] (MessagePad 110, 120 and 130) and 4x AA [[NiMH]] cells (2x00 series, eMate 300) gave a runtime of up to 30 hours (MP 2100 w/ 2x 20 MB linear [[Flash memory]] [[PC Card]]s, no backlight usage) and up to 24 hours with backlight on. While adding more weight to the Newtons than [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]] (as used in the MessagePad and MessagePad 100) or custom battery packs, the choice of an easily replaceable/rechargeable cell format gave the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply. This, together with the [[Flash memory]] used as internal storage (if all cells lost their power, no data was lost due to the static character of this storage), gave birth to the slogan &quot;Newton never dies, it only gets new batteries&quot;.

Apple and third parties marketed several &quot;wallets&quot; (cases) for the MessagePads, which would hold them securely along with the owner's credit cards, driver's license, business cards, and cash. These wallets were even larger than the MessagePads and even less able to fit in a pocket, so they were most often used as a protective case for the unit to shield it from bumps and scratches.

== Outcome ==

Although the Apple Newton was produced for six years, it was never as successful in the marketplace as Apple had hoped. This has been attributed to two primary reasons: the Newton's high price (which went up to $1000 when models 2000 and 2100 were introduced), and its large size (it failed the &quot;pocket test&quot; by not fitting in an average coat, shirt, or trouser pocket). Critics also panned its [[handwriting recognition]].  These initial problems marred Newton's reputation in the eyes of the public, and PDAs would remain a niche product until [[Palm, Inc.]]'s [[Palm Pilot]], which emerged shortly before the Newton was discontinued.  The Palm Pilot, with its smaller, thinner shape, cheaper cost, and more robust [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] handwriting recognition system - which had been available first as a software package for the Newton - managed to restore the viability of the PDA market after Newton's commercial failure. Ironically, Palm Computing was founded by ex-Apple employee [[Donna Dubinsky]].

The Newton marketing campaign trumpeted the product's handwriting recognition, though in initial versions it was fairly inaccurate. The original handwriting recognition engine was called Calligrapher, and was licensed from a Russian company called Paragraph International. It was actually quite sophisticated; unlike the later Palm Pilot's Graffiti - which made the user learn a new handwriting system and write each letter in an input area - Newton learned the user's natural handwriting, using a database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing, and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen. Newton could also recognize and clean up simple drawn shapes such as triangles, circles, and squares, and had an intuitive system for handwritten editing, such as scratching out words to be deleted, circling text to be selected, or using written carets to mark inserts. 

Later releases of the Newton operating system retained the original recognizer for compatibility, but added a printed-text recognizer, code-named &quot;[[Rosetta (Newton)|Rosetta]],&quot; which was developed by Apple, included in version 2.0 of the Newton operating system, and refined in Newton 2.1. Rosetta was generally considered a significant improvement and many users consider the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives since.  Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as &quot;1 + 2 =&quot; was also under development but never released. 

The most critical feature of the Newton handwriting recognition system was the modeless error correction. That is, correction done in situation without using a separate window or widget, using a minimum of gestures.  If a word was recognized improperly, the user would simply  double-tap the word and a list of alternatives would pop up in a menu under the stylus.  Most of the time, the correct word would be in the list. If not, a button at the bottom of the list allowed the user to edit individual characters in that word.  Error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process, greatly increasing the interruption to a user's workflow that a given correction requires. Excellent handwriting recognition (in OS 2.1 and higher) with smooth, modeless access to robust error correction is quite possibly a leading reason for the continued popularity of the device among Newton users.  

Even given the age of the hardware and software, Newtons still demand a sale price on the used market far greater than that of PDAs produced by other companies.  [[As of 2004]] the Newton 2000 and 2100 can still fetch a price, without accessories, of over $100.

==Later efforts==

Many prototypes of additional Newton models were spotted. Most notable was a Newton tablet or &quot;slate,&quot; a large, flat screen that could be written on. Others included a &quot;Kids Newton&quot; with side handgrips and buttons, &quot;VideoPads&quot; which would have incorporated a video camera and screen on their flip-top covers for two-way communications, the &quot;Mini 2000&quot; which would have been very similar to Palm Pilot, and the &quot;NewtonPhone&quot; (developed by [[Siemens AG]]) which incorporated a handset and a keyboard.

At least one product, the [[eMate 300]] was derived from the Apple Newton, and was offered to schools in 1997 as an inexpensive ($799 US, originally sold to education markets only) and durable computer for classroom use.  However, in order to achieve its low price, the eMate 300 did not have all the features of the contemporary Newton equivalent, the MessagePad 2000 and was cancelled along with the rest of the Newton line.

Before the Newton project was cancelled, it was &quot;spun off&quot; into its own company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when [[Steve Jobs]] ousted Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] and resumed control of Apple. There has since been continual speculation that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm. Apple continues to deny that such a project will ever happen.

The Apple [[Apple iPod | iPod]] is somewhat of a descendant of the Newton in that it is a pocket-sized programmable device based on the ARM processor. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]], the company that created the iPod's OS.

Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the &quot;Print Recognizer&quot; part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into [[Mac OS X]] version 10.2 (known as &quot;Jaguar&quot;). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as &quot;[[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]]&quot;, appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. Whether Apple will ever utilize such technology again in a [[handheld device]] remains to be seen.

In June 2004, Apple CEO Steve Jobs indicated that he was proud that Apple resisted pressure to market a new handheld computer. While a small group of Mac faithful consumers have lobbied Apple to sell such a device, the worldwide market for PDAs was in a decline at the time, and Apple chose not to develop the device because demand would have been inadequate.

The NewtonOS was also licensed to a number of third party developers including Sharp and Motorola who developed additional PDA devices that used the operating system.  Motorola added added wireless connectivity to the unit, and renamed it the Marco[http://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/marco.htm].
A possible Newton revival has been a common source of speculation among the Macintosh user base; when patents for a tablet based Macintosh were applied for (http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=600), rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new [[Tablet PC]] style Macintosh.

==Appearances in popular culture==

* The Newton was featured in the movie ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory|Under Siege 2]],'' where the main character, played by [[Steven Seagal]], uses it to fax a call for help from a phone on a passenger train.
* In early episodes of the series ''[[The X-Files]]'', the FBI agents use Newtons.
* In the end scene of Larry Laffer ''Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!'' the woman says &quot;I even had a Newton&quot;.
* The character of Kate Libby in ''[[Hackers (movie)|Hackers]]'' has a MessagePad which is seen in a number of scenes.
* The hacker in the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' has a Newton on his desk.
* [[Gary Sinise]] uses one as the hostage taker in the 1996 film ''Ransom'' starring [[Mel Gibson]].
* Daniel Br√ºhl uses one in the German film ''[[The Edukators]]''.

The handwriting recognition software was ridiculed on several occasions:
* [[Garry Trudeau]] ridiculed it in a series of episodes of his popular comic, ''[[Doonesbury]]''. The last panel of one strip, which shows a character reading the words &quot;egg freckles?&quot; from his Newton [http://images.ucomics.com/comics/db/1993/db930827.gif], became an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in the Newton operating system itself (version 2.0 and earlier). It can be seen by writing the words ''egg freckles'' then highlighting them and tapping the Assist button.
* In an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled &quot;[[Lisa on Ice]]&quot;, which first aired [[November 13]], [[1994]], school bully Kearny has his buddy Daulph take a memo on a Newton.  When Daulph writes &quot;Beat up Martin&quot; on the screen, the handwriting recognition turns it into &quot;Eat up Martha.&quot; Kearny throws the Newton at [[Martin Prince|Martin]] instead. [http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F05.html]
* In 2004, [[CNET]] elected the Apple Newton one of the &quot;Top 10 tech we miss&quot; [http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6259955.html], mentioning the device's amusing willingness to translate nearly any stroke on the screen to text, allowing the user to generate surreal ''Newton Poetry'' from random scribbles.

==Other Uses==
There were a number of projects that used the Newton as a portable information device in cultural settings such as museums. For example, Visible Interactive created a walking tour in San Francisco's Chinatown but the most significant effort took place in Malaysia at the Petronas Discovery Center, known as Petrosains.[http://www.petrosains.com.my/]

In 1995, an exhibit design firm, DMCD Inc. [http://www.dmcd.com]was awarded the contract to design a new 100,000 square foot science museum in the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur. A major factor in the award was the concept that visitors would use a Newton to access additional information, find out where they were in the museum, listen to audio, see animations, control robots and other media, and to bookmark information for printout at the end of the exhibit.

The device became known as the ARIF, a Malay word for &quot;wise man&quot; or &quot;seer&quot; and it was also an acronym for A Resourceful Informative Friend. Some 400 ARIFS were installed and over 250 are still in use today.

The development of the ARIF system was extremely complex and required a team of hardware and software engineers, designers, and writers. The exhibition design and ARIF coordination team was led by Scott Guerin, the hardware/software team by Ted Paschkis, and the writers and interface designers included Paul Trapido and Michael Callan. Mssrs. Guerin and Paschkis went on to found Wivid Systems which specializes in multimedia tour guides for museums. [http://www.wivid.com]

ARIF is an ancestor of the PDA systems used in museums today and it boasted features that have not been attempted since. For example it was used as an exploration tool in a large exhibit about exploring for oil. A visitor's success completing one task influenced the success or failure of a subsequent task. At the conclusion of the exhibit, the ARIF was docked at an IR port where it was used to control a robotic arm that placed equipment at locations influenced by the users previous lessons. In another exhibit, up to eight devices could be used at to activate a 60 foot diameter model of prehistoric Malaysia; volcano eruptions, animal sounds, lighting effects, and wind are among the many effects. This task was accomplished by docking the ARIF at a computer terminal and using it as the input device. There are no touch screens in Petrosains, all interactive systems were controlled by the ARIF.

The Newton was &quot;married&quot; to a primitive packet switching radio system in order to determine its location as the visitor passed through electronic &quot;gateways.&quot; When the visitor entered a new room, the radio triggered an automatic area introduction. The radio also delivered time-synch'd audio in two languages to a group of users when they watched a video.

In addition to being dual language in all audio and text, the ARIF stored bookmarked information such that at the end of the exhibit, users could choose several items of most interest to be printed out, including a souvenir photograph of themselves superimposed on one of several stage sets.

==Jokes==
* A popular [[lightbulb joke]] circled the internet briefly, ostensibly from the [[newsgroup]] comp.sys.newton.misc. 
*: Q: How many Newtons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
*: A: Foux!  There to eat lemons, axe gravy soup.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfred Elton van Vogt''' ([[Winnipeg]], [[Canada]], [[April 26]], [[1912]] - [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|USA]], [[January 26]], [[2000]]) was a renowned [[Canada|Canadian]]-born [[science fiction author]] widely regarded as one of the most prolific, yet complex, writers from the mid-twentieth century '[[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]]' of the genre.

==Science Fiction's Golden Age==

Van Vogt was one of the most popular and highly esteemed science fiction writers of the [[1940s]], during the ascent of the genre's Golden Age. After starting his writing career by writing for 'true confession' style [[pulp magazines]] like ''True Story'', van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed, [[science fiction]].

Van Vogt's first published SF story, &quot;Black Destroyer&quot; (''[[Analog Science Fiction|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', [[July]] [[1939]]), was inspired by ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]]. The story depicted a fierce, carnivorous [[Extraterrestrial_life|alien]] stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. It was the cover story of the issue of ''Astounding'' which ushered in the Golden Age of science fiction. The story became an instant classic and eventually served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies. In 1950 it was combined with &quot;War of Nerves&quot; ([[1950]]), &quot;Discord in Scarlet&quot; (1939) and &quot;M33 in Andromeda&quot; ([[1943]]) to form the novel ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' ([[1950]])

Many fans of that era would have named van Vogt, [[Robert A. Heinlein]], and [[Isaac Asimov]] as the three greatest science fiction writers.

In [[1941]] van Vogt decided to become a full time writer, quitting his job at the Canadian Department of National Defence.  Extremely prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote a large number of [[short stories]]. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or &quot;[[fixup|fixups]]&quot; as he called them, a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction criticism. Sometimes this was successful (''[[The War against the Rull]]'') while other times the disparate stories thrown together made for a less coherent plot (''[[Quest for the Future]]'').

One of van Vogt's best novels of this period is ''[[Slan]]'', which appeared in ''Astounding Sicence Fiction'' in [[1940]]. Using what became one of van Vogt's recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old [[superman]] living in a world in which his kind are slain by [[Homo sapiens]].

==A post-war philosopher== 

In [[1944]], van Vogt moved to [[Hollywood, California]], where his writing took on new dimensions after [[World War II]].  Van Vogt was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern [[meta-systems]]), the characters in his very first story used a system called 'Nexialism' to analyze the alien's behaviour, and he became interested in the [[General Semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]].  And he was profoundly affected by revelations of [[totalitarian]] [[police state|police states]] that emerged after [[World War II]].  He wrote a mainstream novel that was set in Communist [[China]], ''The Angry Man'' ([[1962]]); he said that prior to this he had read 100 books about China.

He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' and ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]'' in the late [[1940s]], and ''[[Null-A Three]]'' in the early [[1980s]].  ''Null-A'', or [[non-Aristotelian logic]], refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using [[intuitive]], inductive reasoning ([[fuzzy logic]]), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, deductive logic.

[[Image:Linn.jpg|thumb|220px|First edition of ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]'' ([[1956]])]]

Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved.  Several of his stories hinge upon temporal [[Conundrum|conundrums]], a favorite theme.  He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from books on writing by [[Thomas Uzzell]].

He said many of his ideas came from dreams, and indeed his stories at times had the incoherence of dreams, but at their best, as in the fantasy novel ''[[The Book of Ptath]]'', his works had all the vision and power a dream can impart.  Throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90 minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams.

In the [[1950s]], van Vogt briefly became involved in [[L. Ron Hubbard|L. Ron Hubbard's]] [[Dianetics]].  Van Vogt operated a storefront, for the secular precursor to Hubbard's [[Scientology]] [[sect]], in the [[Los Angeles]] area for a time, before winding up at odds with Hubbard and his methods.  His writing more or less stopped for some years, a period in which he bitterly claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by Hubbard's followers.  In this period he limited to collect old short stories to form notable [[fixup|fixups]] like: ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' ([[1952]]), ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' ([[1959]]), ''[[The Beast]]'' ([[1963]]) and the two novels of the &quot;Linn&quot; cyle, which were inspired by fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. He resumed writing again in the [[1960s]], mainly through [[Frederik Pohl]]'s invitation, while remaining in Hollywood with his second wife, Lydia Bereginsky, who took care of him through his declining years. In this period his stories were born since the very beginning as whole novels, but in general show van Vogt's difficulties in keeping pace with the evolution of science fiction.

==Recognition==

In [[1946]], van Vogt and his first wife, [[Edna Mayne Hull]], were co-Guests of Honor at the fourth [[World Science Fiction Convention]], 

In [[1980]], van Vogt received a &quot;Casper Award&quot; (precursor to the Canadian [[Aurora Award]]s) for Lifetime Achievement. In [[1995]] he was awarded the [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award]].  In [[1996]], van Vogt was recognized on two occasions: the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] presented him with a Special Award ''for six decades of golden age science fiction'', and the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] included him among its initial four inductees.

===Critical praise===

Famous science fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]] has said that van Vogt's stories spurred his interest in science fiction with their strange sense of the unexplained, that something more was going on than the protagonists realized.

In a review of ''Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt'', science fiction writer [[Paul Di Filippo]] said:

:''Van Vogt knew precisely what he was doing in all areas of his fiction writing. There's hardly a wasted word in his stories... His plots are marvels of interlocking pieces, often ending in real surprises and shocks, genuine paradigm shifts, which are among the hardest conceptions to depict.  And the intellectual material of his fictions, the conceits and tossed-off observations on culture and human and alien behavior, reflect a probing mind...Each tale contains a new angle, a unique slant, that makes it stand out.'' &lt;br&gt; (DiFilippo, Paul, (2003) ''[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/books2.html Off The Shelf]'', Retrieved [[9 January]] [[2003]]).

===Criticism===

Van Vogt's style has been criticized as confused and incoherent. Writer and critic [[Damon Knight]] wrote in [[1945]] that &quot;van Vogt is not a giant as often mantained. He's only a pygmy using a giant typewriter&quot;.

His technical knowledge seems questionable.  Examples:

*In ''Cosmic Encounter'', one result of the crash of an alien spaceship is the generation of a temperature of minus 50,000 degrees, well below [[absolute zero]].
*The title of his story collection ''M33 in Andromeda'' is incorrect; M33 is in [[Triangulum]], M31 (the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]) is in [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]].
*The popular short story ''Vault of the Beast'' hinges on the concept of the largest [[prime number]]; it was demonstrated as far back as [[Ancient Greece]] that the series of primes is infinite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anna Kournikova.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Anna Kournikova on the cover of [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'' magazine]] in 2004.]]
'''Anna Sergeyevna Kournikova''' ([[Russian (language)|Russian]]: '''–ê–Ω–Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –ö—É—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞''', ''√Ånna Serg√©yevna K√∫rnikova;'' born [[June 7]], [[1981]]) was a professional [[tennis]] player. She was one of the best known tennis players, even among those who do not follow the game. Anna was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] to Alla and Sergei Kournikov; her family later emigrated to the [[United States]], and she currently resides in [[Miami, Florida]]. Anna's major-league tennis career has been curtailed for the past several years by serious back &amp; spinal problems, and this might be the end of it. Anna has had some success at the singles game, but her specialty has been doubles, where she has become the world's #1 doubles player at times, and she has won Grand Slam titles in [[Australia]] in 1999 and 2002, with [[Martina Hingis]] as her partner. With Anna's being taller than the average tennis player, and being strong at the net and at the serve, she fits well into doubles. [Other comparable players have been [[Pam Shriver]] and [[Peter Fleming]], with numerous doubles championships to their credit, playing with shorter partners, such as [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[John McEnroe]]. With their skill and good looks, Anna and Martina jestingly called themselves &quot;The Spice Girls of Tennis&quot;.

==Tennis career==
[[Image:Anna Kournikova plait.jpg|thumb|left|Playing tennis.]]
Kournikova dazzled the world at age 13 and 14 in international junior tennis, winning several tournaments including the [[1995]] [[Rome Masters|Italian Open]]. Kournikova was 14 years old when she ended 1995 as Junior European Champion Under 18 and ITF Junior World Champion Under 18.

Kournikova debuted in professional tennis at age 14 in the [[Fed Cup]] for Russia, the youngest player ever to participate and win. At age 15, she reached the fourth round of the 1996 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], only to be stopped by then-top ranked player [[Steffi Graf]].

Kournikova was a member of the Russian delegation to the [[1996 Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1997, as a 16-year old, she reached the semi-finals of [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], where she lost to the eventual champion, [[Martina Hingis]] by a score of 6-3, 6-2. 1998 was her breakthrough year, when she broke into the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]'s top 20 rankings for the first time and scored impressive victories over [[Martina Hingis]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], and [[Steffi Graf]]. Kournikova's two [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] doubles titles came in [[1999]] and [[2002]], both at the [[Australian Open]] in the Women's Doubles event with partner [[Martina Hingis]], with whom she played frequently starting in 1999.

Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the [[U.S. Open]] and at Wimbledon, and reaching #1 ranking in doubles in the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour rankings. Her pro career doubles record was 200-71. However, her singles career plateaued after 1999. For the most part, she managed to retain her ranking between #10 and #15 (her career high singles ranking was #8), but her expected finals breakthrough failed to occur; she only reached four finals out of 130 singles tournaments, never in a Grand Slam event, and never won one. One contributing factor might have been her habit of entering high-profile events with strong fields of elite players. As a player, Kournikova was noted for her excellent footspeed and aggressive baseline play; however, her flat, high-risk groundstrokes tended to produce high numbers of errors and her serve was sometimes unreliable in singles. [Anyone who wins big at doubles MUST serve well.] She had a record of 209-129 as a singles player.

Her final playing years were marred by a string of injuries, especially back injuries, which saw her ranking gradually erode. Kournikova has not played on the WTA tour since 2003, but still plays exhibition matches for charitable causes. In late 2004, she participated in three events organized by [[Elton John]] and by fellow tennis stars and good friends [[Serena Williams]] and [[Andy Roddick]]. In January [[2005]], she played in a doubles charity event for the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] with [[John McEnroe]], Roddick, and [[Chris Evert]]. 

Anna was also a member of the Newport Beachbreakers in the World Team Tennis (WTT) competition in July and November 2005, playing doubles only. In November 2005 she teamed up with [[Martina Hingis]] playing against [[Lisa Raymond]] and [[Samantha Stosur]] in the WTT finals for charity. In a feature for ''[[Elle]]'' magazine's July 2005 issue, Kournikova stated that if she were 100% fit, she would like to come back and compete again.

==Media publicity==
[[Image:anna12.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kournikova on the July, 2000 cover of [[Sports Illustrated]]]]Much of Anna's fame -- more, many have argued, than she ever gained in her tennis career -- has come from the publicity surrounding her personal life as well as numerous modeling shoots. During her debut at the 1996 U.S. Open 1996 at the age of 15, Kournikova's physical beauty was noticed by the world and soon pictures of her appeared in numerous magazines all over the planet. Anna has fine facial features and an attractive body, topped off by long blonde hair, sometimes braided into a meter-long queue (pony tail).

Many media outlets have reported that Kournikova was very briefly married to NHL hockey star [[Sergei Fedorov]] during the summer of 2001, though her agent and family deny this claim. A number of her relationships with other [[celebrity|celebrities]], including involvements with [[pop music|pop star]] [[Enrique Iglesias]] (whose video, ''Escape'', she appeared in) and hockey player [[Pavel Bure]], have also featured prominently in the [[tabloid|tabloid press]].
 
In 2000 Anna became the new face for [[Berlei]]'s shock absorber sports bras range, and appeared in the highly successful &quot;only the ball should bounce&quot; bill board campaign. Photographs of her scantily-clad form have appeared in various [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]]s, including more than one much-publicized [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]s (2004-05), where she posed in bikinis and swimsuits, and in other popular men's publications such as ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''. So far, she has not posed topless or nude for any publications.
 
Kournikova was named one of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'''s 50 Most Beautiful People in [[1998]], [[2000]], [[2002]], and [[2003]]. She has also been voted &quot;hottest female athlete&quot; and &quot;hottest couple&quot; (with Iglesias) on [[ESPN.com]] and 2003's &quot;sexiest woman in the world&quot; by worldwide [[FHM]] readers for. By contrast, [[ESPN]] -- citing the degree of hype as compared to actual accomplishments as a singles player -- ranked Anna 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in its &quot;25 Biggest Sports Flops of the Past 25 Years&quot;.

Kournikova had a small role (as a motel manager) in the 2000 film ''[[Me, Myself and Irene]]'', starring [[Jim Carrey]].

'''Atheism''', in its broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of [[deity|gods]]. This definition includes as atheists both those who assert that there are no gods, and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not. Narrower definitions, however, often only qualify those who assert there are no gods as atheists, labeling the others as [[nontheism|nontheists]] or [[Agnosticism|agnostics]].

Although atheists often share common concerns regarding [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence and the [[scientific method]] of investigation and a large number are [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]], there is no single [[ideology]] that all atheists share. Additionally, there are certain individuals whose [[Religion|religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs some might describe as atheistic, though those holding such beliefs do not normally describe themselves as atheists. 

Atheism should not be confused with the related, but not equivalent, position of [[antitheism]], as many atheists do not directly oppose theism.

==Etymology==
In early [[Ancient Greek]], the adjective ''atheos'' (from [[privative a|privative ''a-'']] + ''theos'' &quot;gods&quot;) meant &quot;without gods&quot; or &quot;lack of belief in gods&quot;. The word acquired an additional meaning in the [[5th century BCE]], expressing a total lack of relations with the gods; that is, &quot;denying the gods, godless, ungodly&quot;, with more active connotations than ''asebƒìs'', &quot;impious&quot;. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes translate ''atheos'' as &quot;atheistic&quot;. As an abstract noun, there was also ''atheotƒìs'': &quot;atheism&quot;. [[Cicero]] transliterated ''atheos'' into [[Latin]]. The discussion of ''atheoi'' was pronounced in the debate between early Christians and pagans, who each attributed atheism to the other. 

A.B. Drachmann (1922) notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Atheism and atheist are words formed from Greek roots and with Greek derivative endings. Nevertheless they are not Greek; their formation is not consonant with Greek usage. In Greek they said ''atheos'' and ''atheotes''; to these the English words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely. In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''atheos'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced. Not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed. (p.5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[English language|English]], the term ''atheism'' is the result of the adoption of the [[French language|French]] ''ath√©isme'' in about 1587. The term ''atheist'' in the sense of &quot;one who denies or disbelieves&quot; actually predates atheism, being first attested in about 1571 (the phrase ''Italian atheoi'' is recorded as early as 1568). ''Atheist'' in the sense of practical godlessness was first attested in 1577. The French word is derived from ''ath√©e'', &quot;godless, atheist&quot;, which in turn is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''atheos''. The words ''deist'' and ''theist'' entered English after ''atheism'', being first attested in 1621 and 1662, respectively, with ''[[theism]]'' and ''[[deism]]'' following in 1678 and 1682, respectively. ''Deism'' and ''theism'' exchanged meanings around 1700 due to the influence of ''atheism''. ''Deism'' was originally used with a meaning comparable to today's ''theism'', and vice-versa.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] also records an earlier irregular formation, ''atheonism'', dated from about 1534. The later and now obsolete words ''athean'' and ''atheal'' are dated to 1611 and 1612, respectively.

==Types and typologies of atheism==
Many people have disagreed on how best to characterize atheism, and much of the literature on the subject is erroneous or confusing. There are many discrepancies in the use of terminology between proponents and opponents of atheism, and even divergent definitions among those who share near-identical beliefs.

Among proponents of atheism and neutral parties, there are two major traditions in defining atheism and its subdivisions. The first tradition understands atheism very broadly, as including both those who believe gods don't exist (''[[strong atheism]]'') and those who are simply not theists (''[[weak atheism]]''). [[George H. Smith]], [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], and (formerly) [[Antony Flew]] fall into this tradition, though they do not use the same terminology. (Flew has recently adopted a form of [[deism]].)

The second tradition understands atheism more narrowly, as the conscious rejection of theism, and does not consider absence of theistic belief or suspension of judgment concerning theism to be forms of atheism. [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] and [[Kai Nielsen]] are prominent members of this camp. Using this definition of atheism, &quot;[[Atheism#Implicit and explicit atheism|implicit atheism]]&quot;, lack of theism without the conscious rejection of it, may not be regarded as atheistic at all, and the umbrella term ''[[nontheism]]'' may be used in its place.

A third tradition, more common among laypeople, understands atheism even more narrowly than that. Here, atheism is defined in the strongest possible terms, as the belief that there is no god.  Such usage is not exclusive to laypeople, however--atheist philosopher Theodore Drange uses the narrow definition [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/defending.html].

===Atheism as lack of theism===
Among modern atheists, the view that atheism means &quot;without [or, polemically, &quot;free of&quot;] theistic beliefs&quot; has a great deal of currency. This very broad definition is justified by reference to etymology as well as consistent usage of the word by atheists. 

However, this definition of atheism has not gone unchallenged. Although, over the last few hundred years, atheism has evolved and broadened beyond the narrow meaning of &quot;wickedness&quot;, impiety, heresy and religious denial, as well as [[pantheism]] and similar beliefs, it is less commonly understood to include everything not explicitly theistic. Whether a writer's definition of atheism as an &quot;absence&quot; or &quot;lack&quot; of theistic belief is in fact intended to mean &quot;not theistic&quot; in the widest possible sense, or just refers to particular forms of the rejection of theism (see below), is often ambiguous.

However, while this definition of atheism is frequently disputed, it is not a recent invention; this use has a history spanning over 230 years. Two atheist writers who are clear in defining atheism so broadly that uninformed children are counted as atheists are d'Holbach (1772) (&quot;All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God&quot; [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/gsens10.txt]) and George H. Smith (1979).

According to Smith,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child without the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist. (p.14) [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One atheist writer who explicitly disagrees with such a broad definition is Ernest Nagel (1965):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief... Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist - for he is not denying any theistic claims. (p.460-461)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Nagel, atheism is the ''rejection'' of theism, not just the absence of theistic belief. However, this definition leaves open the question of what term can be used to describe those who lack theistic belief, but do not necessarily reject theism.

The obsolete word ''atheous'', first recorded in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a synonym of atheism or impiety, is sometimes used to mean &quot;not dealing with the existence of a god&quot; in a purely privative sense, as distinguished from the negative ''atheistic''. This 1880 coinage captures some of what is intended by the broad definition of atheism, though it is hard to sustain the claim that the philosophical rejection of theism can be characterized in such terms.

====Implicit and explicit atheism====
[[Image:Atheismimplicitexplicit2.PNG|thumb|230px|A chart showing the relationship between the weak/strong (positive/negative) and implicit/explicit dichotomies. Strong atheism is always explicit, and implicit atheism is always weak.]]
The terms ''implicit atheism'' and ''explicit atheism'' were coined by George H. Smith (1979, p.13-18). 

Implicit atheism is defined by Smith as &quot;the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it.&quot; Explicit atheism is defined as &quot;the absence of theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it&quot;, which, according to Smith, is sometimes called ''antitheism'' (see below). 

For Smith, explicit atheism is subdivided further according to whether or not the rejection is on rational grounds. The term ''critical atheism'' is used to label the view that belief in god is irrational, and is itself subdivided into a) the view usually expressed by the statement &quot;I do not believe in the existence of a god or supernatural being&quot;; b) the view usually expressed by the statement, &quot;god does not exist&quot; or &quot;the existence of god is impossible&quot;; and c) the view which &quot;refuses to discuss the existence or nonexistence of a god&quot; because &quot;the concept of a god is unintelligible&quot; (p.17).

Although Nagel rejects Smith's definition of atheism as merely &quot;lack of theism&quot;, acknowledging only explicit &quot;atheism&quot; as true atheism, his tripartite classification of ''rejectionist atheism'' (commonly found in the philosophical literature) is identical to Smith's ''critical atheism'' typology.

The difference between Nagel on the one hand and d'Holbach and Smith on the other has been attributed to the different concerns of professional philosophers and layman proponents of atheism (see Smith (1990, Chapter 3, p.51-60 [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm]), for example, but also alluded to by others).

Everitt (2004) makes the point that professional philosophers are more interested in the grounds for giving or withholding assent to propositions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We need to distinguish between a ''biographical'' or ''sociological'' enquiry into why some people have believed or disbelieved in God, and an ''epistemological'' enquiry into whether there are any good reasons for either belief or unbelief... We are interested in the question of what ''good reasons'' there are for or against God's existence, and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having good reasons for them. (p.10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, in philosophy (Flew and Martin notwithstanding), atheism is commonly defined along the lines of &quot;rejection of theistic belief&quot;. This is often misunderstood to mean only the view that there is no God, but it is conventional to distinguish between two or three main sub-types of atheism in this sense (writers differ in their characterization of this distinction, and in the labels they use for these positions).

The terms ''weak atheism'' and ''strong atheism'' (or ''negative atheism'' and ''positive atheism'') are often used as synonyms of Smith's less-well-known ''implicit'' and ''explicit'' categories. However, the original and technical meanings of implicit and explicit atheism are quite different and distinct from weak and strong atheism, having to do with conscious rejection and unconscious rejection of theism rather than with positive belief and negative belief.

People who do not use the broad definition of atheism as &quot;lack of theism&quot;, but instead use the most common definition &quot;disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods&quot; [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=atheism] would not recognize mere absence of belief in deities (implicit atheism) as a type of atheism at all, and would tend to use other terms, such as &quot;skeptic&quot; or &quot;agnostic&quot; or &quot;non-atheistic nontheism&quot;, for this position.

===Atheism as immorality===
The first attempts to define or develop a typology of atheism were in religious apologetics. These attempts were expressed in terminologies and in contexts which reflected the religious assumptions and prejudices of the writers. A diversity of atheist opinion has been recognized at least since [[Plato]], and common distinctions have been established between ''practical atheism'' and ''speculative'' or ''contemplative atheism''.

====Practical atheism====
Practical atheism was said to be caused by moral failure, hypocrisy, willful ignorance and infidelity. Practical atheists ''behaved'' as though God, morals, ethics and social responsibility did not exist. Maritain's typology of atheism (1953, Chapter 8) proved influential in Catholic circles; it was followed in the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (see Reid (1967)). He identified, in addition to practical atheism, ''pseudo-atheism'' and ''absolute atheism'' (and subdivided theoretical atheism in a way that anticipated Flew). For an atheist critique of Maritain, see Smith (1979, Chapter 1, Section 5) [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm].

According to the French Catholic philosopher √âtienne Borne (1961, p.10), &quot;Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law.&quot; 

According to [[Karen Armstrong]] (1999):

&lt;blockquote&gt; During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for polemic... In his tract ''Atheism Closed and Open Anatomized'' (1634), John Wingfield claimed: &quot;the hypocrite is an Atheist; the loose wicked man is an open Atheist; the secure, bold and proud transgressor is an Atheist: he that will not be taught or reformed is an Atheist&quot;. For the [[Wales|Welsh]] poet [[William Vaughan]] (1577 [sic]-1641), who helped in the colonisation of [[Newfoundland]], those who raised rents or enclosed commons were obvious atheists. The English dramatist [[Thomas Nashe]] (1567-1601) proclaimed that the ambitious, the greedy, the gluttons, the vainglorious and prostitutes were all atheists. The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist. (p.331-332) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, the existence of serious speculative atheism was often denied. That anyone might ''reason'' their way to atheism was thought to be impossible. Thus, speculative atheism was collapsed into a form of practical atheism, or conceptualized as hatred of God, or a fight against God. This is why Borne finds it necessary to say, &quot;to put forward the idea, as some apologists rashly do, that there are no atheists except in name but only 'practical atheists' who through pride or idleness disregard the divine law, would be, at least at the beginning of the argument, a rhetorical convenience or an emotional prejudice evading the real question.&quot; (p.18)

Martin (1990, p.465-466) suggests that practical atheism would be better described as ''alienated theism''.

====Other pejorative definitions of atheism====
When denial of the existence of &quot;speculative&quot; atheism became unsustainable, atheism was nevertheless often repressed and criticized by narrowing definitions, applying charges of dogmatism, and otherwise misrepresenting atheist positions. One of the reasons for the popularity of euphemistic alternative terms like [[secularism|secularist]], [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[agnosticism|agnostic]], or [[bright (noun)|bright]] is that ''atheism'' still has pejorative connotations arising from attempts at suppression and from its association with practical atheism (''godless'' is still used as an abusive epithet).

Mynga Futrell and Paul Geisert, the originators of the term ''Bright'', made this explicit in an essay published in 2003:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our personal frustration regarding labels reached culmination last fall when we were invited to join a march on Washington as &quot;Godless Americans.&quot; The causes of the march were worthy, and the march itself well planned and conducted. However, to unite for common interests under a disparaging term like godless (it also means &quot;wicked&quot;) seemed ludicrous! Why accept and utilize the very derogatory language that so clearly hampers our own capacity to play a positive and contributing role in our communities and in the nation and world? [http://www.the-brights.net/vision/essays/futrell_geisert_nix.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gaskin (1989) abandoned the term ''atheism'' in favour of ''unbelief'', citing &quot;the pejorative associations of the term, its vagueness, and later the tendency of religious apologists to define atheism so that no one could be an atheist...&quot; (p.4)

Despite these considerations, for others ''atheist'' has always been the preferred name. [[Charles Bradlaugh]] once said (in debate with [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[10 March]] [[1870]], cited in Bradlaugh Bonner (1908)):

&lt;blockquote&gt;I maintain that the opprobrium cast upon the word Atheism is a lie. I believe Atheists as a body to be men deserving respect... I do not care what kind of character religious men may put round the word Atheist, I would fight until men respect it. (p.334) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For more on repressive definitions of atheism, see Berman (1982), (1983), (1990).

===Weak and strong atheism===
:''Main articles: [[Weak atheism]], [[Strong atheism]]'' 

''[[Weak atheism]]'', sometimes called ''soft atheism'', ''negative atheism'' or ''neutral atheism'', is the absence of belief in the existence of [[deity|deities]] without the positive assertion that deities do not exist. ''[[Strong atheism]]'', also known as ''hard atheism'' or ''positive atheism'', is the belief that no deities exist.

While the terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, the concepts they represent have been in use for some time. In earlier philosophical publications, the terms ''negative atheism'' and ''positive atheism'' were more common; these terms were used by [[Antony Flew]] in 1972, although [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953, Chapter 8, p.104) used the phrases in a similar, but strictly Catholic apologist, context as early as 1949 [http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm].

Although explicit atheists ([[nontheism|nontheists]] who consciously reject theism), may subscribe to either ''weak'' or ''strong'' atheism, weak atheism also includes implicit atheists - that is, nontheists who have not consciously rejected theism, but lack theistic belief, arguably including infants.

Theists claim that a single deity or group of deities exists. Weak atheists do not assert the contrary; instead, they only refrain from assenting to theistic claims. Some weak atheists are without any opinion regarding the existence of deities, either because of a lack of thought on the matter, a lack of interest in the matter (see [[apatheism]]), or a belief that the arguments and evidence provided by both theists and strong atheists are equally unpersuasive. Others (explicit weak atheists) may doubt or dispute claims for the existence of deities, while not actively asserting that deities do not exist, following [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] famous dictum, &quot;Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must remain silent.&quot;

Some weak atheists feel that theism and strong atheism are equally untenable, on the grounds that faith is required both to assert and to deny the existence of deities, and as such both theism and strong atheism have the burden of proof placed on them to prove that a god does or doesn't exist. Some also base their belief on the notion that it is impossible to prove a negative.

While a weak atheist might consider the nonexistence of deities likely on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to justify belief in a deity's existence, a strong atheist has the additional view that positive statements of nonexistence are merited when evidence or arguments indicate that a deity's nonexistence is certain or probable.

Strong atheism may be based on arguments that the concept of a deity is self-contradictory and therefore impossible (positive [[ignosticism]]), or that one or more of the properties attributed to a deity are incompatible with what we observe in the world.  Examples of this may be found in quantum physics, where the existence of mutually exclusive data negates the possibility of omniscience, usually a core attribute of monotheistic conceptions of deity.

''[[Agnosticism]]'' is distinct from strong atheism, though many weak atheists may be agnostics, and those who are strong atheists with regard to a particular deity might be weak atheists or agnostics with regard to other deities.

===Ignosticism===
:''Main article: [[Ignosticism]]''

Ignosticism is the view that the question of whether or not deities exist is inherently meaningless. It is a popular view among many [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] such as [[Rudolph Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], who hold that talk of gods is literally [[nonsense]]. According to ignostics, &quot;Does a god exist?&quot; has the same logical status as &quot;What color is Saturday?&quot;; they are both nonsensical, and thus have no meaningful answers.

Ignostics commonly hold that statements about religious or other transcendent experiences cannot have any truth value, often because theological statements lack [[falsifiability]], because of an [[epistemology|epistemological]] view that renders the [[ontological argument]] nonsensical, or because the terminology being used has not been properly or consistently defined &amp;mdash; the latter view is known as [[theological noncognitivism]].

The use of the word &quot;god&quot; is thus solely a matter of [[semantics]] to ignostics, dealing with word use and technicalities rather than with existence and reality.

In ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Ayer stated that theism, atheism and agnosticism were equally meaningless, insofar as they treat the question of the existence of God as a real question. However, there are varieties of atheism and agnosticism which do not necessarily agree that the question is meaningful, especially using the &quot;lack of theism&quot; definition of atheism. Despite Ayer's criticism of atheism (perhaps using the definition typically associated with [[strong atheism]]), Ignosticism is usually counted as a form of atheism; Ayer (1966) was clear on his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it. (p226) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ignostic position is mentioned (though the term ''ignostic'' is not used) as one of the three forms of &quot;critical atheism&quot; (in Smith) or &quot;rejectionist atheism&quot; (in Nagel). Active disbelief in god or supernatural beings is one other type of critical/rejectionist atheism. Finally, the third type is the positive claim that deities do not exist. Since critical/rejectionist atheism is a type of explicit atheism, if follows that ignosticism is a type of explicit atheism. There is some debate over whether it should be classified as [[weak atheism]] or [[strong atheism]].

Ignosticism is distinct from apatheism in that while ignostics hold ''questions'' and ''discussions'' of whether deities exist to be meaningless, apatheists hold that even a hypothetical ''answer'' to such questions would be completely irrelevant to human existence.

===Gnostic and agnostic atheism===
:''Main article: [[Agnostic atheism]]''

Agnostic atheism is a fusion of atheism or [[nontheism]] with [[agnosticism]], the [[epistemology|epistemological]] position that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown ([[weak agnosticism]]) or unknowable ([[strong agnosticism]]). Agnostic atheism is typically contrasted with [[agnostic theism]], the belief that deities exist even though it is impossible to know that deities exist, and with gnostic atheism, the belief that there is enough information to determine that deities do not exist.

''Agnostic atheism'''s definition varies, just as the definitions of agnosticism and atheism do. It may be a combination of lack of theism with [[strong agnosticism]], the view that it is impossible to know whether deities exist to any reliable degree. It may also be a combination of lack of theism with [[weak agnosticism]], the view that there is not currently enough information to decide whether or not a deity exists, but that there may be enough in the future.

''Gnostic atheism'' is a more rarely used term, because often anyone who is not labeled as agnostic is assumed to be gnostic by default. Gnostic atheism also has varying meanings. When nontheism is combined with strong gnosticism, it denotes the belief that it is rational to be absolutely certain that deities do not, and perhaps cannot, exist. When it is with weak gnosticism, it denotes the belief that there is enough information to be reasonably sure that deities do not exist, but not absolutely certain. The term should not be confused with [[Gnosticism]]. 

''Gnostic atheism'' is also sometimes used as a synonym of [[strong atheism]], and thus ''agnostic atheism'' is occasionally a synonym for [[weak atheism]]. This is similar to the more common confusion of the terms ''implicit atheism'' and ''explicit atheism'' with strong and weak atheism.

[[Apatheism]] often overlaps with agnostic atheism, such as with [[apathetic agnosticism]], a fusion of apatheism with strong agnostic atheism.

===Atheism in philosophical naturalism===
Many, if not most, atheists have preferred to say that atheism is a lack of a belief, rather than a belief in its own right (see, for example, Krueger (1998, p.22-24); Smith (1979, p.15-16)). This keeps the burden of proof on the theist (see Flew (1984b)), as the only one making any positive assertions. &quot;Belief&quot; also has other connotations that many atheists may wish to avoid. 

Nevertheless, some atheist writers identify atheism with the [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic world view]], and defend it on that basis. The case for naturalism is used as a positive argument for atheism. See, for example, Thrower (1971), Harbour (2001), [[Kai Nielsen|Nielsen]] (2001) and [[Julian Baggini|Baggini]] (2003). See also Everitt's discussion of an anti-atheist argument against naturalism (2004, Chapter 9, p.178-190).

According to Thrower,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Much atheism... can be understood only in the light of the current theism which it was concerned to reject. Such atheism is relative. There is, however, a way of looking at and interpreting events in the world, whose origins... can be seen as early as the beginnings of speculative thought itself, and which I shall call naturalistic, that is atheistic per se, in the sense that it is incompatible with any and every form of supernaturalism... naturalistic or absolute atheism is both fundamentally more important, and more interesting, representing as it does one polarity in the development of the human spirit. (p.3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Julian Baggini]] argues that, &quot;atheism can be understood not simply as a denial of religion, but as a self-contained belief system, if it is seen as a commitment to the view that there is only one world and this is the world of nature&quot; (p.74). For Baggini, therefore,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the evidence for atheism is to be found in the fact that there is a plethora of evidence for the truth of naturalism and an absence of evidence for anything else. 'Anything else' of course includes God, but it also includes goblins, hobbits, and truly everlasting gobstoppers. There is nothing special about God in this sense. God is just one of the things that atheists don't believe in, it just happens to be the thing that, for historical reasons, gave them their name. (p.17) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baggini's position is that &quot;an atheist does not usually believe in the existence of immortal souls, life after death, ghosts, or supernatural powers. Although strictly speaking an atheist could believe in any of these things and still remain an atheist... the arguments and ideas that sustain atheism tend naturally to rule out other beliefs in the supernatural or transcendental&quot; (p.3-4).

[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] (1990, p.470) notes that the view that &quot;naturalism is compatible with nonatheism is true only if 'god' is understood in a most peculiar and misleading way&quot;, but he also points out that &quot;atheism does not entail naturalism&quot;.

===Antitheism===
:''Main article: [[Antitheism]]''

''Antitheism'' (sometimes hyphenated) typically refers to a direct opposition to [[theism]]. In this use, it is a form of critical [[strong atheism]]. Antitheism may sometimes overlap with [[ignosticism]], the view that theism is inherently meaningless, and may directly contradict [[apatheism]], the view that theism is irrelevant rather than dangerous.

However, ''antitheism'' is also sometimes used, particularly in religious contexts, to refer to opposition to [[God]] or [[divine]] things, rather than to the belief in God. Using the latter definition, it may be possible &amp;mdash; or perhaps even necessary &amp;mdash; to be an antitheist without being an atheist or nontheist.

Antitheists may believe that theism is actually harmful, or may simply be atheists who have little tolerance for views they perceive as [[irrationality|irrational]]. Strong atheists who are not antitheists may believe positively that deities do not exist, but not believe that theism is directly harmful or necessitates opposition.

==History==
{{main|History of atheism}}

Although the actual term ''atheism'' originated in 16th Century [[France]], ideas that would be recognized as atheistic today existed even before [[Classical Antiquity]]. [[Epicurus]] proposed theories that can be classified as atheistic, such as a lack of belief in an afterlife, though he remained ambiguous concerning the actual existence of deities. Before him, [[Socrates]] was [[Trial of Socrates|sentenced to death]] partly on the grounds that he was an atheist, although he did express belief in several forms of divinity, as recorded in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]''. This criminal connotation attached to atheistic ideas ([[heresy]]) would remain, at varying levels of severity, until [[the Renaissance]], when criticism of the Church became more prevalent and tolerated.

Atheism disappeared from the philosophy of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] traditions as [[Christianity]] gained influence. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of atheism re-emerged as an accusation against those who questioned the religious [[status quo]], but by the late 18th century it had become the philosophical position of a growing minority. By the 20th century, along with the spread of [[rationalism]] and [[secular humanism]], atheism had become common, particularly among [[scientist|scientists]] (see [[#International survey of contemporary atheism|international survey of contemporary atheism]]). In the 20th Century, atheism also became a staple of the various [[Communism|Communist]] regimes, helping return some of the negative connotations of atheism, especially in the [[United States]], where the term became synonymous with being unpatriotic during the [[Cold War]].

==Distribution of atheists==
Though atheists are a minority group in most countries, they are relatively common in [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], in former and present [[communist state]]s, and, to a lesser extent, in the [[United States]].

Atheism is particularly prevalent among [[scientist]]s, a tendency already quite marked at the beginning of the 20th century, developing into a dominant one during the course of the century. In 1914, [[James H. Leuba]] found that 58% of 1,000 randomly selected U.S. [[natural science|natural scientists]] expressed &quot;disbelief or doubt in the existence of God&quot;. The same study, repeated in 1996, gave a similar percentage of 60.7%; this number is 93% among the members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. Expressions of positive disbelief rose from 52% to 72%. [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html] (See also [[The relationship between religion and science]]). 

===Atheism in the United Kingdom===
A poll in 2004 by the [[BBC]] put the number of people who do not believe in God to be 40% [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3518375.stm], while a [[YouGov]] poll in the same year put the percentage of non-believers at 35% with 21% uncertain
[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/graphics/2004/12/27/nfaith27big.gif]. In the YouGov poll men were less likely to 
believe in god than women and younger people were less likely to believe in god than older people.

In early 2004, it was announced that atheism would be taught during religious education classes in the [[United Kingdom]]. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,6903,1148578,00.html] A spokesman for the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] stated: &quot;There are many children in England who have no religious affiliation and their beliefs and ideas, whatever they are, should be taken very seriously.&quot; There is also considerable debate in the U.K. on the status of [[faith-based schools]], which use religious as well as academic selection criteria. The decision was based on a Parliament decision ruling that, while questionable in moral standing, Atheism is a legitimate religion (although atheism is not a religion in any sense, this indicates that atheism should be treated the same as theism). Atheism is championed by many scientists and [[philosophers]] in the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Richard Dawkins]].

===Atheism in the United States===
A [[Gallup poll]] in 2005 showed 5% of the US population feel that God does not exist [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001659292]. A poll in 2004 by the [[BBC]] showed the number of people who don't believe in God to be larger, at 10% [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3518375.stm]. However, unbelief in God does not imply self-identification as an atheist.

Atheists are ostensibly legally protected from discrimination in the United States. They have been among the strongest advocates of the legal [[separation of church and state]]. American courts have regularly, if controversially, interpreted the constitutional requirement for separation of church and state as protecting the freedoms of non-believers, as well as prohibiting the establishment of any state religion. Atheists often sum up the legal situation with the phrase: &quot;Freedom of religion also means freedom ''from'' religion.&quot; [http://www.au.org/]

In [[Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet]][http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=U10355], Justice Souter wrote in the opinion for the Court that: &quot;government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to [[irreligion]].&quot; [http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-517.ZS.html] [[Everson v. Board of Education]] established that &quot;''neither a state nor the Federal Government can''...'' pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another''&quot;. This applies the Establishment Clause to the states as well as the federal government. [http://atheism.about.com/library/decisions/religion/bl_l_BoEEverson.htm] However, several state constitutions make the protection of persons from religious discrimination conditional on their acknowledgement of the existence of a deity, apparently making freedom of religion in those states inapplicable to atheists. These state constitutional clauses have not been tested. Additionally, some state constitutions (namely, [[Arkansas Constitution|Arkansas]] and [[South Carolina Constitution|South Carolina]]) disallow atheists to hold public office, although most agree that, if challenged, these requirements would be ruled unconstitutional under [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] which bans such qualifications. Civil rights cases are typically brought in federal courts; so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance.
 	
In the [[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow|Newdow case]], after a father challenged the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the United States [[Pledge of Allegiance]], the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the phrase unconstitutional. Although the decision was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal, there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be legally usable without modification in schools in the western United States, over which the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction. This resulted in political furor, and both houses of Congress passed resolutions condemning the decision, nearly unanimously. A very large group consisting of almost the entire Senate and House was televised standing on the steps of Congress, hands over hearts, swearing the pledge and shouting out &quot;under God&quot;. The Supreme Court subsequently reversed the decision, ruling that [[Michael Newdow]] did not have standing to bring his case, thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge.

==Atheism studies and statistics==
As some governments have strongly promoted atheism, whilst others have strongly condemned it, atheism may be either over-reported or under-reported for different countries. There is a great deal of room for debate as to the accuracy of any method of estimation, as the opportunity for misreporting (intentionally or not) a belief system without an organized structure is high. Also, many surveys on religious identification ask people to identify themselves as &quot;agnostics&quot; or &quot;atheists&quot;, which is potentially confusing, since these terms are interpreted differently by many different people, with some identifying themselves as being both atheist and agnostic. Additionally, many of these surveys only gauge the number of [[irreligion|irreligious]] people, not the number of actual atheists, or group the two together.

The following surveys are in chronological order, but as they are different studies with different methodologies it would be inaccurate to infer trends on the prevalence of atheism from them:

*A 1995 survey [http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html] attributed to the [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] indicates that the non-religious are about 14.7% of the world's population, and atheists around 3.8%.

*The 2001 [http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm ARIS report] found that while 29.5 million U.S. Americans (14.1%) describe themselves as &quot;without religion&quot;, only 902,000 (0.4%) positively claim to be atheist, with another 991,000 (0.5%) professing agnosticism.

*In the 2001 Australian Census [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/9658217eba753c2cca256cae00053fa3?OpenDocument] 15.5% of respondents ticked &quot;no religion&quot;, and a further 11.7% either did not state their religion or were deemed to have described it inadequately (there was a popular and successful campaign at the time to have people describe themselves as [[Jedi census phenomenon|Jedi]]).

*The 2001 [[New Zealand]] census [http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/Articles/census-snpsht-cult-diversity-Mar02.htm] showed that 40% of the respondents claimed &quot;no religion&quot;.

*In 2001, the [http://www.czso.cz/csu/edicniplan.nsf/o/4110-03--skladba_obyvatelstva_podle_nabozenskeho_vyznani,_pohlavi_a_podle_veku Czech Statistical Office] provided census information on the ten million people in the [[Czech Republic]]. 59% had no religion, 32.2% were religious, and 8.8% did not answer. This suggests that the Czech Republic is probably the most atheistic country in the world.

*In 2002 survey in [[Demographics of Russia|Russia]], 32% self-described as atheist. Of the 58% self-describing as Russian Orthodox Christian, 42% said they had never been in a church.

*A 2002 survey by Adherents.com [http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html] estimates the proportion of the world's people who are &quot;secular, non-religious, agnostics and atheists&quot; as about 14%.

*In a 2003 poll in [[France]], 54% of those polled identified themselves as &quot;faithful&quot;, 33% as atheist, 14% as agnostic, and 26% as &quot;[[apatheism|indifferent]]&quot;. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35454.htm]

*A 2004 survey by the BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3518375.stm] in 10 countries showed the proportion of the population &quot;who don't believe in God&quot; varying between 0% and 44%, with an average close to 17% in the countries surveyed. About 8% of the respondents stated specifically that they consider themselves to be atheists.

*A 2004 survey by the CIA in the World Factbook [http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/xx.html#People] estimates about 12.5% of the world's population are non-religious, and about 2.4% are atheists. 

*A 2004 survey by the [[Pew Research Center]] [http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=757] showed that in the United States, 12% of people under 30 and 6% of people over 30 could be characterized as non-religious.

*A 2005 poll by AP/Ipsos [http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2694] surveyed ten countries. Of the developed nations, people in the [[United States]] had most certainty about the existence of god or a higher power (2% atheist, 4% agnostic), while [[France]] had the most skeptics (19% atheist, 16% agnostic). On the religion question, [[South Korea]] had the greatest percentage without a religion (41%) while [[Italy]] had the smallest (5%).

* A 2006 survey in the Norwegian newspaper [[Aftenposten]] (on [[February 17]]), saw 1006 inhabitants of [[Norway]] answering the question &quot;What do you believe in?&quot;. 29% answered &quot;I believe in a god or deity&quot;, 23% answered &quot;I believe in a higher power without being certain of what&quot;, 26% answered &quot;I don't believe in god or higher powers&quot;, and 22% answered &quot;I am in doubt&quot;. Depending on the definition of atheism, Norway thus has between 49% and 71% atheists. Still, some 85% of the population are members of the Norwegian state's official [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] church. Parts of this deviance is due to the fact that all non-affilated Norwegians were signed into this church a few years before (without being asked), and that signing out, if they are even aware of being signed in, is a time-consuming, bureaucratic affair yielding no immediate gains.

===Statistical problems===
Statistics on atheism are often difficult to accurately represent for a variety of reasons.

====Atheism is nonexclusive====
Atheism is a position compatible with other forms of identity. Some atheists also consider themselves [[Agnosticism|Agnostic]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Jainism|Jains]] or hold other related philosophical beliefs. Therefore, given limited poll options, some may use other terms to describe their identity.

====Misrepresentation====
Some politically motivated organizations that report or gather population statistics may, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresent atheists. Survey designs may bias results due to the nature of elements such as the wording of questions and the available response options. Also, many atheists, particularly former Catholics, are still counted as [[Christianity|Christian]]s in church rosters, although surveys generally ask samples of the population and do not look in church rosters. Some Christians believe that ''&quot;once a person is &lt;nowiki&gt;[truly]&lt;/nowiki&gt; saved, that person is always saved&quot;'', a doctrine known as [[Perseverance of the saints|eternal security]]. [http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternalsecurity1.htm].

====Attitudes toward religion====
Statistics are generally collected on the assumption that religion is a categorical variable. As terms such as ''weak atheism'' and ''strong atheism'' suggest, however, people vary in terms of the strength of their convictions. Instruments have been designed to measure attitudes toward religion, including one that was used by [[L. L. Thurstone]]. This may be a particularly important consideration among people who have neutral attitudes, as it is more likely prevailing social norms will influence the responses of such people on survey questions which effectively force respondents to categorize themselves either as belonging to a particular relgion or belonging to no religion.

====Misunderstanding and external pressure====
A negative perception of atheists and pressure from family and peers may also cause some atheists to disassociate themselves from atheism. Misunderstanding of the term may also be a reason some label themselves differently.

====Discrimination====
Legal and social discrimination against atheists in some places may lead some to deny or conceal their atheism due to fears of persecution.

For example, in the 20th century, atheists, socialists and communists were persecuted alongside Jews by the Nazis, who lumped all of these terms into one complex issue or theme ('the Jewish-Bolshevik world conspiracy', as addressed in [[Joseph Goebbels]]' 1935 speech &quot;Communism with the Mask Off&quot;, in which Christian civilization -national socialism- was described as antithetical to Jewish Communism).

==Religion and atheism==
===Spiritual and religious atheism===
Although atheistic beliefs are often accompanied by a total lack of [[supernatural]] beliefs, this is not an aspect, or even a necessary consequence, of atheism. Indeed, there are many atheists who are not [[irreligion|irreligious]] or [[secularism|secular]]. These are most common in spiritualities like [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], but they also exist in sects of religions that are usually very theistic by nature, such as [[Christianity]], especially in some [[Religious Society of Friends|Liberal Quaker]] groups.
 
A number of atheistic churches have been established, such as the [http://thomasinechurch.org/ Thomasine Church], [[Naturalistic pantheism|naturalistic pantheists]], [[Brianism]], and the [[Fellowship of Reason]]. There is also an atheist presence in [[Unitarian Universalism]], an extremely [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] religion. 

====Belief in God as a non-being====
In English, believers usually refer to the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Abrahamic god as &quot;[[God]]&quot;. In many abstract or esoteric interpretations of monotheism or [[henotheism]], God is not thought of as a supernatural being, as a deity or god. Rather, God becomes a philosophical category: the All, the One, the [[Ultimate]], the [[Absolute Infinite]], the [[Transcendent]], the Divine Ground, [[Being]] or [[Existence]] itself, etc. For example, such views are typical of [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], and religious [[monism]]. Attributing [[anthropomorphic]] characteristics to God may be regarded as idolatry, blasphemy, or symbolism by some. Some theists may not believe in, or may even deny, the existence of deities as supernatural beings, while maintaining a belief in god as so conceived.

For example, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[Paul Tillich]] described God as the &quot;ground of Being&quot;, the &quot;power of Being&quot;, or as &quot;Being itself&quot;, and caused controversy by making the statement that &quot;God does not exist&quot;, resulting in him occasionally being labelled as an atheist. Nevertheless, for [[Tillich]], God is not &quot;a&quot; being that exists among other beings, but is Being itself. For him, God does not &quot;exist&quot; except as a concept or principle; God is the basis of Being, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] power by which Being triumphs over non-Being.

However, most atheists who deny the existence of deities as supernatural beings would also deny this and similar conceptions of God, or simply consider them incomprehensible. Even the broadest definitions of atheism often do not include belief in a conceptual or metaphysical God, categorizing this under theism instead.

===Judaism===
In general, formulations of [[Jewish principles of faith]] require a belief in God (represented by Judaism's paramount prayer, the [[Shema]]). In many modern movements in Judaism, rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a Jew to be the determining factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of Judaism. Within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a Jew to strictly practise [[Judaism]] as a faith, while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist, giving rise to the joke: &quot;Q: What do you call a Jew who doesn't believe in God? A: A Jew.&quot; It is also worth noting that [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionism]] does not require any belief in a deity, and that certain popular [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] prayer books, such as ''Gates of Prayer'', offer some services without mention of God.

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] [http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk16-kook.htm][http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk17-kook.htm], first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in pre-state Israel, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an idol, Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of God, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.

Some Jewish atheists reject Judaism, but wish to continue identifying themselves with the Jewish people and culture. See, for example, Levin (1995).  Jewish atheists who practice [[Humanistic Judaism]] embrace Jewish culture and history, rather than belief in a supernatural god, as the sources of their Jewish identity.

===Christianity===
By necessity, Christianity, as a [[theist|theistic]] and [[proselyte|proselytising]] religion views atheism as sinful.  According to [[Psalm 14:1]], &quot;The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.&quot; According to John 3:18-19, all who reject Christianity (and presumably its attendant theism) do so &quot;because their deeds are evil&quot;.

A famous but idiosyncratic atheistic belief is that of [[Thomas Altizer]]. His book ''The Gospel of Christian Atheism'' (1967) proclaims the highly unusual view that God has literally died, or self-annihilated. According to Altizer, this is nevertheless &quot;a Christian confession of faith&quot; (p.102). Making clear the difference between his position and that of both [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] notion of the death of God and the stance of theological non-realists, Altizer says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event, not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time or history, but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense.(p.103)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, many would dispute whether this is an atheist position at all, as belief in a dead God implies that God once existed and was alive. Atheism typically entails a lack of belief that any gods ''ever'' existed, as opposed to not existing currently. For further discussion, see Lyas (1970).

Other, unrelated practitioners of Christian atheism may include [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal Christian]] atheists who follow the teaching of [[Jesus]], but who may not believe in the literal existence of god. In this case, however, many would dispute whether the atheists in question are truly [[Christianity|Christians]], though they certainly are by some of the looser definitions of the word.

It should be noted that although Christianity as a ''faith'' has to be construed as irreconcilable with atheism, this is markedly not the case regarding the church institutions which currently are nominally Christian. Indeed the great [[Positivism|positivist]] luminaries in all earnestness encompassed a Catholic Church which would retain all it's ceremonies and ecclesiastical structures, whilst transforming into a purely atheistic church, much in the same way that christianity has co-opted the organisational traditions of the native faiths it has encountered around the world, and through the ages.

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], atheists are categorized as [[kafir]] (ŸÉÿßŸÅÿ±), a term that is also used to describe polytheists, and that translates roughly as &quot;denier&quot; or &quot;concealer&quot;. The noun ''kafir'' carries connotations of blasphemy and disconnection from the Islamic community. In Arabic, &quot;atheism&quot; is generally translated ''ilhad'' (ÿ•ŸÑÿ≠ÿßÿØ), although this also means &quot;heresy&quot;.
As the [[Sharia]] punishment for [[apostasy]] in Islam is [[death penalty|death]] and such apostasy is also widely socially disapproved of, atheists (as well as converts from Islam to other religions) in Islamic countries and communities frequently conceal their non-belief. The surveys mentioned above that indicate 100% religious belief in certain Islamic countries should be interpreted in light of this fact.

===Asian spirituality===
It is difficult to categorize the Eastern thought systems in distinct terms of theism or atheism. Therefore, it should be noted that even the thoughts that would be characterized as atheistic in the western sense, often have some theistic tendencies, and vice versa.

[[Carvaka]] (also ''Charvaka'') was a [[materialist]] and atheist school of thought in [[India]], which is now known principally from fragments cited by its [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Carvakan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world (cf [[Epicureanism]]). There is some evidence that the school persisted until at least 1578. 

[[Buddhism]] is often described as atheistic, since Buddhist authorities and canonical texts do not affirm, and sometimes deny, the following:

* The existence of a [[creation]], and therefore of a creator god
* That a god, gods, or other divine beings are the source of moral imperatives
* That human beings or other creatures are responsible to a god or gods for their actions

Buddhists might also be deemed atheistic in anti-Buddhist Hindu polemic, since Buddhists opposed the authority of the [[Vedas]] and of Vedic priests, and the power of the rituals of [[Vedic religion]].

However, all canonical Buddhist texts that mention the subject accept the ''existence'' (as distinct from the ''authority'') of a great number of deities, including the Vedic deities.  From the point of view of Western theism, certain concepts of the [[Buddha]] found in the [[Mahayana]] school of Buddhism, e.g. of [[Amitabha]] or the Adibuddha may seem to share characteristics with Western concepts of God. 

Other schools continue to consider themselves as fundamentally atheistic, in the strong sense of the term. [[Jainism]] is also sometimes classified as atheistic since Jains's believe that &quot;In the most basic sense, God is not seen as a person, place or tangible thing, but as the ideal state of an individual soul's existence&quot; [http://www.dd-b.net/~raphael/jain-list/msg01226.html].

[[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] are arguably atheistic in the sense that they do not explicitly affirm, nor are they founded upon a faith in, a higher being or beings. However, Confucian writings do have numerous references to 'Heaven,' which denotes a transcendent power, with a personal connotation. Neo-Confucian writings, such as that of [[Chu Hsi]], are vague on whether their conception of the Great Ultimate is like a personal deity or not. Also, although the Western translation of the [[Tao]] as 'god' in some editions of the [[Tao te Ching]] is highly misleading, it is still a matter of debate whether the actual descriptions of the [[Tao]] by [[Lao Zi]] has theistic or atheistic undertones.

==Reasons for atheism==
Although not all atheists claim to have a rational justification for their stance, a majority of explicit atheists do assert that their stance has a rational basis, and there are some especially common reasons given by them.

===Philosophical reasons===
A majority of explicit atheists base their stance on rational or philosophical grounds, arguing that their position is based on logical analysis, and subsequent rejection, of theistic claims. These [[existence of God#Arguments_against_the_existence_of_God|arguments against the existence of deities]] consist of a number of different problems with theism. Chief among these problems is a perceived lack of evidence supporting theistic claims.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Within the framework of [[scientific]] [[rationalism]] one arrives at the belief in the nonexistence of God, not because of certain knowledge, but because of a sliding scale of methods. At one extreme, we can confidently rebut the personal Gods of creationists on firm [[empirical]] grounds: science is sufficient to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that there never was a worldwide flood and that the evolutionary sequence of the Cosmos does not follow either of the two versions of Genesis. The more we move toward a deistic and fuzzily defined God, however, the more scientific rationalism reaches into its toolbox and shifts from empirical science to [[logical]] philosophy informed by science. Ultimately, the most convincing arguments against a deistic God are [[Hume's dictum]] and [[Occam's razor]]. These are philosophical arguments, but they also constitute the bedrock of all of science, and cannot therefore be dismissed as non-scientific. The reason we put our trust in these two principles is because their application in the empirical sciences has led to such spectacular successes throughout the last three centuries.&quot; [http://psy.ucsd.edu/~eebbesen/Psych110/SciRelig.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many atheists hold that as their view is merely the absence of a certain belief, the only defense that atheism needs is a good offense. If theism's arguments are refuted, nontheism, as the only alternative, becomes the default position. As such, many atheists have argued against the most famous &quot;proofs&quot; of God's existence for centuries. Whether all of the theistic arguments have been refuted is a matter in dispute.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Throughout the centuries, theistic philosophers have offered logical arguments in support of God's existence. Most of these can be divided into four major classes - ontological, cosmological, teleological, and moral&quot; [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/] &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In general, atheists contend that these have been refuted.

There are also many atheists who attack specific forms of theism as being self-contradictory. One of the most common arguments against the existence of a specific God is the [[problem of evil]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The problem of evil is probably the most enduring and the most potent argument atheism has to offer against many varieties of theism. Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] aptly styled it ''atheism's killer argument''. In brief, it seeks to establish that the existence of evil in the world is logically incompatible with the existence of a benevolent God, and that it is more reasonable to conclude that God does not exist than that he does exist but does nothing to stop evil.&quot; [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/allpossibleworlds.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other well-known positive arguments include [[theological noncognitivism]], [[incoherency argument]]s (which seek to prove contradictions within the nature of &quot;god&quot;), atheistic teleological arguments, and the [[Transcendental argument for the non-existence of God]].

===Personal and social reasons===
As well as atheists with philosophical reasons, there are explicit atheists who cite social, psychological, practical, and other reasons for their beliefs.

Some people hold atheistic beliefs on the grounds that it is conducive towards living a better life, such as the belief that atheism is more ethical or useful than theism. Such atheists may hold that searching for explanations through natural science is more beneficial than doing it through faith.

Moral reasons for atheism include &quot;cases where the requirement to do what is right favors being an atheist, or at the very least, not supporting certain sects or practices of theism.'''...''' Those who cannot accept the notion of an evil god must conclude that any immoral religion is necessarily false.&quot; Practical reasons for atheism include &quot;reasons why accepting atheism over theism produces positive overall effects on a person's life.&quot; [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/necessityofatheism.html]

Arguments that theism promotes immorality often center around the contention that a great deal of violence, including [[war]], has been brought about by religious beliefs and practices.

Some people are atheists at least partly because of growing up in an environment where atheism is relatively common, such as being raised by atheist parents.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Many people are atheists not because they've reasoned things out like that, but because of the way they were brought up or educated, or because they have simply adopted the beliefs of the culture in which they grew up.&quot; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/reasons/index.shtml BBC].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most atheists contend that the same is true for many believers. For instance, most of the population in predominantly Jewish, Muslim, or Christian countries follow the religion that is more prevalent without much questioning. &lt;!-- Cyclic logic. &quot;More people believe in Christianity in places where more people believe in Christianity.&quot; --&gt;

Christian psychologist Paul Vitz (1999) argues that, &quot;Many people have psychological reasons for atheism&quot; [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/frear/vitz.htm] and &quot;neurotic psychological barriers to belief in God are of great importance&quot; [http://www.origins.org/articles/vitz_psychologyofatheism.html]. See Vitz (1999) and, for a similar view, Rizzuto (1998). 

While it is common to point out the psychological reasons for not being an atheist, it is important to note that emotion and &quot;feelings&quot; play an important role for many people, not just theists. However, an understanding of the psychological origins for belief in a god may contribute to some atheists' lack of religious belief; see [[true believer syndrome]] and [[psychology of religion]].

===Historical reasons===
Without even taking into account scientific research, some atheists have come to the conclusion that the existence of one or more gods can be dismissed due to historical reasons. Looking at very old civilizations such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], people believed in multiple gods, linking each of them to an unexplained physical reality, such as [[Hades]] the god of the dead, [[Helios]] the god of the sun, [[Zeus]] the god of thunder and [[Poseidon]] the god of earthquakes. These people could not explain a phenomenon using a [[scientific theory]] and thus invented a god to explain it, from fear of the unexplained.

In our current times, all of these things, except one, have been explained scientifically. There are no significant group of people believing earthquakes are the direct action of a god shaking the [[Earth]]. The only item from the original gods that is still a near complete mystery is death, and as such only one god remains in most modern religions, and looking at the various religions, death (along with afterlife) is usually a central topic.

Looking at [[Historical persecution by Christians|historical records]], one can also see how the fears that people have of unexplained phenomenons have been used by various religious leaders both to persecute other religions, and to gain more believers. It seems likely to some atheists, that if the result of death could someday be explained beyond a reasonable doubt by science, the last god would no longer be worshiped by a majority of people, just as was the case for every previous mythical god.

==Criticisms of atheism==
{{main|Criticism of Atheism}}
Atheists and atheism have received much criticism and opposition, chiefly from theistic sources, throughout human history. Opponents of atheism have frequently associated atheism with immorality and evil, often characterizing it as a willful and malicious rejection of gods. This, in fact, is the original definition and sense of the word, but changing sensibilities and the normalization of nonreligious viewpoints have caused the term to lose its negative connotations, at least in secular cultures.

The most direct arguments against atheism are those in favor of the existence of deities, which would imply that atheism is simply untrue. For examples of this type of argument, see [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|Existence of God]]. 

Many common criticisms of atheism are rooted in a misunderstanding of what it is, or an incorrect assumption that all atheists are &quot;strong&quot; atheists who assert that there is no such thing as God anywhere in the universe. [[Ray Comfort]] exhibits this fallacy in &quot;The Atheist Test&quot; [http://ecclesia.org/truth/atheist.html]: ''&quot;To say 'There is no God,' and to be correct in the statement, I must be omniscient. I must know how many hairs are upon every head, every thought of every human heart, every detail of history, every atom within every rock...nothing is hidden from my eyes...I know the intimate details of the secret love-life of the fleas on the back of the black cat of Napoleon's great-grandmother. To make the absolute statement 'There is no God.' I must have absolute knowledge that there isn't one.&quot;&quot;

Other criticisms of atheism are based in conceptions that it leads to poor morals or ethics, that it is impossible for a person to truly have faith in nothing, or that lack of belief in a god is as much (or more) a leap of faith than belief in a god. These criticisms have been answered to the satisfaction of many atheists. [http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agnosticism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that the [[truth]]  or falsity of certain claims‚Äîparticularly [[theology|theological]] claims regarding the existence of [[Monotheism|God]] or [[Polytheism|gods]]‚Äîis unknown, unknowable, or incoherent. Some agnostics infer from this that these claims are irrelevant to [[Meaning of life|life]]. 

The term and the related ''agnostic'' were coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in [[1869]], and are also used to describe those who are unconvinced or noncommittal about the existence of deities as well as other matters of [[religion]]. The word agnostic comes from the Greek ''a'' (without) and ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge).  Agnosticism, focusing on what can be known, is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position (dealing with the nature and limits of human knowledge); while atheism and theism are [[ontology|ontological]] positions (a branch of metaphysics that deals with what types of entities exist).  Agnosticism is not to be confused with a view specifically opposing the doctrine of [[gnosis]] and [[Gnosticism]]&amp;mdash;these are religious concepts that are not generally related to agnosticism.

Agnosticism is distinct from [[strong atheism]] (also called ''positive atheism'' or ''dogmatic atheism''), which denies the existence of any deities. However, the more general variety of [[atheism]], [[weak atheism]] (also called ''negative atheism'', and sometimes ''neutral atheism''), professes only a lack of belief in a god or gods, which is not equivalent to but is compatible with agnosticism.  ''Critical atheism'' admits that a god or gods are meaningful concepts but the evidence for them is not in hand, so a default position of not believing in them must be taken in the interim.

Agnostics may claim that it isn't possible to have ''absolute'' or ''certain'' spiritual knowledge or, alternatively, that while certainty ''may'' be possible, they personally have no such knowledge. In both cases, agnosticism involves some form of [[philosophical scepticism|skepticism]] towards religious statements.  This is different from the simple [[irreligion]] of those who give no thought to the subject.

==Variations==
Agnosticism has suffered more than most expressions of philosophical position from terminological vagaries. Data collection services [http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Nonreligious], [http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2122.html] often display the common use of the term, distinct from strong atheism in its lack of disputing the existence of deities. Agnostics are listed alongside [[secularism|secular]], [[irreligion|non-religious]], or other such categories.

Other variations include:

* [[Strong agnosticism]] (also called hard agnosticism, closed agnosticism, strict agnosticism, absolute agnosticism)‚Äîthe view that the question of the existence of deities is unknowable by nature or that human beings are ill-equipped to judge the evidence.
* [[Weak agnosticism]] (also called soft agnosticism, open agnosticism, empirical agnosticism, temporal agnosticism)‚Äîthe view that the existence or nonexistence of God or gods is currently unknown but isn't necessarily unknowable, therefore one will withhold judgment until more evidence is available.
* [[Apathetic agnosticism]]‚Äîthe view that there is no proof either of God's existence or nonexistence, but since God (if there is one) appears unconcerned for the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants, the question is largely academic.
* [[Ignosticism]]‚Äîthe view that the concept of God as a being is meaningless because it has no verifiable consequences, therefore it cannot be usefully discussed as having existence or nonexistence. See [[scientific method]].
* Model agnosticism‚Äîthe view that philosophical and metaphysical questions are not ultimately verifiable but that a model of malleable assumption should be built upon rational thought. This branch of agnosticism does not focus on a deity's existence.
* [[Agnostic theism]]‚Äîthe view of those who do not claim to ''know'' God's existence, but still ''believe'' in his existence. (''See [[Epistemology#Knowledge_and_belief|Knowledge Vs Beliefs]]'') Whether this is truly agnosticism is disputed.  It may also imply the belief that although there is something that resembles (or would at least appear to us as) a god (or gods,) there remains doubt over their true nature, motives, or the validity of the claim to be 'God' rather than superior, supernatural being(s).
* [[Agnostic spiritualism]]‚Äîthe view that there may or may not be a god (or gods,) while maintaining a general personal belief in a spiritual aspect of reality, particularly without distinct religious basis, or adherence to any established doctrine or dogma.
* [[Agnostic atheism]]‚Äîthe view that God may or may not exist, but that his non-existence is more likely.  Some agnostic atheists would at least partially base their beliefs on [[Occam's Razor]].

==Some philosophical opinions==
Among the most famous agnostics (in the original sense) have been [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. Some have argued from the works of [[David Hume]], especially ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'', that he was an agnostic, but this remains subject to debate. 

===Thomas Henry Huxley===
Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by Huxley to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the &quot;unconditioned&quot; (Hamilton) and the &quot;unknowable&quot; ([[Herbert Spencer]]). It is important, therefore, to discover Huxley's own views on the matter. Though Huxley began to use the term &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to Charles Kingsley, Huxley discussed his views extensively:

:I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''[[a priori]]'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter. . . .

:It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions. . . .

:That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.

And again, to the same correspondent, [[May 6]], [[1863]]:

:I have never had the least sympathy with the ''a priori'' reasons against [[orthodoxy]], and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and [[infidel]] school. Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the [[Christian]] would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I&amp;mdash;who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds&amp;mdash;have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave (Coll. Ess. v. pp. 237-239) the following account:

:So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of &quot;agnostic.&quot; It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the &quot;gnostic&quot; of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant. To my great satisfaction the term took. 

Huxley's agnosticism is believed to be a natural consequence of the intellectual and philosophical conditions of the [[1860]]s, when clerical intolerance was trying to suppress scientific discoveries which appeared to clash with a literal reading of the [[Book of Genesis]] and other established [[Jewish]] and Christian doctrines. Agnosticism should not, however, be confused with [[natural theology]], [[deism]], [[pantheism]], or other science positive forms of [[theism]].

By way of clarification, Huxley states, &quot;In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable&quot; (Huxley, ''Agnosticism'', 1889). While A. W. Momerie has noted that this is nothing but a definition of [[honesty]], Huxley's usual definition goes beyond mere honesty to  insist that these metaphysical issues are fundamentally unknowable.

===Bertrand Russell===
[[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[pamphlet]], ''Why I Am Not a Christian,'' based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title,  is considered a classic statement of agnosticism. The essay briefly lays out Russell&amp;#8217;s objections to some of the [[arguments for the existence of God]] before discussing his moral objections to Christian teachings. He then calls upon his readers to &quot;stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world,&quot; with a &quot;fearless attitude and a free intelligence.&quot; 

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterised himself as an agnostic. He said:

:The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter. (Collected Papers, Vol 10, p.255) 

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:

:That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can. (p.258) 

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance In The Face Of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:

:As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God.

:On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

In his 1953 essay, ''What Is An Agnostic?'' Russell states: 

:An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.   

However, later in the essay, Russell says:

:I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence.

He didn't say &quot;supreme&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; intelligence: these terms are metaphysically loaded.  

For Russell, then, agnosticism doesn't necessarily assert that it is ''in principle'' impossible to know whether or not there is a God. Moreover, &quot;An Agnostic may think the Christian God as improbable as the Olympians; in that case, he is, for practical purposes, at one with the atheists.&quot;

===Logical positivism===
[[logical positivism|Logical positivists]], such as [[Rudolph Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], are sometimes thought to be agnostic. Using arguments reminiscent of [[Wittgenstein]]&amp;#8217;s famous &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent,&quot; they viewed any talk of god(s) as literally [[nonsense]]. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences could not have a truth value and were deemed to be without meaning. But this includes all utterances about 
god(s), ''even'' those agnostic statements that deny knowledge of God(s) are possible. In ''Language, Truth and Logic'' Ayer explicitly rejects agnosticism on the grounds that an agnostic, despite claiming that knowledge of god(s) are not possible, nevertheless holds that statements about god(s) have meaning. This position, however, is valid only in the case of agnostics who define their agnosticism in this fashion. ''[[Ignosticism|Ignostics]]'' define agnosticism in a manner consistent with the logical positivist view, holding theism to be ''incoherent.''

'''Argon''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]]. It has the symbol '''Ar''' and [[atomic number]] 18. The third [[noble gas]], in group 18, argon makes up about 1% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], making it the most common noble gas on Earth.

== Notable characteristics ==
Argon is 2.5 times as [[solubility|soluble]] in water as [[nitrogen]] which is approximately the same solubility as [[oxygen]]. This highly stable chemical element is colorless and odorless in both its liquid and gaseous forms.
There are few known true chemical compounds that contain argon, which is one of the reasons it was formerly called an inert gas. The creation of argon hydrofluoride (HArF), a highly unstable compound of argon with [[fluorine]], was reported by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 2000, but has not been confirmed as of yet.

Although no ''chemical'' compounds of argon are presently confirmed, argon can form [[clathrates]] with [[water (molecule)|water]] when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules. Theoretical calculations on computers have shown several Argon compounds that should be stable but for which no synthesis routes are currently known.

== Applications ==
It is used in lighting since it will not react with the filament in a [[lightbulb]] even under high temperatures and other cases where diatomic nitrogen is an unsuitable (semi-)[[inert]] gas. Other uses;

*Argon is used as an inert gas shield in many forms of [[welding]], including [[metal inert gas welding|mig]] and [[Tungsten inert gas welding|tig]] (where the &quot;'''I'''&quot; stands for [[inert]]).
*as a non-reactive blanket in the manufacture of [[titanium]] and other reactive elements.
*as a protective atmosphere for growing [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] [[crystal]]s.
*as a gas for use in [[plasma globe | plasma globes]].
*as a gas for use in energy efficient [[window]]s.
*Argon-39 has been used for a number of applications, primarily [[ice core|ice coring]]. It has also been used for [[ground water]] dating.
*[[Cryosurgery]] procedures such as [[cryoablation]] uses liquefied argon to destroy [[cancer]] cells.


Argon is also used in technical [[SCUBA]] diving to inflate the dry suit, because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.

== History ==
Argon ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''argos'' meaning &quot;inactive&quot;) was suspected to be present in air by [[Henry Cavendish]] in [[1785]] but was not discovered until [[1894]] by [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] and Sir [[William Ramsay]].

== Occurrence ==
This gas is isolated through liquid air fractionation since the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] contains only 0.934% volume of argon (1.29% mass). The [[Mars (planet)|Martian]] atmosphere in contrast contains 1.6% of Ar-40 and 5 [[part per million|ppm]] Ar-36. In 2005, the ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Huygens]]'' probe also discovered the presence of Ar-40 on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMHB881Y3E_index_0.html].

== Compounds ==
Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were generally considered to be chemically inert and not able to form compounds. However, since then, scientists have been able to force the heavier noble gases to form compounds. In 2000, the first argon compounds were formed by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]]. By shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, they were able to form argon hydrofluoride (HArF): see http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/noblegases.html in its paragraph starting &quot;''Many recent findings''&quot;. It is stable up to 40¬∞[[kelvin|K]].

== Isotopes ==
The main [[isotope]]s of argon found on Earth are Ar-40, Ar-36, and Ar-38. Naturally occurring [[potassium|K]]-40 with a [[half-life]] of 1.250 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, decays to stable Ar-40 (11.2%) by [[electron capture]] and by [[positron emission]], and also transforms to stable Ca-40 (88.8%) via [[beta decay]]. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s.

In the Earth's atmosphere, Ar-39 is made by [[cosmic ray]] activity, primarily with Ar-40. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through [[neutron capture]] by K-39 or [[alpha decay|alpha emission]] by [[calcium]]. Argon-37 is created from the decay of calcium-40 as a result of subsurface [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosions]]. It has a half-life of 35 days.

'''Arsenic''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''As''' and [[atomic number]] 33. This is a notoriously poisonous [[metalloid]] that has three [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms; yellow, black and grey. Arsenic and its compounds are used as [[pesticides]], [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and various [[alloy]]s.

== Notable characteristics ==
Arsenic is very similar chemically to its predecessor [[phosphorus]], so much so that it will partly substitute for [[phosphorus]] in biochemical reactions and is thus [[poison]]ous. When heated it rapidly [[oxidation|oxidizes]] to [[arsenic trioxide]], which has a garlic odor. Arsenic and some arsenic compounds can also [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublime]] upon heating, converting directly to a gaseous form. Elemental arsenic is found in two solid forms: yellow and gray/metallic, with [[specific gravity|specific gravities]] of 1.97 and 5.73, respectively.

== Applications ==
[[Lead hydrogen arsenate]] has been used, well into the [[20th century]], as an [[insecticide]] on [[fruit tree]]s (resulting in [[neurological damage]] to those working the sprayers), and [[Scheele's Green]] has even been recorded in the [[19th century]] as a [[food dye|coloring agent]] in [[sweets]].  In the last half century, [[monosodium methyl arsenate]] (MSMA), a less toxic organic form of arsenic, has replaced lead arsenate's role in agriculture.

The application of most concern to the general public is probably that of [[wood]] which has been treated with [[chromated copper arsenate]] (&quot;CCA&quot;, or &quot;[[Tanalith]]&quot;, and the vast majority of older &quot;[[lumber#Preservatives|pressure treated]]&quot; wood). CCA timber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the [[20th century]] as a structural, and outdoor [[building material]], where there was a risk of [[rot]], or [[insect]] infestation in untreated timber. Although widespread bans followed the publication of studies which showed low-level leaching from in-situ timbers (such as children's [[playground]] equipment) into surrounding [[soil]], the most serious risk is presented by the burning of CCA timber. Recent years have seen fatal animal poisonings, and serious human poisonings resulting from the ingestion - directly or indirectly - of wood ash from CCA timber (the lethal human dose is approximately 20 grams of ash - roughly a tablespoon). Scrap CCA construction timber continues to be widely burnt through ignorance, in both commercial, and domestic fires. Safe disposal of CCA timber remains patchy, and little practiced, there is concern in some quarters about the widespread [[landfill]] disposal of such timber.

During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds have been used as medicines, including [[arsphenamine]] (by [[Paul Ehrlich]]) and [[arsenic trioxide]] (by Thomas Fowler).
Arsphenamine as well as [[Neosalvarsan]] was indicated for [[syphilis]] and [[trypanosomiasis]], but has been superseded by modern [[antibiotics]].
Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 200 years, but most commonly in the treatment of cancer.  The [[FDA]] in 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]] that is resistant to [[all-trans retinoic acid|ATRA]].{{an|ArsTriChemo}}

But arsenic isn't always good for [[cancer]]. Some studies show that if you use arsenic you have a high risk for cancer.

Copper acetoarsenite was used as a green [[pigment]] known under many different names, including [[Paris Green]] and Emerald Green. It caused numerous [[arsenic poisoning]]s.

Other uses;
* Various [[agriculture|agricultural]] insecticides and poisons.
* [[Gallium arsenide]] is an important [[semiconductor]] material, used in [[integrated circuit]]s. Circuits made using the compound are much faster (but also much more expensive) than those made in [[silicon]]. Unlike silicon it is [[direct bandgap]], and so can be used in [[laser diode]]s and [[LED]]s to directly convert [[electricity]] into [[light]].
* Arsenic trioxide is used in [[Australia]] for treating [[termite]] infestations in houses.
* Also used in [[bronzing]] and [[pyrotechny]].

== History ==
The word ''arsenic'' is borrowed from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ÿ≤ÿ±ŸÜŸäÿÆ ''Zarnikh'' meaning &quot;yellow [[orpiment]]&quot;. ''Zarnikh'' was borrowed by [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''arsenikon''. Arsenic has been known and used in [[Iran|Persia]] and elsewhere since ancient times. As the symptoms of [[arsenic poisoning]] were somewhat ill-defined, it was frequently used for [[murder]] until the advent of the [[Marsh test]], a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the [[Reinsch test]].)  Due to its use by the ruling class to bump each other off and its incredible potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the ''Poison of Kings and the King of Poisons''.

During the Bronze Age, arsenic was often included in the bronze (mostly as an impurity), which made the alloy harder.

[[Albertus Magnus]] is believed to have been the first to isolate the
element in [[1250]]. In [[1649]] [[Johann Schroeder]] published two ways of preparing arsenic.

[[image:arsenic-symbol.png|75px|right|Alchemical symbol for arsenic]]The [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbol for arsenic is shown opposite.

In Victorian times, arsenic was mixed with [[vinegar]] and [[chalk]] and eaten by women to improve the [[complexion]] of their faces, making their skin more fair to show they did not work in the fields.  Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to improve their complexion.

There is a massive epidemic of arsenic poisoning in [[Bangladesh]]{{an|bangladesh}}, where it is estimated that approximately 57 million people are drinking [[groundwater]] with arsenic concentrations elevated above the [[World Health Organization]]'s standard of 50 [[Concentration#.22Parts-per.22 Notation|parts per billion]]. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater due to the anoxic conditions of the subsurface. This groundwater began to be used after western [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s instigated a massive tube [[Water well|well]] drinking-water program in the late [[twentieth century]]. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacterially-contaminated surface waters, but unfortunately failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater.(2) Many other countries in [[Southeast Asia|South East Asia]], such as [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Tibet]], are thought to have geological environments similarly conducive to generation of high-arsenic groundwaters.

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:Native arsenic.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Massive native arsenic]]
[[Arsenopyrite]] also called mispickel ([[iron|Fe]][[sulfur|S]]As) is the most common [[mineral]] from which, on heating, the arsenic sublimes leaving ferrous sulfide. Other arsenic minerals include [[realgar]], [[mimetite]], [[cobaltite]] and [[erythrite]].

The most important compounds of arsenic are [[white arsenic]], its [[arsenic sulfide|sulfide]], [[Paris Green]], [[calcium arsenate]], and [[lead hydrogen arsenate]]. Paris Green, calcium arsenate, and lead arsenate have been used as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[insecticide]]s and [[poison]]s. It is sometimes found native, but usually combined with [[silver]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], [[antimony]], or [[sulfur]].

In addition to the inorganic forms mentioned above, arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment. Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the [[food chain]], are progressively metabolised to a less toxic form of arsenic through a process of [[methylation]].

== Precautions ==

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons. Arsenic kills by [[allosteric inhibition]] of the metabolic [[enzyme]] [[lipothiamide pyrophosphate]], leading to death from multi-system [[organ failure]]. See [[arsenic poisoning]]. Arsenic and its compounds inhibit the , which is an important enzyme of metabolism. The [[post mortem]] reveals brick red colored [[mucosa]], due to severe [[haemorrhage]].  

Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as '''''[[toxic]]''''' and '''''dangerous for the environment''''' in the [[European Union]] under [[directive 67/548/EEC]].
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-001-00-X (arsenic) R23/25-50/53; S1/2-20/21-28-45-60-61 --&gt;
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-002-00-5 (other compounds) pareil --&gt;

The [[IARC]] recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogens]], and the EU lists [[arsenic trioxide]], [[arsenic pentoxide]] and [[arsenate]] salts as category 1 [[carcinogen]]s.

Growing the [[Brake (fern)]] [[Pteris vittata]] will remove arsenic from the soil.

'''Antimony''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Sb''' ([[Latin (language)|L.]] ''Stibium'') and [[atomic number]] 51. A [[metalloid]], antimony has four allotropic forms. The stable form of antimony is a blue-white metal. Yellow and black antimony are unstable non-metals. Antimony is used in flame-proofing, [[paint]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, a wide variety of [[alloy]]s, [[electronics]], and [[rubber]].

== Notable characteristics ==
Antimony in its elemental form is a silvery white, [[brittle]], [[fusibility|fusible]], [[crystal|crystalline]] solid that exhibits poor electrical and heat [[conductivity]] properties and [[vaporize]]s at low [[temperature]]s. A [[metalloid]], antimony resembles a metal in its appearance and physical properties, but does not chemically react as a metal. It is also attacked by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] [[acid]]s and [[halogen]]s. Antimony and some of its alloys expand on cooling.

Estimates of the abundance of antimony in the [[Earth]]'s crust range from 0.2 to 0.5 [[part per million|ppm]].  Antimony is geochemically categorized as a [[chalcophile]], occurring with [[sulfur]] and the [[heavy metals]] [[lead]], [[copper]], and [[silver]].

== Applications ==
Antimony is increasingly being used in the [[semiconductor]] industry in the production of [[diode]]s, [[infrared]] detectors, and [[Hall effect|Hall-effect]] devices. As an [[alloy]], this semi-metal  greatly increases [[lead]]'s hardness and mechanical strength. The most important use of antimony metal is as a hardener in lead for storage batteries. Other uses;
*[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]],
*antifriction alloys,
*type metal,
*small arms and tracer bullets,
*cable sheathing,
*matches,
*medicines,
*plumbing (&quot;lead-free&quot; solder contains 5% Sb),
*main and big-end bearings in [[internal combustion engine]]s (as alloy).
*used in the past to treat [[Schistosomiasis]], nowadays [[Praziquantel]] is universally used.

Antimony compounds in the form of [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, sodium antimonate, and antimony trichloride are used in the making of flame-proofing compounds, [[ceramic]] enamels, [[glass]], [[paint]]s, and [[pottery]]. Antimony trioxide is the most important of the antimony compounds and is primarily used in flame-retardant formulations.  These flame-retardant applications include such markets as children's clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers. Also, antimony sulfide is one of the ingredients of a modern match.

== History ==
Antimony was recognized in antiquity ([[4th_millennium_BC|3000 BC]] or earlier) in various compounds, and it was prized for its fine [[casting]] qualities. It was first reported scientifically by [[Tholden]] in [[1450]], and was known to be a metal by the beginning of the [[17th century]].  The origin of the name &quot;antimony&quot; is not clear; the term may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words &quot;anti&quot; and &quot;monos&quot;, which approximately means &quot;opposed to solitude&quot; as it was thought never to exist in its pure form, or from the [[Egyptian mythology|Pharaonic]] expression &quot;Antos Amun&quot;, which could be translated as &quot;bloom of the god [[Amun]]&quot;.

The natural sulfide of antimony, [[stibnite]], was known and used in Biblical times as [[medicine]] and as a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]].  Stibnite is still used in some developing countries as [[medicine]]. Antimony has been used for the treatment of [[schistosomiasis]]. Antimony attaches itself to [[sulfur]] atoms in certain [[enzyme]]s which are used both by the parasite and human host. Small doses can kill the parasite without causing damage to the patient. Antimony and its compounds are used in several[[ veterinary]] preparations like Anthiomaline or Lithium antimony thiomalate, which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants. Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues, at least in animals. Tartar emetic is another antimony preparation which is used as an anti-schistosomal drug.

The relationship between antimony's modern name and its symbol is complex; the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] name for the cosmetic powder antimony sulfide was borrowed by the [[Greece|Greeks]], which was in turn borrowed by [[Latin]], resulting in ''stibium''.  The chemical pioneer [[J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius]] used an abbreviation of this name for antimony in his writings, and his usage became the standard symbol.

Treatments chiefly involving antimony have been called [[antimonial]]s.

[[Image:Antimony massive.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Native massive antimony with [[redox|oxidation]] products]]
Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 [[mineral]] species. Antimony is sometimes found native, but more frequently it is found in the sulfide [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is the predominant ore [[mineral]]. Commercial forms of antimony are generally ingots, broken pieces, granules, and cast cake. Other forms are powder, shot, and single crystals.

== Precautions ==
Antimony and many of its compounds are [[toxic]]. Clinically, antimony poisoning is very similar to [[arsenic]] poisoning. In small doses, antimony causes [[headache]], [[dizziness]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Such small doses have in the past been reported in some acidic fruit drinks. The acidic nature of the drink is sufficient to dissolve small amounts of antimony oxide contained in the packaging of the drink; modern manufacturing methods prevent this occurrence. Larger doses cause violent and frequent vomiting, and will lead to death in few days.  Very large doses will cause violent vomiting, causing the poison to be expelled from the body before any harm is done.

'''Actinium''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol Ac and [[atomic number]] 89.

==Notable characteristics==
Actinium is a silvery radioactive metallic element. Due to its intense radioactivity, Actinium glows in the dark with an eerie blue light. It is found only in traces in uranium ores as 227-Ac, an [[alpha radiation|&amp;alpha;]] and [[beta radiation|&amp;beta; emitter]] with a [[half-life]] of 21.773 years. One ton of [[uranium]] ore contains about a tenth of a gram of actinium.

==Applications==
It is about 150 times as radioactive as radium, making it valuable as a [[neutron source]]. Otherwise it has no significant industrial applications.

Actinium-225 is used in medicine to produce Bi-213 in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radio-immunotherapy.

==History==
Actinium was discovered in [[1899]] by [[Andr√©-Louis Debierne]], a French chemist, who separated it from [[uraninite|pitchblende]]. [[Friedrich Otto Giesel]] independently discovered actinium in [[1902]]. The chemical behavior of actinium is similar to that of the rare earth [[lanthanum]].

The word actinium comes from the Greek ''aktis, aktinos'', meaning beam or ray.

==Occurrence==
Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ore, but more commonly is made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of 226-Ra in a nuclear reactor. Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300¬∫C.

==Isotopes==
Naturally occurring actinium is composed of 1 radioactive [[isotope]]; &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac. 36 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being 227-Ac with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 [[years|y]], 225-Ac with a half-life of 10.0 [[day]]s, and 226-Ac with a half-life of 29.37 [[hours|h]].  All of the remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 10 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. The shortest-lived isotope of actinium is&lt;sup&gt;217&lt;/sup&gt;Ac which decays through [[alpha decay]] and [[electron capture]]. It has a half-life of 69 [[nanoseconds|ns]]. Actinium also has 2 [[meta state]]s.

Purified actinium-227 comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days, and then decays according to its 21.773-year half-life.

The isotopes of actinium range in [[atomic weight]] from 206 [[atomic mass unit|amu]] (&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;actinium) to 236 amu (&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Ac).

==Precautions==
Actinium-227 is extremely radioactive, and in terms of its potential for radiation induced health effects, actinium-227 is about as dangerous as plutonium. Ingesting even small amounts of actinium-227 would present a serious health hazard.

'''Americium''' is a [[synthetic element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol Am and [[atomic number]] 95. A [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[metal]]lic element, americium is an [[actinide]] that was obtained by bombarding [[plutonium]] with [[neutron]]s and was the fourth [[transuranic element]] to be discovered. It was named for the [[The Americas|America]]s, by analogy with [[europium]].

== Notable characteristics ==
Freshly prepared americium [[metal]] has a white and silvery [[luster]], at [[room temperature]]s it slowly tarnishes in dry air. It is more silvery than [[plutonium]] or [[neptunium]] and apparently more malleable than neptunium or [[uranium]]. [[Alpha emission]] from Am-241 is approximately three times [[radium]].  [[Gram]] quantities of Am-241 emit intense [[gamma ray]]s which creates a serious exposure problem for anyone handling the element.

== Applications ==
This element can be produced in [[kilogram]] amounts and has some uses (mostly Am-241 since it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope). Americium has found its way into the household, where one type of [[smoke detector]] contains a tiny amount of Am-241 as a source of [[ionizing radiation]]. Am-241 has been used as a portable gamma ray source for use in [[radiography]]. The element has also been employed to gauge [[glass]] thickness to help create flat glass.  Am-242 is a neutron emitter and has found uses in [[neutron radiography]].  However this isotope is extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities.

== History ==
Americium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized]] by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]] in late [[1944]] at the wartime Metallurgical Laboratory at the [[University of Chicago]] (now known as [[Argonne National Laboratory]]). The team created the [[isotope]] Am-241 by subjecting [[plutonium]]-239 to successive [[neutron capture]] reactions in a [[nuclear reactor]]. This created Pu-240 and then Pu-241 which in turn decayed into Am-241 via [[beta decay]].  Seaborg was granted [[patent]] 3,156,523 for &quot;Element 95 and Method of Producing Said Element&quot;. The discovery of americium and [[curium]] was first announced informally on a children's quiz show in 1945. [http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/print/americiumprint.html]

== Isotopes ==
18 [[radioisotope]]s of americium have been characterized, with the most stable being Am-243 with a [[half-life]] of 7370 years, and Am-241 with a half-life of 432.2 years. All of the remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 51 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 100 minutes. This element also has 8 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being Am-242m (t&lt;sub&gt;¬Ω&lt;/sub&gt; 141 years). The isotopes of americium range in [[atomic weight]] from 231.046 [[atomic mass unit|amu]] (Am-231) to 249.078 amu (Am-249).

== Chemistry ==

In aqueous systems the most common oxidation state is +3, it is very much harder to oxidise Am(III) to Am(IV) than it is to do the same oxidation for Pu(III).

Currently the [[solvent extraction]] chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world [[scientists]] are working on reducing the medium term [[radiotoxicity]] of the waste from the reprocessing of used [[nuclear fuel]].

See [[liquid-liquid extraction]] for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium.


Americium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide americyl core (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[http://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00818038.pdf].  In the environment, this americyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moeities (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.

*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Astatine''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''At''' and [[atomic number]] 85. This [[radioactive]] element occurs naturally from [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] decay and is the heaviest of the [[halogen]]s.

== Notable characteristics ==
This highly [[radioactive]] element has been confirmed by [[mass spectrometer]]s to behave chemically much like other [[halogen]]s, especially [[iodine]] (it would probably accumulate in the [[thyroid]] gland like iodine). Astatine is thought to be more [[metal]]lic than iodine. Researchers at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] have performed experiments that have identified and measured elementary reactions that involve astatine.

With the possible exception of [[francium]], astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element with the total amount in Earth's crust estimated to be less than 1 [[ounce|oz]] (28 g) at any one time; this amounts to less than one teaspoon of the element. The [[Guinness Book of Records]], however, has dubbed the element the rarest on Earth, stating: &quot;Only around 0.9 oz (25 [[gram|g]]) of the element astatine (At) occurs naturally in the Earth's crust.&quot;

== History ==
Astatine ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''astatos'' meaning &quot;unstable&quot;) was first synthesized in [[1940]] by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[K. R. MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segr√®]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by barraging [[bismuth]] with [[alpha particle]]s. An earlier name for the element was ''alabamine'' (Ab).

== Occurrence ==
Astatine is produced by bombarding bismuth with energetic alpha particles to obtain relatively long-lived At-209 - At-211, which can then be [[distillation|distilled]] from the target by heating in the presence of air.

== Isotopes ==
Astatine has 41 known [[isotope]]s, all of which are [[radioactive]]; the longest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;At which has a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. The shortest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;At which has a half-life of 125 [[nanoseconds]].

In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], an '''atom''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''&amp;#940;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#956;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;'' meaning &quot;indivisible&quot;) is the smallest possible particle of a [[chemical element]] that retains its chemical properties. The word ''atom'' may also refer to the smallest possible indivisible [[fundamental particle]]. This definition must not be confused with that of chemical atoms, since chemical atoms (hereafter &quot;atoms&quot;) are composed of smaller [[subatomic particle]]s.

Most atoms are composed of three types of [[subatomic particle]]s which govern their external properties:
* [[electron]]s, which have a negative [[electric charge|charge]] and are the least massive of the three;
* [[proton]]s, which have a positive [[electric charge|charge]] and are about 1836 times more massive than electrons; and
* [[neutron]]s, which have no [[electric charge|charge]] and are about 1838 times more massive than electrons.

Protons and neutrons are both [[nucleon]]s and make up the dense, massive [[atomic nucleus]]. The electrons form the much larger [[electron cloud]] surrounding the nucleus.

Atoms differ in the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain. The number of protons in an atom (called the [[atomic number]]) determines the [[chemical element|element]] of the atom. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may also vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ions]]. The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus may also change, via [[nuclear fusion]], [[nuclear fission]] or [[radioactive decay]].

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of [[chemistry]], and are [[Law of Conservation of Matter|conserved]] in [[chemical reaction]]s. Atoms are able to [[chemical bond|bond]] into [[molecule]]s and other types of [[chemical compound]]s. Molecules are made up of multiple atoms; for example, a molecule of [[water]] is a combination of two [[hydrogen]] atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom.

==Properties of the atom==
===Subatomic particles===
:''see main article [[subatomic particle]]s

Although the name &quot;atom&quot; was applied at a time when atoms were thought to be indivisible, it is now known that the atom can be broken down into a number of smaller components. The first of these to be discovered was the negatively charged [[electron]], which is easily ejected from atoms during [[ionization]]. The electrons orbit a small, dense body containing all of the positive charge in the atom, called the [[atomic nucleus]]. This nucleus is itself made up of [[nucleon]]s: positively charged [[proton]]s and chargeless [[neutron]]s.

Before 1961, the subatomic particles were thought to consist of only protons, neutrons and electrons. However, protons and neutrons themselves are now known to consist of still smaller particles called [[quark]]s. In addition, the electron is known to have a nearly massless neutral partner called a [[neutrino]]. Together, the electron and neutrino are both [[lepton]]s.

Ordinary atoms are composed only of quarks and leptons of the first [[generation (particle physics)|generation]]. The proton is composed of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], whereas the neutron is composed of one up quark and two down quarks. Although they do not occur in ordinary matter, two other heavier generations of quarks and leptons may be generated in [[high-energy physics|high-energy collisions]].

The subatomic [[force carrier|force carrying]] particles (called [[gauge boson]]s) are also important to atoms. Electrons are bound to the nucleus by [[photon]]s carrying the [[electromagnetic force]]. Protons and neutrons are bound together in the nucleus by [[gluon]]s carrying the [[strong nuclear force]].

====Electron configuration====
:''see main article [[electron configuration]]''

The [[chemistry|chemical behavior]] of atoms is due to interactions between electrons. Electrons of an atom remain within certain, predictable [[electron configurations]]. These configurations are determined by the [[quantum mechanics]] of electrons in the [[electric potential]] of the atom; the [[principal quantum number]] determines particular [[electron shell]]s with distinct [[energy level]]s. Generally, the higher the energy level of a shell, the further away it is from the nucleus. The electrons in the outermost shell, called the [[valence electron]]s, have the greatest influence on chemical behavior. Core electrons (those not in the outer shell) play a role, but it is usually in terms of a secondary effect due to screening of the positive charge in the atomic nucleus.

[[Image:HAtomOrbitals.png|frame|right|The [[atomic orbital]] [[wavefunction]]s of a [[hydrogen atom]]. The [[principal quantum number]] is at the right of each row and the [[azimuthal quantum number]] is denoted by letter at top of each column.]]

An electron shell can hold up to 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons, where ''n'' is the principal quantum number of the shell. The occupied shell of greatest ''n'' is the valence shell, even if it only has one electron. In the most stable [[ground state]], an atom's electrons will fill up its shells in order of increasing energy. Under some circumstances an electron may be [[excited state|excited]] to a higher energy level (that is, it absorbs energy from an external source and leaps to a higher shell), leaving a space in a lower shell. An excited atom's electrons will [[spontaneous emission|spontaneously fall]] into lower levels, emitting excess energy as a [[photon]]s, until it returns to the ground state.

In addition to its principal quantum number ''n'', an electron is distinguished by three other quantum numbers: the [[azimuthal quantum number]] ''l'' (describing the [[orbital angular momentum]] of the electron), the [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m'' (describing the direction of the angular momentum vector), and the [[spin quantum number]] ''s'' (describing the direction of the electron's [[spin (physics)|intrinsic angular momentum]]). Electrons with varying ''l'' and ''m'' have distinctive shapes denoted by [[spectroscopic notation]]. In the illustration, the letters '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' (corresponding to ''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3) describe the shape of the [[atomic orbital]]. In most atoms, orbitals of differing ''l'' are not exactly [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]] but separated into a [[fine structure]]. Orbitals of differing ''m'' are degenerate but may be separated by applying a [[magnetic field]], creating the [[Zeeman effect]]. Electrons with differing ''s'' have very slight energy differences called [[hyperfine splitting]].

====Nucleon properties====

The constituent [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s of the [[atomic nucleus]] are collectively called [[nucleon]]s. The nucleons are held together in the nucleus by the [[strong nuclear force]].

Nuclei can undergo transformations that affect the number of protons and neutrons they contain, a process called [[radioactive decay]]. When nuclei transformations take place spontaneously, this process is called [[radioactivity]]. Radioactive transformations proceed by a wide variety of modes, but the most common are [[alpha decay]] (emission of a [[helium]] nucleus) and [[beta decay]] (emission of an electron). Decays involving electrons or [[positron]]s are due to the [[weak nuclear interaction]].

In addition, like the electrons of the atom, the nucleons of nuclei may be pushed into [[excited state]]s of higher energy. However, these transitions typically require thousands of times more energy than electron excitations. When an excited nucleus emits a photon to return to the [[ground state]], the photon has very high energy and is called a [[gamma ray]].

Nuclear transformations also take place in [[nuclear reaction]]s. In [[nuclear fusion]], two light nuclei come together and merge into a single heavier nucleus. In [[nuclear fission]], a single large nucleus is divided into two or more smaller nuclei.

===Atom size and speed===
Atoms are much smaller than the [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] that human vision can detect, so atoms cannot be seen in any kind of optical [[microscope]]. However, there are ways of detecting the positions of atoms on the surface of a solid or a [[thin film]] so as to obtain images. These include: [[electron microscope]]s (such as in [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM)), [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM), [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[x-ray microscopy]].

Since the [[electron cloud]] does not have a sharp cutoff, the size of an atom is not easily defined. For atoms that can form solid [[crystal]] [[crystal lattice|lattice]]s, the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms can be easily determined by [[x-ray diffraction]], giving an estimate of the atoms' size. For any atom, one might use the radius at which the electrons of the [[valence shell]] are most likely to be found. As an example, the size of a [[hydrogen]] atom is estimated to be approximately 1.0586&amp;times;10{{smsup|‚àí10}}&amp;nbsp;m (twice the [[Bohr radius]]). Compare this to the size of the [[proton]] (the only particle in the nucleus of the hydrogen atom), which is approximately 10{{smsup|‚àí15}}&amp;nbsp;m. So the ratio of the size of the hydrogen atom to its nucleus is about 100,000:1.  If an atom were the size of a [[stadium]], the nucleus would be the size of a [[marbles|marble]]. Nearly all the mass of an atom is in its nucleus, yet almost all the space in an atom is filled by its electrons.

Atoms of different [[chemical element|elements]] do vary in size, but the sizes do not scale linearly with the mass of the atom. Their sizes are roughly the same to within a factor of 2. The reason for this is that heavy elements have large positive charge on their nuclei, which strongly attract the electrons to the center of the atom. This contracts the size of the [[electron shell]]s, so that more electrons fit in the only a slightly greater volume.
  
The [[temperature]] of a collection of atoms is a measure of the average energy of motion of those atoms; at 0 [[kelvin]]s ([[absolute zero]]) atoms would have no motion. As the temperature of the system is increased, the kinetic energy of the particles in the system is increased, and their speed of motion increases. At [[room temperature]], atoms making up gases in the air move at a speed of 500&amp;nbsp;m/s (about 1100 mph or 1800 km/h).

===Elements, isotopes and ions===

Atoms are generally classified by their [[atomic number]] ''Z'', which corresponds to the number of protons in the atom. The atomic number determines which [[chemical element]] the atom is. For example, [[carbon]] atoms are atoms containing six protons. All atoms with the same atomic number share a wide variety of physical properties and exhibit the same [[chemical properties]]. The elements may be sorted according to the [[periodic table]] in order of increasing atomic number.

The [[atomic mass]] ''A'', atomic mass number, or nucleon number of an element is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom of that element, so-called because each proton and neutron has a mass of about 1&amp;nbsp;[[amu]]. The number of neutrons ''A''‚àí''Z'' in an atom has no effect on which element it is. Each element can have numerous kinds of atoms with the same number of protons and electrons but varying numbers of neutrons. Each has the same atomic number but a different mass number. These are called the [[isotope]]s of an element. When writing the name of an isotope, the element name is followed by the mass number. For example, [[carbon-14]] contains 6 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom, for a total mass number of 14.

The atomic mass listed for each element in the periodic table is an average of the isotope masses found in nature, [[weighted average|weighted]] by their [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]].

The simplest atom is the [[hydrogen]] isotope [[protium]], which has atomic number 1 and atomic mass number 1; it consists of one proton and one electron. The hydrogen isotope which also contains one neutron so is called [[deuterium]] or hydrogen-2; the hydrogen isotope with two neutrons is called [[tritium]] or hydrogen-3. Tritium is an unstable isotope which decays through a process called [[radioactivity]]. Almost all isotopes of each element are radioactive; only a few are [[stable isotope|stable]]. The elements with atomic number 84 ([[polonium]]) and heavier have no stable isotopes and are all radioactive.

Virtually all elements heavier than hydrogen and [[helium]] were created through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. Most of the elements lighter than [[uranium]] (''Z''=92) have stable-enough isotopes to occur naturally on [[Earth]] (with the notable exception of [[technetium]] ''Z''=43). Several elements that do not occur on Earth have been found to be present in [[star]]s. Elements not normally found in nature have been artificially created by [[synthetic element|nuclear bombardment]]; [[as of 2006]], elements have been created through atomic number 116 (given the temporary name [[ununhexium]]). These ultra-heavy elements are generally highly unstable and decay quickly.

Atoms that have either lost or gained electrons are called atomic [[ion]]s (with either positive(+) or negative charge(‚àí), respectively).

===Valence and bonding===
:''see main article [[valence electron]]s and [[chemical bond]]''

The number of electrons in an atom's outermost shell (the [[valence shell]]) governs its bonding behavior. Therefore, elements with the same number of valence electrons are [[periodic table group|group]]ed together in the columns of the [[periodic table]] of the elements. [[Alkali metal]]s contain one electron on their outer shell; [[alkaline earth metal]]s, two electrons; [[halogen]]s, seven electrons; and various others. 

Every atom is most stable with a full valence shell. This means that atoms with full valence shells (the [[noble gas]]es) are very unreactive. Conversely, atoms with few electrons in their valence shell are more [[reactivity|reactive]] it is. Alkali metals are therefore very reactive, with [[caesium]], [[rubidium]], and [[francium]] being the most reactive of all metals. Also, atoms that need only few electrons (such as the halogens) to fill their valence shells are reactive. [[Fluorine]] is the most reactive of all elements.

Atoms may fill their valence shells by [[chemical bond]]ing. This can be achieved one of two ways: an atom can either share electrons with other atoms (a ''[[covalent bond]]''), or it can remove electrons from (or donate electrons to) other atoms (an ''[[ionic bond]]''). The formation of a bond causes a strong attraction between two atoms, creating [[molecule]]s or [[ionic compound]]s. Many other types of bonds exist, including:
*[[polar covalent bond]]s;
*[[coordinate covalent bond]]s;
*[[metallic bond]]s;
*[[hydrogen bond]]s; and
*[[van der Waals bond]]s.

===Atomic spectrum===
:''see main article [[Atomic spectroscopy]]''

Since each element in the [[periodic table]] consists of an atom in a unique configuration with different numbers of [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s, each element can also be uniquely described by the [[energy level|energies]] of its [[atomic orbital]]s and the number of electrons within them. Normally, an atom is found in its lowest-energy [[ground state]]; states with higher energy are called [[excited state]]s. An electron may move from a lower-energy orbital to a higher-energy orbital by absorbing a [[photon]] with energy equal to the difference between the energies of the two levels. An electron in a higher-energy orbital may drop to a lower-energy orbital by emitting a photon. Since each element has a unique set of energy levels, each creates its own [[light]] pattern unique to itself: its own spectral signature.  

If a set of atoms is heated (such as in an [[arc lamp]]), their electrons will move into excited states. When these atoms fall back toward the ground state, they will produce an [[emission spectrum]]. If a set of atoms is illuminated by a [[continuous spectrum]], it will only absorb specific [[wavelength]]s (energies) of photon that correspond to the differences in its energy levels. The resulting pattern of gaps is called the [[absorption spectrum]].

In spectroscopic analysis, scientists can use a [[spectrometer]] to study the atoms in [[star]]s and other distant objects. Due to the distinctive spectral lines that each element produces, they are able to tell the chemical composition of distant [[planet]]s, stars and [[nebula]]e.

Not all parts of the atomic spectrum are in visible light part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. For example, the [[hyperfine transition]]s (including the important [[21 cm line]]) produce low-energy [[radio wave]]s. When electrons deep inside large atoms are knocked out (for example by [[beta radiation]]), replacement atoms fall deep into the [[electric potential]] of the [[nucleus]], producing high-energy [[x-ray]]s.

==Atoms and antimatter==
:''see main article [[antimatter]]

[[Antimatter]] can also form atoms, composed of [[positron]]s, antiprotons, and antineutrons. Since antimatter is very difficult to produce and store, only a small amount [[antihydrogen]] has ever existed on Earth. This was produced at [[CERN]] in the [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]] experiments using the [[Antiproton Decelerator]].

==Atoms and the Big Bang==

In models of the [[Big Bang]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts that within one to three minutes of the Big Bang almost all atomic material in the universe was created. During this process, [[nucleus|nuclei]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] formed abundantly, but almost no elements heavier than [[lithium]]. Hydrogen makes up approximately 75% of the atoms in the universe; helium makes up 24%; and all other elements make up just 1%. However, although nuclei (fully-[[ion]]ized atoms) were created, neutral atoms themselves could not form in the intense heat.

Big Bang chronology of the atom continues to approximately 379,000 years after the Big Bang when the cosmic temperature had dropped to just 3,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]]. It was then cool enough to allow the nuclei to capture [[electron]]s. This process is called [[recombination]], during which the first neutral atoms took form. Once atoms become neutral, they only absorb [[photon]]s of a discrete [[absorption spectrum]]. This allows most of the photons in the universe to travel unimpeded for billions of years. These photons are still detectable today in the [[cosmic microwave background]].

After Big Bang nucleosynthesis, no heavier elements could be created until the [[star formation|formation of the first stars]]. These stars [[nuclear fusion|fused]] heavier elements through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] during their lives and through [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] as they died. The seeding of the [[interstellar medium]] by heavy elements eventually allowed the formation of [[terrestrial planet]]s like the [[Earth]].

==History of atomic theory==
{{main|Atomic theory}}

===Early atomism===
From the [[6th century BC]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]]a philosophers in [[ancient India]] developed the earliest atomic theories. The first philosopher who formulated ideas about the atom in a systematic manner was [[Kanada]] who lived in the 6th century BC. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayana who also lived in the 6th century BC and was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]], had also propounded ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world. Indian atomists believed that an atom could be one of upto six elements, with each element having upto 24 properties. They developed detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, and had particularly elaborate theories of how atoms combine, which explains how atoms first combine in pairs, and then group into trios of pairs, which are the smallest visible units of matter. This parallels with the structure of modern atomic theory, in which pairs or triplets of supposedly fundamental quarks combine to create most typical forms of matter. They had also suggested the possibility of splitting an atom which, as we know today, is the source of atomic energy. (See [[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]] for more details.)

[[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]], [[Greek philosophers]] in the [[5th century BC]], presented a theory of atoms. (See [[Atomism]] for more details.) The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes, which determined the physical properties of the material.  For instance, the atoms of a [[liquid]] were thought to be smooth, allowing them to slide over each other. None of these ideas, however, were founded in [[scientific method|scientific experimentation]].

During the [[Middle Ages]] (the [[Islamic Golden Age]]), [[Islam]]ic atomists develop atomic theories that represent a synthesis of both Greek and Indian atomism. (See [[Atomism|Islamic atomism]] for more details.) Older Greek and Indian ideas were further developed by Islamic atomists, along with new Islamic ideas, such as the possibility of there being particles smaller than an atom. As Islamic influence began spreading through Europe, the ideas of Islamic atomism, along with the older ideas of Greek and Indian atomism, spread throughout Europe by the end of the Middle Ages, where modern atomic theories began taking shape.

===Birth of modern atomic theory===

In 1808, [[John Dalton]] proposed that an [[element]] is composed of atoms of a single, unique type, and that although their shape and structure was immutable, atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ([[chemical compound]]s). He deduced this after the experimental discovery of the [[law of multiple proportions]] ‚Äî that is, if two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small [[whole number]]s.

The experiment in question involved combining [[nitrous oxide]] (NO) with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In one combination, these gases formed [[dinitrogen trioxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but when he repeated the combination with double the amount of oxygen (a ratio of 1:2), they instead formed [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

4NO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

4NO + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 4NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Atomic theory conflicted with the theory of [[infinite divisibility]], which states that [[matter]] can always be divided into smaller parts. In 1827, biologist [[Robert Brown]] observed that pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] theorised that this [[Brownian motion]] was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a mathematical theory around it. This theory was validated experimentally in 1911 by French physicist [[Jean Perrin]].

===Discovery of subatomic particles===

For much of this time, atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter. However, in 1897, [[J.J. Thomson]] published his work proving that [[cathode ray]]s are made of negatively charged particles ([[electron]]s). Since cathode rays are emitted from matter, this proved that atoms are made up of [[subatomic particles]] and are therefore divisible, and not the indivisible ''atomos'' postulated by [[Democritus]]. Physicists later invented a new term for such indivisible units, &quot;[[elementary particle]]s&quot;, since the word atom had come into its common modern use.

===Study of atomic structure===

At first, it was believed that the electrons were distributed more or less uniformly in a sea of positive charge (the [[plum pudding model]]). However, an experiment conducted in 1909 by colleagues of [[Ernest Rutherford]] demonstrated that atoms have a most of their mass and positive charge concentrated in a [[nucleus]]. In the [[gold foil experiment]], [[alpha particle]]s (emitted by [[polonium]]) were shot through a sheet of [[gold]]. Rutherford observed that most of the particles passed straight through the sheet with little deflection (striking a [[fluorescence|fluorescent screen]] on the other side). About 1 in 8000 of the alpha particles, however, were heavily deflected (by more than 90 degrees). This led to the planetary model of the atom in which pointlike electrons orbited in the space around a massive compact nucleus like planets orbiting the Sun.

The nucleus was later discovered to contain [[proton]]s, and further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms surpassed that of the protons it possessed; this led him to postulate the existence of [[neutron]]s, whose existence would be proven in 1932 by [[James Chadwick]].

The planetary model of the atom still had shortcomings. Firstly, a moving [[electric charge]] emits [[electromagnetic wave]]s; according to [[classical electromagnetism]], an orbiting charge would steadily lose energy and spiral towards the nucleus, colliding with it in a tiny fraction of a second. Secondly, the model did not explain why excited atoms emit light only in certain [[emission spectrum|discrete spectra]].  

[[Quantum theory]] revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century when [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in fixed amounts known as [[quanta]]. In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] used this idea in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom, in which the electrons could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed [[angular momentum]] and energy. They were not allowed to spiral into the nucleus, because they could not lose energy in a continuous manner; they could only make [[quantum leap]]s between fixed [[energy level]]s. Bohr's model was extended by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] in 1916 to include elliptical orbits, using a quantization of [[generalized momentum]].

The ad hoc Bohr-Sommerfeld model was extremely difficult to use, but it made impressive predictions in agreement with certain spectral properties. However, the model was unable to explain multielectron atoms, predict [[transition rate]]s or describe [[fine structure|fine]] and [[hyperfine structure]]. In 1925, [[Erwin Schr√∂dinger]] developed a full theory of quantum mechanics, described by the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]]. Together with [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]], this allowed study of atoms with great precision when digital computers became available. Even today, these theories are used in the [[Hartree-Fock]] [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] method to determine the energy levels of atoms. Further refinements of quantum theory such as the [[Dirac equation]] and [[quantum field theory]] made smaller impacts on the theory of atoms.

Another model of historical interest, proposed by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1916, had [[cubical atom]]s with electrons statically held at the corners. The cubes could share edges or faces to form chemical bonds. This model was created to account for chemical phenomena such as bonding, rather than physical phenomena such as atomic spectra.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:040719_172_dorset_marnhull.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern arable agriculture typically uses large [[field (agriculture)|fields]] like this one in [[Dorset]], [[England]].]]
In [[geography]], '''arable land''' (from [[Latin]] ''arare'', to [[plough]] ) is a form of [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[land use]], meaning [[land (economics)|land]] that can be (and is) used for growing [[agriculture|crops]].  [[David Ricardo]] incorporated the idea of arable land into [[economic]] [[theory]].

Of the earth's 57 million square miles (148,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;) of land, more than 12 million square miles (31,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;) are arable. 

Most of the arable land on earth is around the largest rivers on earth. Some examples are: the [[Nile]] River, the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers, the [[Yellow River]], the [[Amazon River]], the [[Ganges]] and the [[Rhine]] River. These rivers flood regularly, overspilling their banks. When the flood is over, the rivers recede, leaving behind rich [[silt]]. This silt is excellent fertilizer for [[crops]]. Even if the land is overfarmed, and all the [[nutrient]]s are depleted from the soil, the land renews its fertility when the next flood comes. Rivers and streams can make desert land arable. 

==Unarable land==

On unarable land, farming is nearly impossible unless more advanced methods of [[agriculture]] are used. Unarable land usually has no source of fresh water, and is often too hot (desert), too cold (arctic), too rocky, too mountainous, too salty, too rainy, too snowy, or too cloudy. Clouds block the sunlight plants need for [[photosynthesis]] (making sunlight into food). The plants starve without light. [[Starvation]] and [[nomad]]ism often exist on unarable land. Unarable land is sometimes called 'wastes', 'badlands', 'worthless' or 'no man's land'.

Sometimes, unarable land can be turned into arable land. New arable land makes more food, and can prevent [[starvation]], saving lives. This also makes the country more [[self-sufficient]] and politically independent, because the country doesn't have to buy food from other countries. Making unarable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells, aquaducts, [[desalination]] plants, planting trees for shade in the desert, [[hydroponic]]s, fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, [[pesticide]]s, [[reverse osmosis]] water processors, [[mylar]] insulation or other insulation against heat and cold, digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind, and greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas.

Some examples of infertile '''unarable''' land being turned into fertile '''arable''' land are: 
* Aran Island: This island off the west coast of Ireland, (not to be confused with the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]]'s [[Firth of Clyde]]), was unarable because it was too rocky. The people covered the island with a shallow layer of seaweed and sand from the ocean. This made it arable. Today, they grow crops there.
* [[Israel]]: Israel was mostly unarable desert until [[desalination]] plants were built on the coast. The plants turn salt water into fresh water for farming, drinking, and washing. They created their own large fresh water source.

Some examples of fertile '''arable''' land being turned into infertile '''unarable''' land are: 
* Droughts like the '[[dust bowl]]' of the [[Great Depression]] in the U.S. turned farmland into desert. 
* [[Rainforest]] Deforestation: The fertile tropical forests turn into infertile desert land.
* [[Roman Republic|Roman]]s' destruction of [[Carthage]]: At the end of the [[Punic War]]s, the victorious Romans sowed the earth with salt, to symbolize total victory. The Roman symbol meant that Carthage would never grow back - their civilization ended. Crops won't generally grow in salty soil. This is why salt water from the ocean can't be used to water crops. 
* Each year more arable land is lost to desertification and [[erosion]] from human industrial activities. Irrigation of farm land also increases the [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] in the soil. This process steadily concentrates salt in the ground, decreasing productivity for crops that are not salt-tolerant.
* [[Urban sprawl]]: In the United States, about 2.2 million acres (8,900 km¬≤) of land was added to urban areas between 1992 and 2002, much of it farm land now paved.

'''Aluminium''' or '''aluminum''' (see the [[#Spelling|spelling]] section below) is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol '''Al''' and atomic number 13.  It is a silvery and ductile member of the [[poor metal]] group of [[chemical element]]s. Aluminium is found primarily as the ore [[bauxite]] and is remarkable for its resistance to corrosion (due to the phenomenon of [[passivation]]) and its light weight. Aluminium is used in many industries to make millions of different products and is very important to the [[world economy]]. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry and very important in other areas of [[transport]]ation and building in which light weight, durability, and strength are needed.

==Properties==
[[Image:Aluminum_Metal.jpg|thumb|left|A piece of aluminium metal about 15 centimetres long.]]
Aluminium is a soft and lightweight metal with a dull silvery appearance, due to a thin layer of [[oxidation]] that forms quickly when it is exposed to air. Aluminium is nontoxic (as the metal), non-magnetic, and non-sparking. Pure aluminium has a tensile strength of about 49 megapascals (MPa) and 400 MPa if it is formed into an alloy. Aluminium is about one-third as dense as [[steel]] or [[copper]]; is [[Malleability|malleable]], [[Ductility|ductile]], and easily machined and cast; and has excellent [[corrosion]] resistance and durability due to the protective oxide layer. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200-400 nm (UV) , and the 3000-10000 nm (far IR) regions, while in the 400-700 nm visible range it is slightly outdone by [[silver]], and in the 700-3000 (near IR) by silver, [[gold]] and copper. It is the second most malleable metal (after gold) and the sixth most [[ductile]]. Aluminium is a good heat [[conductor]] which is why it is used to make saucepans.
[[Image:Bohr2.gif|thumb|Caption|[[Bohr]] Diagram.]]

==Applications==
Whether measured in terms of quantity or value, the use of aluminium exceeds that of any other metal except [[iron]], and it is important in virtually all segments of the world economy.

Pure aluminium has a low [[tensile strength]], but readily forms [[alloy]]s with many elements such as copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese and silicon (e.g.[[duralumin]]). Today almost all materials that claim to be aluminium are actually an alloy thereof. Pure aluminium is encountered only when corrosion resistance is more important than strength or hardness. Conversely, the term &quot;alloy&quot; in general use today usually means aluminium alloy.

When combined with thermo-mechanical processing aluminium [[alloy]]s display a marked improvement in mechanical properties. Aluminium alloys form vital components of [[aircraft]] and [[rocket]]s as a result of their high strength to weight ratio. 

When aluminium is evaporated in a [[vacuum]] it forms a coating that reflects both [[visible light]] and [[infrared]]. These coatings form a thin layer of protective aluminium oxide that does not deteriorate as [[silver]] coatings do. In particular, nearly all modern [[mirror]]s are made using a thin reflective coating of aluminium on the back surface of a sheet of [[float glass]]. [[Telescope]] mirrors are also coated with a thin layer of aluminium, but are front coated to avoid internal reflections even though this makes the surface more susceptible to damage.


[[Image:Diet Coke.jpg|thumb|150px|left|An [[aluminium can]] used for the [[soft drink]] [[Diet Coke]].]]
Some of the many uses for aluminium are in:
*Transportation ([[automobile]]s, [[airplane]]s, [[truck]]s, [[railroad car]]s, marine vessels, [[bicycle]]s etc.)
*Packaging ([[aluminum can|cans]], [[aluminium foil|foil]], etc.)
*Water treatment
*Construction ([[window]]s, [[door]]s, siding, building wire, etc.
*Consumer durable goods (appliances, [[cooking utensil]]s, etc.)
*[[electricity|Electrical]] [[transmission lines]] (aluminium components and wires are less dense than those made of copper and are lower in price [http://www.metalprices.com], but also present higher electrical resistance.  Many localities prohibit the use of aluminum in residential wiring practices because of its higher resistance and thermal expansion value.)
*Machinery
*[[MKM steel]] and [[Alnico]] magnets, although non-[[magnet]]ic itself
*Super purity aluminium (SPA, 99.980% to 99.999% Al), used in electronics and [[compact disc|CD]]s.
*[[Powder]]ed aluminium, a commonly used [[silvering]] agent in [[paint]]. Aluminium flakes may also be included in undercoat paints, particularly wood [[primer (paint)|primer]] &amp;mdash; on drying, the flakes overlap to produce a water resistant barrier.
*[[Anodising|Anodised]] aluminium is more stable to further oxidation, and is used in various fields of construction, as well as [[heat sink]]ing.
*Most electronic appliances that require cooling of their internal devices (like transistors, [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s - semiconductors in general) have [[heat sink]]s that are made of aluminium due to its ease of manufacture and good heat conductivity. [[Copper]] heat sinks are smaller although more expensive and harder to manufacture.

*Aluminium oxide, [[alumina]], is found naturally as [[corundum]] ([[ruby|rubies]] and [[sapphire]]s), [[emery (mineral)|emery]], and is used in [[glass]] making. Synthetic ruby and sapphire are used in [[laser]]s for the production of [[coherent light]].

*Aluminium oxidises very energetically and as a result has found use in [[solid rocket]] fuels, [[thermite]], and other [[pyrotechnic]] compositions.

Aluminium is also a [[superconductor]], with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [[kelvin]]s.

===Engineering use===
Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ([[ANSI]]) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ([[DIN]] and [[ISO]]). Selecting the right alloy for a given application entails considerations of strength, [[ductility]], formability, [[weldability]] and [[corrosion]] resistance to name a few. A brief historical overview of alloys and manufacturing technologies is given in Ref. &lt;ref name=sanders&gt;R.E. Sanders, Technology Innovation in Aluminum Products, ''The Journal of The Minerals'', 53(2):21-25, 2001. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0102/Sanders-0102.html Online ed.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Improper use of aluminium can result in problems, particularly in contrast to [[iron]] or [[steel]], which appear &quot;better behaved&quot; to the intuitive designer, mechanic, or technician. The reduction by two thirds of the weight of an aluminium part compared to a similarly sized iron or steel part seems enormously attractive, but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a reduction by two thirds in the stiffness of the part. Therefore, although direct replacement of an iron or steel part with a duplicate made from aluminium may still give acceptable strength to withstand peak loads, the increased flexibility will cause three times more deflection in the part. 

Where failure is not an issue but excessive flex is undesirable due to requirements for precision of location or efficiency of transmission of power, simple replacement of steel tubing with similarly sized aluminium tubing will result in a degree of flex which is undesirable; for instance, the increased flex under operating loads caused by replacing steel bicycle frame tubing with aluminium tubing of identical dimensions will cause misalignment of the power-train as well as absorbing the operating force. To increase the rigidity by increasing the thickness of the walls of the tubing increases the weight proportionately, so that the advantages of lighter weight are lost as the rigidity is restored. 

Aluminium can best be used by redesigning the part to suit its characteristics; for instance making a bicycle of aluminium tubing which has an oversize diameter rather than thicker walls. In this way, rigidity can be restored or even enhanced without increasing weight. The limit to this process is the increase in susceptibility to what is termed &quot;[[buckling]]&quot; failure, where the deviation of the force from any direction other than directly along the axis of the tubing causes folding of the walls of the tubing. 

The latest models of the [[Corvette]] automobile, among others, are a good example of redesigning parts to make best use of aluminium's advantages. The aluminium chassis members and suspension parts of these cars have large overall dimensions for stiffness but are lightened by reducing cross-sectional area and removing unneeded metal; as a result, they are not only equally or more durable and stiff as the usual steel parts, but they possess an airy gracefulness which most people find attractive. Similarly, aluminium bicycle frames can be optimally designed so as to provide rigidity where required, yet have flexibility in terms of absorbing the shock of bumps from the road and not transmitting them to the rider.

The strength and durability of aluminium varies widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of the particular manufacturing process; for this reason, it has from time to time gained a bad reputation. For instance, a high frequency of failure in many early aluminium bicycle frames in the [[1970]]s resulted in just such a poor reputation; with a moment's reflection, however, the widespread use of aluminium components in the [[aerospace]] and automotive high performance industries, where huge stresses are undergone with vanishingly small failure rates, proves that properly built aluminium bicycle components should not be unusually unreliable, and this has subsequently proved to be the case. 

Similarly, use of aluminium in automotive applications, particularly in engine parts which must survive in difficult conditions, has benefited from development over time. An [[Audi]] engineer commented about the V12 engine, producing over 500 horsepower (370 kW), of an [[Auto Union#The Auto Union racing cars |Auto Union race car]] of the [[1930s]] which was recently restored by the Audi factory, that the aluminium alloy of which the engine was constructed would today be used only for lawn furniture and the like. Even the aluminium [[cylinder head]]s and [[crankcase]] of the [[Corvair]], built as recently as the [[1960s]], earned a reputation for failure and stripping of [[thread]]s in holes, even as large as [[spark plug]] holes, which is not seen in current aluminium cylinder heads.

Often, aluminium's sensitivity to heat must also be considered. Even a relatively routine workshop procedure involving heating is complicated by the fact that aluminium, as opposed to steels, will melt without first turning red. Forming operations where a [[blow torch]] is used therefore requires some expertise since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting.  Aluminium also will accumulate internal stresses and strains under conditions of overheating; while not immediately obvious, the tendency of the metal to &quot;creep&quot; under sustained stresses results in delayed distortions, for instance the commonly observed warping or cracking of aluminium automobile cylinder heads after an engine is overheated, sometimes as long as years later, or the tendency of welded aluminium bicycle frames to gradually twist out of alignment from the stresses accumulated during the welding process. For this reason, many uses of aluminium in the aerospace industry avoid heat altogether by joining parts using [[adhesive]]s; this was also used for some of the early aluminium bicycle frames in the 1970s, with unfortunate results when the aluminium tubing corroded slightly, loosening the bond of the adhesive and leading to failure of the frame. Stresses from overheating aluminium can be relieved by heat-treating the parts in an oven and gradually cooling, in effect [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the stresses; this can also result, however, in the part becoming distorted as a result of these stresses, so that such heat-treating of welded bicycle frames, for instance, results in a significant fraction becoming misaligned. If the misalignment is not too severe, once cooled they can be bent back into alignment with no negative consequences; of course, if the frame is properly designed for rigidity (see above), this will require enormous force. 

====Household wiring====
Because of its high conductivity and relatively low price compared to [[copper]] at the time, aluminium was introduced for household electrical wiring to a large degree in the United States in the 1960s. Unfortunately, many of the wiring fixtures at the time were not designed to accept aluminium wire. More specifically:

* The greater [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of aluminium, causes the wire to expand and contract relative to the dissimilar metal [[screw]] connection, eventually loosening the connection.  

* Pure aluminium has a tendency to &quot;creep&quot; under steady sustained pressure (to a greater degree as the temperature rises), again producing a degree of looseness in an initially tight connection.

* [[Galvanic cell#Galvanic corrosion|Galvanic corrosion]] from the dissimilar metals increases the electrical resistance of the connection. 

In combination, these properties caused connections between electrical fixtures and aluminium wiring to overheat which resulted in several fires. As a result, aluminium household wiring has become unpopular, and in many jurisdictions it is not permitted in very small sizes in new construction. However, aluminium wiring can be safely used with fixtures whose connections are designed to avoid loosening and overheating. Older fixtures of this type are marked &quot;Al/Cu&quot;, and newer ones are marked &quot;CO/ALR&quot;.  Otherwise, aluminium wiring can be terminated by [[crimp (metalworking)|crimping]] it to a short &quot;[[pigtail]]&quot; of copper wire, which can be treated as any other copper wire. A properly done crimp, requiring high pressure produced by the proper tool, is tight enough not only to eliminate any thermal expansion of the aluminium, but also to exclude any atmospheric oxygen and thus prevent corrosion between dissimilar metals. New alloys are used for aluminium building wire today in combination with aluminium terminations. Connections made with these standard industry products are as safe and reliable as copper connections.

==History==
The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used salts of this metal as dyeing [[mordant]]s and as astringents for dressing wounds, and [[alum]] is still used as a [[styptic]]. Further [[Joseph Needham]] suggested finds in 1974 showed the ancient Chinese used aluminium (''see &quot;notes&quot; linked above''). In 1761 [[Guyton de Morveau]] suggested calling the base alum 'alumine'. In 1808, [[Humphry Davy]] identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he named (''see [[#Spelling|Spelling]] section'').

[[Friedrich Woehler|Friedrich W√∂hler]] is generally credited with isolating aluminium ([[Latin]] ''alumen'', [[alum]]) in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium. However, the metal had been produced for the first time two years earlier in an impure form by the Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian √òrsted]]. Therefore almanacs and chemistry sites often list √òrsted as the discoverer of aluminium.[http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements/al.html#isotopes] Still it would further be P. Berthier who discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it. The Frenchman [[Henri Saint-Claire Deville]] improved W√∂hler's method in 1846 and described his improvements in a book in 1859, chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium.

The American [[Charles Martin Hall]] of [[Oberlin, OH]] applied for a [[patent]] (400655) in 1886 for an electrolytic process to extract aluminium using the same technique that was independently being developed by the Frenchman [[Paul H√©roult]] in Europe. The invention of the [[Hall-Heroult process|Hall-H√©roult process]] in 1886 made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper, and is now the principal method in common use throughout the world. The Hall-Heroult process cannot produce Super Purity Aluminium directly. Upon approval of his patent in 1889, Hall, with the financial backing of [[Alfred E. Hunt]] of [[Pittsburgh, PA]], started the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, renamed to Aluminum Company of America in 1907, later shortened to [[Alcoa]].

[[Image:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|right|The statue known as ''Eros'' in [[Piccadilly Circus]] London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium.]] Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the [[Washington Monument]], at a time when one [[ounce]] cost twice the daily wages of a common worker in the project. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9511/Binczewski-9511.html]

Germany became the world leader in aluminium production soon after [[Adolf Hitler]] seized power. By 1942, however, new hydroelectric power projects such as the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] gave the United States something Nazi Germany could not hope to compete with, namely the capability of producing enough aluminium to manufacture sixty thousand warplanes in four years.

==Natural occurrence==
Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in Earth's crust (believed to be 7.5% to 8.1%), it is very rare in its free form and was once considered a [[precious metal]] more valuable than [[gold]]. [[Napoleon III of France]] had a set of aluminium plates reserved for his finest guests. Others had to make do with gold ones. Aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years.

Aluminium was, when it was first discovered, extremely difficult to separate from its ore. Aluminium is among the most difficult metals on Earth to refine, despite the fact that it is one of the planet's most common. The reason is that aluminium is oxidised very rapidly and that its oxide is an extremely stable compound that, unlike rust on iron, does not flake off. The very reason for which aluminium is used in many applications is why it is so hard to produce.

Recovery of this metal from scrap (via [[recycling]]) has become an important component of the aluminium industry. Recycling involves simply melting the metal, which is far less expensive than creating it from ore. Refining aluminium requires enormous amounts of [[electricity]]; recycling it requires only 5% of the energy to produce it. A common practice since the early [[20th century|1900s]], aluminium recycling is not new. It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when the exploding popularity of aluminium [[beverage can]]s finally placed recycling into the public consciousness. Other sources for recycled aluminium include automobile parts, windows and doors, appliances, containers and other products.

Aluminium is a reactive metal and it is hard to extract it from its ore, [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Direct reduction, with [[carbon]] for example, is not economically viable since aluminium oxide has a melting point of about 2000 ¬∞C. Therefore, it is extracted by [[electrolysis]] &amp;mdash; the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten [[cryolite]] and then reduced to the pure metal. By this process, the actual operational temperature of the reduction cells is around 950 to 980 ¬∞C. Cryolite was originally found as a mineral on Greenland, but has been replaced by a synthetic cryolite. Cryolite is a mixture of aluminium, [[sodium]], and [[calcium]] [[fluoride]]s: (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining [[bauxite]], which is red since it contains 30 to 40% iron oxide. This is done using the so-called [[Bayer process]]. Previously, the [[Deville process]] was the predominant refining technology. 

The electrolytic process replaced the [[W√∂hler process]], which involved the reduction of anhydrous [[aluminium chloride]] with [[potassium]]. Both of the [[electrode]]s used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are [[carbon]]. Once the ore is in the molten state, its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the negative [[cathode]] is
:Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; Al

Here the aluminium ion is being reduced (electrons are added). The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off.

At the positive electrode ([[anode]]) oxygen gas is formed:
:2 O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

This carbon [[anode]] is then oxidised by the oxygen. The anodes in a reduction must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process:
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C &amp;rarr; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Contrary to the anodes, the cathodes are not consumed during the operation, since there is no oxygen present at the cathode. The carbon cathode is protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells. Cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes. After 5 to 10 years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be reconstructed completely, because the cathodes are completely worn.

Aluminium [[electrolysis]] with the [[Hall-H√©roult]] process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The world-wide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15¬±0.5 [[kilowatt-hour]]s per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg). The most modern smelters reach approximately 12.8 kW¬∑h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). Reduction line current for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kA. State-of-the-art smelters operate with about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.

Electric power represents about 20 to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the aluminium smelter. Smelters tend to be located where electric power is plentiful and inexpensive, such as [[South Africa]], the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Middle-East]], [[Russia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]].

In 2004, [[China]] was the top world producer of aluminium. [[Suriname]] depends on aluminium exports for 70% of its export earnings.[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ns.html#Econ]

==Isotopes==
Aluminium has nine [[isotope]]s, whose mass numbers range from 23 to 30. Only &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al ([[stable isotope]]) and &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al ([[radioactive_decay|radioactive]] isotope, [[half life|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 7.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[year|y]]) occur naturally, however &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al has a natural abundance of 100%.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al is produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic-ray]] [[proton]]s. Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating [[ocean|marine]] sediments, [[manganese]] nodules, glacial ice, [[quartz]] in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] exposures, and [[meteorite]]s. The ratio of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al to &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;[[beryllium|Be]] has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion on 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; year time scales.

[[Cosmogenic]] &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was first applied in studies of the [[Moon]] and meteorites. Meteorite fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding protects the meteorite fragments from further &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Possibly, the energy released by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was responsible for the remelting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of some [[asteroids]] after their formation 4.6 billion years ago.

===Clusters===
In the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' of [[14 January]] [[2005]] it was reported that clusters of 13 aluminium atoms (Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;) had been made to behave like an [[iodine]] atom; and, 14 aluminium atoms (Al&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;) behaved like an [[alkaline earth]] atom. The researchers also bound 12 iodine atoms to an Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; cluster to form a new class of polyiodide. This discovery is reported to give rise to the possibility of a new characterisation of the [[periodic table]]: [[superatom]]s. The research teams were led by Shiv N. Khanna ([[Virginia Commonwealth University]]) and A. Welford Castleman Jr ([[Penn State University]]). [http://www.science.psu.edu/alert/Castleman1-2005.htm]

==Precautions==
Aluminium is one of the few abundant elements that appears to have no beneficial function in living cells, but a few percent of people are allergic to it &amp;mdash; they experience [[contact dermatitis]] from any form of it: an itchy [[rash]] from using [[styptic]] or antiperspirant products, digestive disorders and inability to absorb nutrients from eating food cooked in aluminium pans, and vomiting and other symptoms of poisoning from ingesting such products as [[Rolaids]] , Amphojel, and [[Maalox]] ([[antacid]]s). In other people, aluminium is not considered as toxic as heavy metals, but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts, although the use of aluminium cookware, popular because of its corrosion resistance and good [[heat conduction]], has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general. Excessive consumption of [[antacid]]s containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing [[antiperspirant]]s are more likely causes of [[toxicity]]. It has been suggested that aluminium may be linked to [[Alzheimer's disease]], although that research has recently been refuted; aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the Alzheimer's damage, not the cause. In any event, if there is any toxicity of aluminium it must be via a very specific mechanism, since total human exposure to the element in the form of naturally occurring clay in soil and dust is enormously large over a lifetime.

Care must be taken to prevent aluminium from coming into contact with certain chemicals that can cause it to [[corrode]] quickly. For example, just a small amount of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] applied to the surface of a piece of aluminium can break up the aluminium oxide barrier usually present. Within a few hours, even a heavy structural beam can be significantly weakened. For this reason, mercury [[thermometer]]s are not allowed on many [[airliner]]s, as aluminium is a common structural component in aircraft.

==Spelling==
===Etymology/Nomenclature history===
In [[1808]], [[Humphry Davy]] originally proposed the name ''alumium'' while trying to isolate the new metal electrolytically from the mineral ''[[alumina]]''. In [[1812]] he changed the name to ''aluminum'' to match its [[Latin]] root. The same year, an anonymous contributor to the ''Quarterly Review'' objected to ''aluminum'', and proposed the name ''aluminium''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aluminium, for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound. (Q. Review VIII. 72, 1812)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This had the advantage of conforming to the -ium suffix precedent set by other newly discovered elements of the period: [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy had isolated himself). Nevertheless, -um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time: [[platinum]], which had been known to Europeans since the 16th century, [[molybdenum]], which was discovered in 1778, and [[tantalum]], which was discovered in 1802, all have spellings ending in -um. 

The United States adopted the -ium for most of the [[19th century]] with ''aluminium'' appearing in [[Noah Webster|Webster]]'s Dictionary of 1828. However in 1892 [[Charles Martin Hall]] used the -um spelling in an advertising handbill for his new efficient electrolytic method for the production of aluminium, despite using the -ium spelling in all of his patents filed between 1886 and 1903. It has consequently been suggested that the spelling on the flyer was a simple spelling mistake rather than a deliberate choice to use the -um spelling. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling ''aluminum'' became the standard in North America, even though the ''Webster Unabridged Dictionary'' of 1913 continued to use the -ium version.

In 1926, the [[American Chemical Society]] officially decided to use ''aluminum'' in its publications, and American dictionaries typically label the spelling ''aluminium'' as a British variant.

===Present-day spelling===
In the English-speaking world, the spellings (and associated pronunciations) ''aluminium'' and ''aluminum'' are both in common use in scientific and nonscientific contexts. In the United States, the spelling ''aluminium'' is largely unknown, and the spelling ''aluminum'' predominates. Elsewhere in the English-speaking world the spelling ''aluminium'' predominates, and the spelling ''aluminum'' is largely unknown. However, in Canada both spellings are common, due to the multiple influences on the language of its proximity to the United States, its British colonial past and the large number of native French speakers.

Outside English, the &quot;ium&quot; spelling is widespread: the word is ''aluminium'' in [[French language|French]], ''Aluminium'' in [[German language|German]], and identical or similar forms are used in many other languages. Consequently it is the more common of the two spellings in global terms, even though there may be more users of ''aluminum'' in the English-speaking world.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted ''aluminium'' as the standard international name for the element in 1990, but three years later recognised ''aluminum'' as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both, but places aluminium first [http://www.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/index.html].  IUPAC officially prefers the use of aluminium in its internal publications, although several IUPAC publications use the spelling ''aluminum.''[http://www.iupac.org/cgi-bin/htsearch?sort=score&amp;restrict=www.iupac.org%2Fpublications%2Fci&amp;config=htdig&amp;restrict=&amp;exclude=www.iupac.org%2Fgoldbook%2F&amp;words=aluminum&amp;submit=]

==Chemistry==
===Oxidation state 1===
*AlH is produced when aluminium is heated at 1500 ¬∞C in an atmosphere of [[hydrogen]].
*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[silicon]] at 1800 ¬∞C in a [[vacuum]].
*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S can be made by heating Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with aluminium shavings at 1300 ¬∞C in a vacuum. It quickly disproportionates to the starting materials. The selenide is made in a parallel manner.
*AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the tri-halide is heated with aluminium.

===Oxidation state 2===
*Aluminium suboxide, AlO can be shown to be present when aluminium powder burns in oxygen.

===Oxidation state 3===
*[[Fajans rules]] show that the simple trivalent cation Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is not expected to be found in anhydrous salts or binary compounds such as Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The hydroxide is a weak base and aluminium salts of weak bases, such as carbonate, can't be prepared. The salts of strong acids, such as nitrate, are stable and soluble in water, forming hydrates with at least six molecules of [[water of crystallization]].
*Aluminium hydride, (AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced from [[trimethylaluminium]] and an excess of hydrogen. It burns explosively in air. It can also be prepared by the action of [[aluminium chloride]] on lithium hydride in ether solution, but cannot be isolated free from the solvent.
*Aluminium carbide, Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1000 ¬∞C. The pale yellow crystals have a complex lattice structure, and react with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The acetylide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.
*Aluminium nitride, AlN, can be made from the elements at 800 ¬∞C. It is hydrolysed by water to form [[ammonia]] and aluminium hydroxide.
*Aluminium phosphide, AlP, is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]].
*Aluminium oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, occurs naturally as [[corundum]], and can be made by burning aluminium in oxygen or by heating the hydroxide, nitrate or sulfate. As a [[gemstone]], its hardness is only exceeded by [[diamond]], [[boron nitride]] and [[carborundum]]. It is almost insoluble in water.
*Aluminium hydroxide may be prepared as a gelatinous precipitate by adding ammonia to an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt. It is [[amphoteric]], being both a very weak acid, and forming aluminates with [[alkali]]s. It exists in various crystalline forms.
*Aluminium sulfide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, may be prepared by passing [[hydrogen sulfide]] over aluminium powder. It is [[polymorphic]].
*Aluminium fluoride, AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by treating the hydroxide with HF, or can be made from the elements. It consists of a giant molecule which sublimes without melting at 1291 ¬∞C. It is very inert. The other trihalides are dimeric, having a bridge-like structure.
*Organo-metallic compounds of empirical formula AlR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exist and, if not also giant molecules, are at least [[dimer]]s or trimers. They have some uses in [[organic synthesis]], for instance [[trimethylaluminium]].
*Alumino-hydrides of the most electropositive elements are known, the most useful being [[lithium aluminium hydride]], Li[AlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. It decomposes into lithium hydride, aluminium and hydrogen when heated, and is hydrolysed by water. It has many uses in organic chemistry, particularly as a reducing agent. The aluminohalides have a similar structure.

==Aluminium in popular culture==
* In the film ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] devises the fictional material [[transparent aluminum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wiktionary|abdication}}

'''Abdication''' (from the [[Latin]] ''abdicatio'', disowning, renouncing, from ''ab'', from, and ''dicare'', to declare, to proclaim as not belonging to one) is the act of renouncing and resigning from a formal office, especially from the supreme office of [[state]].  (In [[Roman law]] the term was also applied to the disowning of a family member, as the disinheriting of a son.) A similar term for an elected or appointed official is [[resignation]].

==Abdications in Classical Antiquity==
Among the most memorable abdications of antiquity were those of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] the [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] in [[79 BC]], [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] in [[305|AD 305]], and Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in [[476|AD 476]].

==The British Crown==
Probably the most famous abdication in recent memory is that of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] in [[1936]].  Edward abdicated the British throne in order to marry American divorc√©e [[Wallis Simpson]], over the objections of the British establishment, the governments of the [[Commonwealth]], the royal family and the [[Church of England]].  (''See'' [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII]].)  This was also the first time in history that the British crown was surrendered entirely voluntarily.  [[Richard II of England]], for example, was forced to abdicate after the throne was seized by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, while Richard was out of the country.

When [[James II of England]], after throwing the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] into the [[Thames]], fled to [[France]] in [[1688]], he did not formally resign the crown, and the question was discussed in Parliament whether he had forfeited the throne or had abdicated.  The latter designation was agreed upon, for in a full assembly of the Lords and Commons, met in convention, it was resolved in spite of James's protest &quot;''that King James II having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom, by breaking the original contract between king and people, and, by the advice of [[Jesuits]] and other wicked persons, having violated the fundamental laws, and having withdrawn himself out of this kingdom, has abdicated the government, and that the throne is thereby vacant.''&quot;  The [[Scottish parliament]] pronounced a decree of [[forfeiture]] and [[deposition]].  

Because the title to the Crown depends upon [[statute]], particularly the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], a Royal Abdication can only be effected by an [[Act of Parliament]]. To give legal effect to the abdication of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]], His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 was passed.

==Modern abdications==
Historically, if a monarch abdicated it was seen as a profound and shocking abandonment of royal duty. As a result, abdications usually only occurred in the most extreme circumstances of political turmoil or violence. This has changed in a small number of countries: the monarchs of the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Cambodia]] have abdicated as a result of old age. Prince [[Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein]] recently made his son [[regent]], an act which amounted to an abdication in fact if not in law.

==Notes==
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Charles abdicated as lord of the [[Netherlands]] ([[October 25]], [[1555]]) and king of [[Spain]] ([[January 16]], [[1556]]), in favor of his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. Also in 1556 he separately voluntarily abdicated his German possessions and the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Pedro IV of Portugal and Pedro I of Brazil were the same person. He was already Emperor of Brazil when he succeeded to the throne of Portugal in 1826, but abdicated it at once in favour of his daughter [[Maria II of Portugal]]. Later he abdicated the throne of Brazil in favor of his son [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Hans-Adam II made his son [[Alois of Liechtenstein|Alois]] regent, effectively abdicating; however, he still remains the formal Head of State.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CompassRose.gif|thumb|The Anglican Communion uses the [[compass rose]] as its symbol, signifying its worldwide reach and decentralized nature. It is surmounted, like ecclesiastical coats of arms, by a bishop's [[mitre]]; in the center is a [[St. George's cross | cross of St. George]] recalling the communion's origins in the [[Church of England]]. The [[Greek language | Greek]] motto, &amp;#7977; &amp;#7936;&amp;lambda;&amp;#942;&amp;theta;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha; &amp;#7952;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;&amp;upsilon;&amp;theta;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rho;&amp;#974;&amp;sigma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota; &amp;#8017;&amp;mu;&amp;#8118;&amp;sigmaf; (&quot;The truth will set you free&quot;) is a quotation from [[Gospel of John|John]] 8:32.]]

The '''Anglican Communion''' is a world-wide organisation of [[Anglican]] Churches. There is no single &quot;Anglican Church&quot; since each national or regional church has full autonomy; as the name suggests, rather, the Anglican ''Communion'' is an association of these churches in [[full communion]] with each other and particularly with the [[Church of England]], which may be regarded as the &quot;mother church&quot; of the worldwide communion. 

As a result, all [[rite]]s conducted in one member church are recognised by the others.  Some of these churches are known as Anglican, explicitly recognising the link to England; others, such as the American and Scottish [[Episcopal Church| Episcopal]] churches, or the [[Church of Ireland]], prefer a specific name. Each church has its own [[doctrine]] and [[liturgy]], based in most cases on that of the Church of England; and each church has its own legislative process and overall episcopal leadership from a local [[primate (religion) | primate]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], religious head of the Church of England, has no formal authority outside that country; but is recognised as a symbolic head for the worldwide communion. Among the other primates, he is ''primus inter pares'', or &quot;[[first among equals]].&quot; If the Archbishop of Canterbury is compared with other religious leaders such as the [[Pope]], therefore, it is only because of his prominent figurehead role in the media. He has no formal authority outside his own province.

Although they are not considered members, some non-Anglican bodies have entered into communion with the Anglican Communion despite having non-Anglican origins and traditions. There are also a number of Anglican-type bodies which separated from a member church of the Anglican Communion and thus are no longer in communion with the Church of England. They tend to call themselves &quot;[[Anglican continuing churches|continuing churches]].&quot;

==What holds the Communion together?==
{{Anglicanism}}
The Anglican Communion has no official legal existence nor any formal governing structure. (There is an &quot;[[Anglican Communion Office]]&quot; in London, under the aegis of the Archbishop of Canterbury; but it serves merely a supporting and organisational role.) Some have asked what holds the communion together.

The first attempt at an answer was the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of [[1888]]. Proposed by the American Episcopal Church in 1886 and adopted by the [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1888, it set out four principles for future Christian unity. Although wider union has not followed, the quadrilateral has been useful within the communion itself.

The quadrilateral, according to the wording adopted in Lambeth ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/Chicago_Lambeth.html]), consists of:

# &quot;The Holy Scriptures of the [[Old Testament | Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, as 'containing all things necessary to salvation', and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.&quot;
# &quot;The [[Apostles' Creed]], as the Baptismal Symbol; and the [[Nicene Creed]], as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.&quot;
# &quot;The two [[Sacrament]]s ordained by Christ Himself - Baptism and the Supper of the Lord - ministered with unfailing use of Christ's words of Institution, and of the elements ordained by Him.&quot;
# &quot;The Historic [[bishop|Episcopate]], locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church.&quot;

This, then, is the theoretical basis for unity. But what holds it together organisationally? In the last few years people have began to refer to four &quot;Instruments of Unity&quot;, which are effectively symbols to which all the churches of the communion can feel tied. In order of antiquity, they are:

* The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (''ab origine'')
* The [[Lambeth Conference]] (first held in [[1867]])
* The [[Anglican Consultative Council]] (first met in [[1971]])
* The [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting | Primates' Meeting]] (first met in [[1979]])

Since each province is legally independent and free to chart its own course, the stress on these instruments of unity can easily be imagined. In recent years, for example, some Anglicans (particularly in Africa and Asia) have been displeased with the American and Canadian branches, upset by their welcoming attitudes towards homosexuals, and by the confident way the changes have been made &amp;mdash; the conservatives condemned the action as unilateral and called for wider consultation within the communion before such steps were taken. After the North American churches reaffirmed their belief that their actions had been righteous and &quot;prophetic&quot;, they were asked to withdraw their delegates from the 2005 meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council, although it is not clear under whose authority or by what law. They were eventually permitted at the meeting with voice, but no vote. They have not been expelled or suspended from the ''communion''; indeed, no church ever has. It is unclear how such an expulsion could ever be carried out, since the communion is not a disciplinary entity but a spiritual construct based entirely on the New Testament concept of [[koinonia]].

==Provinces of the Anglican Communion==
The term &quot;province&quot; in this context refers to national churches, many of which themselves contain several provinces in the sense of groups of dioceses presided over by an archbishop. According to the Secretariat of the Anglican Communion, currently the member churches of the Anglican Communion are as follows: 

*The [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia]]

==History==

''Main article: see [[History of the Anglican Communion]]''

The Anglican Communion is a relatively recent concept. Ever since the [[Church of England]] (which until the [[20th century]] included the [[Church in Wales]]) broke from [[Roman Catholic Church | Rome]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England | Henry VIII]], it has thought of itself not as a new foundation but rather as a reformed continuation of the ancient &quot;English church&quot; and a reassertion of that church's rights. As such it was a distinctly local phenomenon. 

Thus the only members of the present Anglican Communion existing by the late 18th century were the Church of England, its closely-linked sister church, the [[Church of Ireland]] (which also broke from Rome under Henry VIII), and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which for parts of the [[17th century | 17th]] and [[18th century | 18th centuries]] was partially underground (it was suspected of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies).

However, the enormous expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries of the [[British Empire]] brought the church along with it. At first all these colonial churches were under the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of London]]. After the [[American Revolution]], the parishes in the newly independent country found it necessary to break formally from a church whose earthly head was (and remains) the [[British monarchy | British monarch]]. Thus they formed their own dioceses and national church, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], in a mostly amicable separation.

At about the same time, in the colonies which remained linked to the crown, the Church of England began to appoint colonial bishops. In 1787 a bishop of [[Nova Scotia]] was appointed with a jurisdiction over all of British North America; in time several more colleagues were appointed to other cities in present-day [[Canada]]. In [[1814]] a bishop of [[Calcutta]] was made; in [[1824]] the first bishop was sent to the [[West Indies]] and in [[1836]] to [[Australia]]. By 1840 there were still only ten colonial bishops for the Church of England; but even this small beginning greatly facilitated the growth of Anglicanism around the world. In [[1841]] a &quot;Colonial Bishoprics Council&quot; was set up and soon many more dioceses were created.

In time, it became natural to group these into provinces, and a [[metropolitan bishop | metropolitan]] appointed for each province. Although it had at first been somewhat established in many colonies, in [[1861]] it was ruled that, except where specifically established, the Church of England had just the same legal position as any other church. Thus a colonial bishop and colonial diocese was by nature quite a different thing from their counterparts back home. In time bishops came to be appointed locally rather than from England, and eventually national synods began to pass ecclesiastical legislation independent of England.

A crucial step in the development of the modern communion was the idea of the [[Lambeth Conferences]]. In [[1867]], at the suggestion of the Canadian [[synod]], the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Charles Thomas Langley]], invited a great conference of bishops to meet with him at [[Lambeth Palace]]. By inviting the bishops of the Churches of England and Ireland, those of the semi-autonomous colonial churches, and those of the fully autonomous [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], he set a precedent that they all could meet together despite the absence of universal legal ties. Some bishops were initially reluctant to attend, fearing that the meeting would declare itself a council with power to legislate for the church; but it agreed to pass only advisory resolutions. These Lambeth Conferences have been held decennially since 1878 (the second such conference), and remain the most visible coming-together of the whole communion.

==Recent controversies==
Recent disagreements over homosexuality have strained the unity of the communion as well as its relationships with other Christian denominations; see [[Anglican views of homosexuality]].

==Relationship with the Roman Catholic Church==
Efforts have been underway at least since 1966 to effect a reconciliation with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], focusing on theological issues [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/angl-comm-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19660324_paul-vi-ramsey_en.html] and ways &quot;to further the convergence on authority in the Church. Without agreement in this area we shall not reach the full visible unity to which we are both committed.&quot; [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/angl-comm-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19961205_jp-ii-carey_en.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''archipelago''' is a [[landform]] which consists of a chain or cluster of [[island|islands]]. Archipelagoes usually occur in the open sea; less commonly a large [[land mass]] may neighbour them. Archipelagoes are often [[volcano|volcanic]], forming along [[ocean ridge]]s or [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], but there are many other processes involved in their construction, including [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]].

The word comes from the [[Aegean Sea]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#953;&amp;#960;&amp;#941;&amp;#955;&amp;#945;&amp;#947;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Arcipelago''), which  literally means &quot;chief sea&quot;, from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''arkhi'' (leader) and ''pelagos'' ([[sea]]). The Aegean Sea is located between [[Greece]] in the west and [[Turkey]] in the east. In the Aegean, the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Dukes of the Archipelago]] ruled from [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]], [[1210]]&amp;ndash;[[1566]].

The [[Archipelago Exchange]] is a fully electronic [[stock exchange]] that agreed to merge with the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in April 2005 to form the for-profit NYSE Group.

'''Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle''' ([[May 22]] [[1859]] &amp;ndash; [[July 7]] [[1930]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] author most famously known for his stories about the [[Detective fiction|detective]] [[Sherlock Holmes]], which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of [[crime fiction]]. He was a prolific writer whose other works include [[science fiction]] stories, [[historical novel]]s, plays and romances, poetry, and non-fiction.

Conan was originally a [[middle name]] but he used it as part of his surname in his later years.

==Life==
Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 in [[Edinburgh]] to [[Charles Altamont Doyle|Charles]] and Mary Doyle.  He was sent to the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] [[preparatory school]] Stonyhurst at the age of nine, and by the time he left the school in [[1875]] he rejected [[Christianity]] to become an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. From [[1876]] to [[1881]] he studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], including a period working in the town of [[Aston]] (now a district of [[Birmingham]]). Following his term at University he served as a ship's doctor on a voyage to the West [[Africa]]n coast, and then in [[1882]] he set up a practice in [[Plymouth]]. He achieved his doctorate in 1885. His medical practice was unsuccessful; while waiting for patients he began writing stories. His first literary experience came in ''Chambers's Edinburgh Journal'' before he was 20.

It was only after he subsequently moved his practice to [[Southsea]] that he began to indulge more extensively in literature. His first significant work was ''A Study in Scarlet'' which appeared in ''Beeton's Christmas Annual'' for [[1887]] and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes who was modelled after Doyle's former University professor, [[Joseph Bell]]. Interestingly, [[Rudyard Kipling]] congratulated Doyle on his success, asking &quot;Could this be my old friend, Dr. Joe?&quot;.  While living in Southsea he helped form [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth Football Club]] and played as the club's first [[goalkeeper]].

In [[1885]] he married Louise Hawkins, who suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and eventually died in [[1906]]. He married Jean Leckie in [[1907]], whom he had first met and fallen in love with in [[1897]] but had maintained a [[Platonic love|platonic relationship]] with her out of loyalty to his first wife. Doyle had five children, two with his first wife (Mary and Kingsley), and three with his second wife ([[Jean Conan Doyle|Jean]], Denis, and [[Adrian Conan Doyle|Adrian]]).

In [[1890]] Doyle studied the eye in [[Vienna]], and in [[1891]] moved to [[London]] to set up a practice as an [[Ophthalmology|oculist]]. This also gave him more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: &quot;I think of slaying Holmes... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.&quot; In December 1893, he did so in order to dedicate more of his time to more &quot;important&quot; works (namely his historical novels), pitting Holmes against his arch-nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]]. They apparently plunged to their deaths together down a waterfall in the story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Public outcry led him to bring the character back&amp;mdash;Doyle returned to the story in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, with the ingenious explanation that only Moriarty had fallen, but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, he had arranged to be temporarily &quot;dead&quot; also. Holmes eventually appears in a total of 56 [[short story|short stories]] and four Doyle novels (he has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors).

Following the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in [[South Africa]] at the turn of the 20th century and the condemnation from around the world over Britain's conduct, Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled ''The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct'' which justified Britain's role in the Boer war and was widely translated. Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being knighted and appointed as Deputy-Lieutenant of [[Surrey]] in [[1902]]. He also wrote the longer book ''The Great Boer War'' in [[1900]]. During the early years of the 20th century Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], once in Edinburgh and once in the Border Burghs, but although he received a respectable vote he was not elected.  
[[Image:conandoylestatue.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Conan Doyle statue in Crowborough]]Conan Doyle was involved in the campaign for the reform of the [[Congo Free State]], led by the journalist [[E. D. Morel]] and the diplomat [[Roger Casement]]. He wrote [[The Crime of the Congo]] in [[1909]], a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in Congo. He become acquainted with Morel and Casement, taking inspiration from them for two of the main characters of the novel [[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]] (1912). He broke with both when Morel (who was rather left-wing) became one of the leaders of the pacifist movement during the [[World War I|First World War]], and Casement committed treason against Britain out of conviction for his [[Ireland|Irish]] nationalist views.  Doyle tried, unsuccessfully, to save Casement from the death penalty, arguing that he had been driven mad and was not responsible for his actions.

Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice, and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two imprisoned men being released.  The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]], who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were dead set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued even after their suspect was jailed. It was partially as a result of this case that the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] was established in [[1907]], so not only did Conan Doyle help George Edalji, his work helped to establish a way to correct other [[miscarriages of justice]]. The story of Conan Doyle and Edalji is told in fictional form in [[Julian Barnes]]'s 2005 [[novel]], [[Arthur &amp; George]].

The second case&amp;mdash;that of [[Oscar Slater]], a German Jew and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in [[1908]]&amp;mdash;excited Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed. 

In his later years, Doyle became involved with [[Spiritualism]], to the extent that he wrote a [[Professor Challenger]] novel on the subject, ''The Land of Mist''. One of the odder aspects of this period of his life was his book ''The Coming of the Fairies'' ([[1921]]). He was apparently totally convinced of the veracity of the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs, which he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits. His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short story collections, [[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]], was banned in the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1929]] for supposed [[occult]]ism. This ban was later removed.

Doyle was friends for a time with the American magician [[Harry Houdini]], a prominent opponent of the Spiritualist movement. Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently attempted to expose them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers, a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''.  Houdini was apparently unable to convince Doyle that his feats were simply magic tricks, leading to a bitter, public falling out between the two.

[[Richard Milner]], an [[United States|American]] historian of science, has presented a case that Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the [[Piltdown man]] hoax of [[1912]], creating the counterfeit [[hominid]] [[fossil]] that fooled the scientific world for over 40 years. Milner says that Doyle had a motive, namely revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics, and that ''The Lost World'' contains several encrypted clues regarding his involvement in the hoax. [http://www.arts.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml;jsessionid=JXWTHVY1DHO5NQFIQMGSNAGAVCBQWJVC?html=/archive/1997/03/20/npil20.html]

[[Samuel Rosenberg]]'s [[1974]] book ''[[Naked is the Best Disguise]]'' purports to explain how Doyle left, throughout his writings, open clues that related to hidden and suppressed aspects of his mentality.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died of a [[heart attack]] in [[1930]] and is buried in the Church Yard at [[Minstead]] in the [[New Forest]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]].

A statue has been erected in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's honour. It may be seen at Crowborough Cross in [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]], where Sir Arthur lived for 23 years. There is also a statue of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]] in Picardy Place, [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] - close to the house where Conan Doyle was born.

An '''author''' is the person who creates a written work, such as a [[book]], story, article or the like. This can be short or long, fiction or nonfiction, [[poetry]] or prose, technical or [[literature]]. Since [[capitalism]], the '''author''' also needs to do it for [[payment]] (as a [[service]]).

==Role in critical theory==

One key issue in [[literary theory]] is the relationship between the meaning of a literary [[text]] and its author's conscious intent.

* The phrase &quot;[[death of the author|Death of the Author]]&quot; was popularized by [[Roland Barthes]] in his [[1968]] essay with the same name. It is used to convey the idea that [[Text|texts]] have meaning and an independent existence outside that intended by the author, depending on the context and reader.

* The death of the author is in self-conscious opposition to the [[New Criticism]], a literary critical movement popular in England and America in the first half of the 20th century. According to this movement, the author's intent is assumed to be quite clear to the author and it becomes the critic's task to understand this intent.

'''Andrey Andreyevich Markov''' (–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤) ([[June 14]], [[1856]] [[N.S.]] - [[July 20]], [[1922]]) was a [[Russia|Russian]] [[mathematician]].

Markov was born in [[Ryazan]]. He studied at [[Saint Petersburg State University|St. Petersburg University]] in [[1874]] under the tutelage of [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]]. In [[1886]], he became a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St. Petersburg Academy of Science]]. He is best known for his work on theory of [[stochastic process]]es. His research later became known as [[Markov chain]]s.

      <comment>Alumnus status is a RELATIONSHIP between the person and the school.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- So far we have a dictionary definition and a discussion of the correct use of the term --&gt;
An '''alumnus''' (masculine) or '''alumna''' (feminine) of a [[colleges and universities|college, university]], or school is a former student.  Informal equivalents are '''alum''' and '''alumn''' (with a silent &quot;n&quot;).  The term is often mistakenly thought of as synonymous with &quot;graduate.&quot; Alumni/ae [[reunion]]s are popular events at many institutions. They are usually organized by [[alumni association]]s and are often social occasions for [[fundraising]].

In [[Latin]], ''alumnus'' is the masculine singular form and ''alumna'' the feminine singular form. (The words are derived from the Latin verb ''alere'', &quot;to nourish,&quot; and literally mean &quot;nourished one&quot; or &quot;nursling.&quot;) Although these terms are recommended by leading [[English language|English-language]] [[dictionary|dictionaries]], their use can be limited because they are [[non-sexist language|gender-specific]]. The Latin plural is '''alumni''' for men and mixed groups and '''alumnae''' for women. The gender-neutral English term ''alum''/''alumn'', created by [[clipping#Linguistics|clipping]] the ending from ''alumnus'', is also used, along with its plural '''alums'''/'''alumns'''.

Recently, the definition of &quot;alum&quot; has expanded to include people who have &quot;[[matriculation|matriculated]] at&quot; or exited from any kind of organization or process. As such, one can potentially be a &quot;corporate alum&quot; of XYZ Company, or an alum of a military branch, [[non-profit organization]], or training process.  

Educational institutions tend to follow Latin usage: ''alumnus'' for males, ''alumna'' for females, and ''alumni'' for mixed groups. All-women colleges use ''alumna'' and ''alumnae''. Some institutions, such as [[Texas A&amp;M University]], do not refer to their graduates as &quot;alumni&quot; or even &quot;graduates,&quot; choosing to use the term ''former students''.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Australia]], the phrases '''old boy''' and '''old girl''' are traditionally used for former school pupils, and '''old member''' for former university students. Some private schools in [[Canada]], such as [[Upper Canada College]] and the [[Bishop Strachan School]] also use '''old boy''' and '''old girl'''. The term '''old student''' can nowadays refer to the graduates of either schools or universities. In Scotland, the term ''Former Pupil'' (FP) is also used, especially when referring to sports teams of a school.

{{emotion}}
'''''Angst''''' is a [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[North Germanic language|North Germanic]] word for [[fear]] or [[anxiety]]. It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of internal emotional strife.

A different but related meaning is attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]] ([[1813]]&amp;ndash;[[1855]]). Kierkegaard used the word ''angst'' (Danish, meaning &quot;dread&quot;) to describe a profound and deep-seated [[spirituality|spiritual]] condition of insecurity and [[despair]] in the free [[human being]]. Where the animal is a slave to its God-given instincts but always confident in its own actions, Kierkegaard believed that the freedom given to mankind leaves the human in a constant fear of failing its responsibilities to [[God]]. Kierkegaard's concept of angst is considered to be an important stepping stone for 20th-century [[existentialism]].

While Kierkegaard's feeling of angst is fear of actual responsibility to [[god (monotheism)|God]], in modern  use, angst is broadened to include general frustration associated with the conflict between actual responsibilities to self, one's principles, and others (possibly including God). Still, the angst in alternative music may be more accessible to most audiences than the esoteric tradition of [[existentialism]]. The term &quot;angst&quot; is now widely used with a negative and derisive connotation that mocks the expression of a common adolescent experience of malaise.

==Angst in contemporary music==
Angst, in contemporary connotative use, most often describes the intense frustration and other related emotions of [[teenager]]s and the mood of the music with which they identify. [[Punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[emo (music)|emo]], and virtually any [[Alternative Rock]] dramatically combining elements of discord, [[melancholy]] and excitement may be said to assert angst. There is an obvious connection to this music and the various subjugation of its proponent youth or racial or sociopolitical minority [[subculture]].

Angst was probably first discussed in relation to contemporary music in the mid to late 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s &quot;teen angst&quot; was expressed in music to a certain extent in the rise of &quot;punk&quot;, but the word &quot;angst&quot; is currently more associated with, and was probably first used in reference to, the grunge movement and the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].  Nirvana themselves seem to have been aware of this, as evidenced by the first line of [[Serve the Servants]] in which [[Kurt Cobain]] describes the success of writing songs dealing with the subject (''Teenage angst has paid off well | Now I'm bored and old...'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anxiety''' refers to a complex combination of negative emotions that includes [[fear]], apprehension and worry, and is often accompanied by physical sensations such as [[Palpitation| palpitations]], chest pain and/or shortness of breath. 

Anxiety is often described as having [[cognitive]], [[somatic]], [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al components (Seligman, Walker &amp; Rosenhan, 2001). The cognitive component entails expectation of a diffuse and uncertain danger. Somatically the body prepares the organism to deal with threat (known as an emergency reaction); [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]] are increased, sweating is increased, bloodflow to the major muscle groups is increased, and [[immune system|immune]] and [[Digestion|digestive]] system functions are inhibited. Externally, somatic signs of anxiety may include pale skin, sweating, trembling and [[Mydriasis|pupillary dilation]]. Emotionally, anxiety causes a sense of dread or panic, nausea and chills. Behaviorally, both voluntary and involuntary behaviors may arise directed at escaping or avoiding the source of anxiety. These behaviors are frequent and often maladaptive, being most extreme in [[anxiety disorder]]s. However, anxiety is not always pathological or maladaptive: it is a common emotion along with fear, anger, sadness and happiness, and it has a very important function in relation to survival. 

Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]] is thought to underlie anxiety (Rosen &amp; Schulkin, 1998). When confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the amygdala (Zald &amp; Pardo, 1997; Zald, Hagen &amp; Pardo, 2002). In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors such as feeding on rotten food.  
 
A chronically recurring case of anxiety that has a serious effect on a person's life may be clinically diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. The most common are [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[panic disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[phobia]]s, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

==Diagnosis==

A good assessment is essential for the initial diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, preferably using a standardised interview or questionnaire procedure alongside expert evaluation and the views of the person themselves. There should be a medical examination in order to identify possible medical conditions that can cause the symptoms of anxiety. A family history of anxiety disorders is suggestive of the possibility of an anxiety disorder.

==Diagnosis using a blood test==

In 2005 a research team from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] developed a method for potentially detecting raised anxiety by performing a simple blood test. This is only an early unreplicated study of a possible screening tool. [http://www.isracast.com/tech_news/101005_tech.htm]

==Generalized anxiety disorder==
{{main|General anxiety disorder}}

Generalized anxiety disorder is a common chronic disorder that affects twice as many women as men and can lead to considerable impairment (Brawman-Mintzer &amp; Lydiard, 1996, 1997).  As the name implies, generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any particular object or situation. In other words it is unspecific or free-floating. People with this disorder feel afraid of something but are unable to articulate the specific fear. They fret constantly and have a hard time controlling their worries. Because of persistent muscle tension and autonomic fear reactions, they may develop headaches, heart palpitations, dizziness, and insomnia. These physical complaints, combined with the intense, long-term anxiety, make it difficult to cope with normal daily activities.

==Panic disorder==
{{main|Panic disorder}}

In panic disorder, a person suffers brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension that cause trembling and shaking, dizziness, and difficulty breathing.  One who is often plagued by sudden bouts of intense anxiety might be said to be afflicted by this disorder.  The American Psychiatric Association (2000) defines a panic attack as fear or discomfort that arises abruptly and peaks in 10 minutes or less. 

Although panic attacks sometimes seem to occur out of nowhere, they generally happen after frightening experiences, prolonged stress, or even exercise.  Many people who have panic attacks (especially their first one) think they are having a heart attack and often end up at the doctor or ER. Even if the tests all come back normal the person will still worry, with the physical manifestations of anxiety only reinforcing their fear that something is wrong with their body. Extreme awareness of every little thing that happens or changes with their body can make for a stressful time.

Normal changes in heartbeat, such as when climbing a flight of stairs will be noticed by a panic sufferer and lead them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. Some begin to worry excessively and even quit jobs or refuse to leave home to avoid future attacks.  Panic disorder can be diagnosed when several apparently spontaneous attacks lead to a persistent concern about future attacks.  A common complication of panic disorder is [[agoraphobia]] -- anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing (Craske, 2000; Gorman, 2000).

==Phobia==
{{main|Phobia}}

This category involves a strong, irrational fear and avoidance of an object or situation.  The person knows the fear is irrational, yet the anxiety remains.  Phobic disorders differ from generalized anxiety disorders and panic disorders because there is a specific stimulus or situation that elicits a strong fear response.  Imagine how it would feel to be so frightened by a spider that you would try to jump out of a speeding car to get away from it.  This is how a person suffering from phobia might feel.

People with phobias have especially powerful imaginations, so they vividly anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering such feared objects as knives, bridges, blood, enclosed places, or certain animals.  These individuals recognize that their fears are excessive and unreasonable but are generally unable to control their anxiety.

In addition to specific phobias, such as fears of knives, rats or spiders, there is another category of phobias known as social phobias.  Individuals with this disorder experience intense fear of being negatively evaluated by others or of being publicly embarrassed because of impulsive acts.  Almost everyone experiences &quot;stage fright&quot; when speaking or performing in front of a group.  But people with social phobias become so anxious that performance is out of the question.  In fact, their fear of public scrutiny and potential humiliaton becomes so pervasive that normal life is impossible (den Boer 2000; Margolis &amp; Swartz, 2001). Another social phobia is [[love-shyness]], which most adversely affects certain men. Those afflicted find themselves unable to initiate intimate adult relationships (Gilmartin 1987).

==Obsessive-compulsive disorder==
{{main|Obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
Obsessive compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are distressing, repetitive thoughts or images that the individual often realizes are senseless. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that the person feels forced or compelled into doing, in order to relieve anxiety. One example would be the obsession of extreme cleanliness and fear of contamination, which may lead to the compulsion of having to wash one's hands hundreds of times a day. Another example may be the obsession that one's door is unlocked, which may lead to the constant checking and rechecking of doors.

==Treatment overview==

Mainstream treatment for anxiety consists of the prescription of [[anxiolytic]] agents and/or referral to a [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] therapist. There are indications that a combination of the two can be more effective than either one alone.

===Prescription medication===

The acute symptoms of anxiety are most often controlled with anxiolytic agents such as [[benzodiazepine]]s. [[Diazepam]] (valium) was one of the first such drugs. Today we see a wide range of anti-anxiety agents that are based on benzodiazepines, although only two have been approved for panic attacks, [[Clonazepam|Klonopin]] and [[Alprazolam|Xanax]].  All benzodiazepines are physically addictive, and extended use should be carefully monitored by a physician, preferably a psychiatrist. It is very important that once placed on a regimen of regular benzodiazepine use, the user should not abruptly discontinue the medication. 

Some of the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have been used with varying degrees of success to treat patients with chronic anxiety, the best results seen with those who exhibit symptoms of clinical depression and non-specific anxiety or general anxiety disorder concurrently.  [[Beta blockers]] are also sometimes used to treat the somatic symptoms associated with anxiety, especially the shakiness of &quot;stage fright.&quot;

Many scientists believe that the benzodiazepines and other antianxiety drugs are greatly overprescribed and potentially addictive. See, for example, [[Fred Leavitt]]'s ''The REAL Drug Abusers'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003). The addicitive nature of the benzodiazepine class became apparent in the mid 1960's when Valium (Diazepam), the first drug in the class to win FDA approval, resulted in thousands of people who quickly showed the classic symptoms of addiction when used for more than a week or two consistently. 

The most addictive of the benzodiazepines appears to be [[Alprazolam|Xanax]] due to its rapid onset and short half life in the blood stream. Xanax also has the dubious distinction of being the only benzodiazepine that often requires hospitalization for discontinuation as a precaution against dangerous and sometimes fatal seizures as part of the detoxification process. No other medications in this class have shown this fatal side effect, although abrupt discontinuation of virtually any benzodiazepine can result in cravings, stomach pains, cramps, increased anxiety, insomnia and other signs of withdrawal.

===Cognitive-behavioral therapy ===

[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is the most popular and effective form of [[psychotherapy]] used to treat anxiety. The goal of the cognitive-behavioral therapist is to decrease avoidance behaviors and help the patient develop coping skills. This 
may entail:

* Challenging false or self-defeating beliefs.
* Developing a positive self-talk skill.
* Developing negative thought replacement.
* Systematic [[desensitization]], also called ''exposure'' (used for [[agoraphobia]] and [[OCD]] mainly).
* Providing knowledge that will help the patient cope. (For example, someone who suffers from panic may be informed that fast, prolonged, heart palpitations are in themselves harmless).

Unlike prescription medication, the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy depends on various subjective factors, such as therapist competence.  In addition to conventional therapy, there are at-home cognitive-behavioral programs sufferers can use as part of their treatment.

===Other coping strategies===

A variety of over the counter supplements and medications are also used for their alleged anti-anxiety properties, however there is little scientific evidence to back up these claims. [[Kava Kava]] is a popular herbal treatment; small doses either taken regularly through the day or when early symptoms are noticed by the patient. [[Valerian root]] is also reputed to have anti-anxiety and sedative properties, as are [[passion fruit]], [[passion flower]], [[St. John's wort]], [[hops]], and [[chamomile]].

Popular nutritional supplements for dealing with anxiety include [[magnesium]] and [[B vitamins|B-complex]] vitamins.

Self help and relaxation techniques also play an important role in relieving anxiety symptoms. Self help includes:

* Proper diet - This includes reduction in consumption of caffeine, sugar, and generally an improvement of eating habits. Caffeine reduction should be gradual. Some anxiety sufferers report considerable reductions in their anxiety just from taking these measures.
* Exercise - Some exercise is thought to relieve stress. Anxiety sufferers should note that rapid heart palpitations during exercise can trigger a panic attack, so it is probably better to gradually develop an exercise routine while on a cognitive-behavioral program.
* Laughing
* Breathing techniques and proper breathing - A diaphragmic breathing technique is often recommended (as opposed to chest breathing).
* Proper sleep.
* Relaxation techniques - A state of relaxation can be achieved with the help of relaxation tapes, [[Yoga]] or [[relaxation therapy]].
* Stress management.- This may entail changes in lifestyle and time management. There are a number of books specialized in stress management.
* Panic attack coping strategies - Specific strategies for dealing with panic episodes have been proposed, such as slow abdominal breathing and use of reassuring self-talk.
* Search for meaning and purpose - Some experts have indicated that residual generalized anxiety can be the result of a sort of &quot;[[boredom]]&quot; about existence. They recommend looking for an occupation the sufferer finds meaningful. 

[[Alcoholic beverage|Alcoholic drinks]] are probably the most widely used substance for the alleviation of anxiety. Anxiety sufferers are cautioned that alcohol is also a powerful depressant and has a plethora of dangerous and uncomfortable side effects in addition to being highly addictive.

==Anxiety in palliative care==
Some research has strongly suggested that treating anxiety in [[cancer]] patients improves their quality of life. The treatment generally consists of counselling, relaxation techniques or pharmacologically with benzodiazepines.

==Anxiety and alternative medicine==

A 2002 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm survey (see table 3 on page 9)] found that [[complementary and alternative methods]] were used to treat anxiety/[[clinical depression|depression]] by 4.5 percent of U.S. adults who used CAM.

==Existential anxiety==

Theologians like [[Paul Tillich]] and psychologists like [[Sigmund Freud]] have characterized anxiety as the reaction to what Tillich called, &quot;The trauma of nonbeing.&quot; That is, the human comes to realize that there is a point at which they might cease to be (die), and their encounter with reality becomes characterized by anxiety. [[Religion]], according to both Tillich and Freud, then becomes a carefully-crafted coping mechanism in response to this anxiety.

==Test anxiety==

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam. Students suffering from test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth, embarrassment by a teacher, taking a class that is beyond their ability, fear of alienation from parents or friends, time pressures, or feeling a loss of control.  Emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physical components can all be present in test anxiety. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, and drumming on a desk are all common. An optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam; however, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, it results in a decline in performance.

'''Alan Alexander Milne''' ([[January 18]], [[1882]] &amp;ndash; [[January 31]], [[1956]]), also known as '''A. A. Milne''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], best known for his [[book]]s about the animated [[teddy bear]], [[Winnie the Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh]], and for various children's poems. Milne had made several reputations, most notably as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.

==Biography==

Milne was born in [[Scotland]] but raised in [[London]] at a small private school in Kilburn run by his father John Vine Milne. One of his teachers was [[H. G. Wells]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he studied on a [[mathematics]] [[scholarship]]. While there, he edited and wrote for ''[[Granta]]'', a student magazine. He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch, where Milne was to become a contributor and later assistant editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. 

His son [[Christopher Robin Milne|Christopher Robin]] was born in [[1920]]. Milne joined the [[British Army]] in [[World War I]] but after the war wrote a denunciation of war titled ''[[Peace with Honour]]'' ([[1934]]) (which he retracted somewhat in [[1940]] with ''[[War with Honour]]''). 

During the war, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English comic writer [[P.G. Wodehouse]], who was captured at his country home in [[France]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the lighthearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near [[treason]] by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories. 

In [[1925]], Milne bought a country home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]]. He retired to the farm after brain surgery in [[1952]] left him an invalid.

== Literary career ==

Milne is most famous for his Pooh books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]], after his son, and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie the Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh]]. (Reputedly, a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named Winnie (after [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]), used as a military mascot by the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, a Canadian Infantry Regiment in World War I and left to [[London Zoo]] after the war, is the source of the name.) [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own teddy, Growler (&quot;a magnificent bear&quot;) as the model; Christopher Robin's own toys are now under glass in New York.

The overwhelming success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased, and who until then had found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[JM Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a durable, character-led and witty piece of detective writing in ''The Red House Mystery'' -- indeed, his publisher was displeased when he announced his intention to write poems for children -- and he had never lacked an audience. 

But once Milne had, in his own words, &quot;said Goodbye to all that in 70,000 words&quot;, the approximate length of the four children's books, he had no intention of producing a copy of a copy, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play (&quot;God help it&quot;) was simply &quot;Christopher Robin grown up ... what an obsession with me children are become!&quot;  

Even his old home, ''Punch'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography ''The Enchanted Places'', though Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author). 

After Milne's death, the rights to the Pooh characters were sold by his widow, Daphne to [[the Walt Disney Company]], which has made a number of Pooh cartoon movies, as well as a large amount of Pooh-related merchandise. She also destroyed his papers.

Milne also wrote a number of poems, including ''Vespers'', ''They're Changing Guard at [[Buckingham Palace]]'', and ''King John's Christmas'', which were published in the books ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'' and ''[[Now We Are Six]]''.
His poems have been parodied many times, including the books When We Were Rather Older and  ''[[Now We Are Sixty]]''.

He also adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' could not survive translation to the theater.

== Biographies ==

Milne's friend Frank Swinnerton's book ''The Georgian Literary Scene'' contains a substantial section about him; his son has written several books of autobiography: ''The Enchanted Places'', in particular, is an account of his attempt to escape from the shadow of a famous father and a burdensome name; ''The Path Through the Trees'' continues the story into adult life. Ann Thwaites' ''AA Milne: His Life'' is an excellent and detailed biography, although it gives little space to the plays; a spin-off book tells the story for a younger readership, concentrating on Pooh.

'''Addiction''' is a [[compulsion]] to repeat a behaviour regardless of its consequences. A person who is addicted is sometimes called an '''addict'''. 

There is a lack of consensus as to what may properly be termed 'addiction.' Some within the medical community maintain a rigid definition of addiction and contend that the term is only applicable to a process of escalating drug or alcohol use as a result of repeated exposure. However, addiction is often applied to compulsive [[behavior]]s other than drug use, such as overeating or gambling. In all cases, the term addiction describes a chronic pattern of behaviour that continues despite the direct or indirect adverse consequences that result from engaging in the behavior. It is quite common for an addict to express the desire to stop the behaviour, but find himself or herself unable to cease. 

Addiction is often characterized by a craving for more of the drug or behavior, increased [[physiological tolerance]] to exposure, and [[withdrawal]] symptoms in the absence of the stimulus. Many drugs and behaviours that provide either pleasure or relief from pain pose a risk of addiction or [[chemical dependency|dependency]].

==Terminology and usage==
The medical community now makes a careful theoretical distinction between ''physical dependence'' (characterized by symptoms of [[withdrawal]]) and ''psychological addiction'' (or simply ''addiction''). Addiction is now narrowly defined as &quot;uncontrolled, compulsive use despite harm&quot;; if there is no harm being suffered by, or damage done to, the patient or another party, then clinically it may be considered compulsive, but within this narrow definition it is not categorized as &quot;addiction&quot;. In practice, however, the two kinds of addiction are not always easy to distinguish. Addictions often have both physical and psychological components.

There is also a lesser known situation called [[pseudo-addiction]], where a patient will exhibit drug-seeking behaviour reminiscent of psychological addiction, however in this case, the patients tend to have genuine pain or other symptoms that have been undertreated.  Unlike true psychological addiction, however, these behaviours tend to stop as soon as their pain is adequately treated. 
The term &quot;''[[dry drunk]]''&quot; is sometimes attached to patterns of behavior that persist after an object of dependence and/or misuse
has been removed from daily living routines.  This type of behaviour is fairly common in early recovery for those recovering from substance misuse.   

The obsolete term ''physical addiction'' is deprecated, because of its connotations. In modern pain management with opioids: physical dependence is nearly universal but addiction is rare. Some of the highly addictive drugs (''[[hard drug]]s''), such as [[cocaine]], induce relatively little physical dependence.

Not all doctors do agree on what addiction or dependency is*, particularly because traditionally, addiction has been defined as being possible only to a psychoactive substance (for example [[alcoholism|alcohol]],  [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco]], or [[drug addiction|drugs]]), which is ingested, crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]], and alters the natural chemical behaviour of the brain temporarily. Many people, both psychology professionals and laypersons, now feel that there should be accommodation made to include psychological dependency on such things as [[gambling]], [[overeating|food]], [[hypersexuality|sex]], [[pornography addiction|pornography]], [[computer addiction|computers]], [[workaholic|work]], and [[shopping]] / spending. However, these are things or tasks which, when used or performed, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and hence, do not fit into the traditional view of addiction. Symptoms mimicking withdrawal may occur with abatement of such behaviours; however, it is said by those who adhere to a traditionalist view that these withdrawal-like symptoms are not strictly reflective of an addiction, but rather of a behavioural disorder. In spite of traditionalist protests and warnings that overextension of definitions may cause the wrong treatment to be used (thus failing the person with the behavioural problem), popular media, and some members of the field, do represent the aforementioned behavioural examples as addictions.
*note: the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM IVR) specifically spells out criteria to define abuse and dependence conditions.

==Varied forms of addiction==
===Physical dependency===
''Physical dependency'' on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic [[withdrawal]] symptoms when the drug is suddenly discontinued. While opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol and nicotine are all well known for their ability to induce physical dependence, other drugs share this property that are not considered addictive: cortisone, [[beta-blockers]] and most antidepressants are examples. So while physical dependency can be a major factor in the psychology of addiction, the primary attribute of an addictive drug is its ability to induce euphoria while causing harm.  

Some drugs induce [[withdrawal|physical dependence]] or [[physiological tolerance]] - but not addiction - for example many [[laxative]]s, which are not psychoactive; nasal [[decongestants]], which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days in a row; and some [[antidepressants]], most notably [[Effexor]] and [[Paxil]], as they have quite short [[half-lives]], so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants.  Many non-addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped, so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them.

The speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance, the frequency of use, the means of ingestion, and the individual. Some [[alcoholic]]s report they exhibited alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication, while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted. Because of this variation, some people hypothesise that physical dependency and addiction are in large part genetically moderated. [[Nicotine]] is one of the most addictive [[psychoactive]] substances: although 35 million smokers make an attempt to quit every year, less than 7% achieve even one year of abstinence.* 

While [[eating disorders]], like other behavioral addictions, are usually considered primarily psychological disorders, they are sometimes treated as addictions, especially if they include elements of addictive behavior. Sufferers may experience withdrawal or withdrawal-like symptoms if they alter their diet suddenly. This suggests that some common food substances, especially [[chocolate]], [[sugar]], [[salt]] and white flour may have the potential for addiction. In addition, frequent [[Wiktionary:overeat|overeat]]ing can also be considered an addiction.

* From the NIDA research report on nicotine addiction.

===Psychological addiction===
''[[Psychological addictions]]'' are a dependency of the mind, and lead to psychological withdrawal symptoms. Addictions can theoretically form for any rewarding behavior, or as a habitual means to avoid undesired activity, but typically they only do so to a clinical level in individuals who have emotional, social, or [[Mental illness|psychological dysfunctions]], taking the place of normal positive stimuli not otherwise attained (see [[Rat Park]]).

== Addiction and drug control legislation == 

Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like [[substance]]s under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, hallucinogens and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs, and unlicensed production, supply or possession is a criminal offence. 

Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever.

Also, although the legislation may be justifiable on moral or public health grounds, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual: reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure, and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment.

==Methods of care== 

Early editions of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) described addiction as a physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence. Recent editions, including DSM-IV, have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions as dependency, rather than addiction. The [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] recommends treatment for people with chemical dependency based on [[patient placement criteria]] (currently listed in PPC-2), which attempt to match levels of care according to clinical assessments in six areas, including:
* Acute intoxication and/or withdrawal potential 
* Biomedical conditions or complications 
* Emotional/behavioral conditions or complications 
* Treatment acceptance/resistance 
* [[Relapse]] potential 
* Recovery environment 

Some medical systems, including those of at least 15 states of the United States, refer to an [[Addiction Severity Index]] to assess the severity of problems related to substance use. The index assesses problems in six areas: medical, employment/support, alcohol and other drug use, legal, family/social, and psychiatric.

While addiction or dependency is related to seemingly uncontrollable urges, and may have roots in genetic predisposition, treatment of dependency is always classified as behavioral medicine. Early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical detoxification, which can include doses of [[anxiolytic]]s to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. In chronic opiate addiction, a surrogate drug such as [[methadone]] is sometimes offered as a form of [[opiate replacement therapy]]. But treatment approaches universally focus on the individual's ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action. 

Therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either interested or not interested in changing. Treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the addictive stimulus, and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction. Clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that effect addictive behavior, using therapeutic interviews in an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy, addictive sources of pleasure or relief from pain.

==Diverse explanations==
Several explanations (or &quot;models&quot;) have been presented to explain addiction:

*The ''[[moral]] model'' states that addictions are the result of human weakness, and are defects of [[moral character|character]]. Those who advance this model do not accept that there is any biological basis for addiction. They often have scant sympathy for people with serious addictions, believing either that a person with greater moral strength could have the force of will to break an addiction, or that the addict demonstrated a great moral failure in the first place by starting the addiction. The moral model is widely applied to dependency on illegal substances, perhaps purely for social or political reasons, but is no longer widely considered to have any therapeutic value. Elements of the moral model, especially a focus on individual choices, have found enduring roles in other approaches to the treatment of dependencies.  

*The ''[[opponent-process]] model'' generated by Richard Soloman states that for every psychological event A will be followed by its opposite psychological event B.  For example, the pleasure one experiences from heroin is followed by an opponent process of withdrawal, or the terror of jumping out of an airplane is rewarded with intense pleasure when the parachute opens. This model is related to the opponent process color theory.  If you look at the color red then quickly look at a gray area you will see green.  There are many examples of opponent processes in the nervous system including taste, motor movement, touch, vision, and hearing. Opponent-processes occurring at the sensory level may translate &quot;down-stream&quot; into addictive or habit-forming behavior. 

*The ''[[disease]] model'' holds that addiction is an illness, and comes about as a result of the impairment of healthy [[neurochemistry|neurochemical]] or behavioral processes. While there is some dispute among clinicians as to the reliability of this model, it is widely employed in therapeutic settings. Most treatment approaches involve recognition that dependencies are behavioral dysfunctions, and thus involve some element of physical or mental disease.

*The ''[[genetics|genetic]] model'' posits a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors. It is frequently noted that certain addictions &quot;run in the family,&quot; and while researchers continue to explore the extent of genetic influence, there is strong evidence that genetic predisposition is often a factor in dependency. Researchers have had difficulty assessing differences, however, between social causes of dependency learned in family settings and genetic factors related to [[heredity]].

*The ''[[culture|cultural]] model'' recognizes that the influence of culture is a strong determinant of whether or not individuals fall prey to certain addictions. For example, alcoholism is rare among [[Saudi Arabia]]ns, where obtaining alcohol is difficult and using alcohol is prohibited. In North America, on the other hand, the incidence of [[gambling]] addictions soared in the last two decades of the [[20th century]], mirroring the growth of the gaming industry. Half of all patients diagnosed as alcoholic are born into families where alcohol is used heavily, suggesting that familiar influence, genetic factors, or more likely both, play a role in the development of addiction.

*The ''blended model'' attempts to consider elements of all other models in developing a therapeutic approach to dependency. It holds that the mechanism of dependency is different for different individuals, and that each case must be considered on its own merits.

*The ''[[habit]] model'' proposed by [[Thomas Szasz]] questions the very concept of &quot;addiction.&quot; He argues that addiction is a metaphor, and that the only reason to make the distinction between habit and addiction &quot;is to persecute somebody.&quot; [http://www.szasz.com/drugsandfreedom1973.html (Szasz, 1973)]

==Neurobiological basis==
The development of addiction is thought to involve a simultaneous process of 1) increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and 2) the attenuation or &quot;shutting down&quot; of other behaviors. For example, animals allowed the unlimited ability to self-administer psychoactive drugs will show such a strong preference that they will forgo food, sleep, and sex for continued access. The neuro-anatomical correlate of this that the brain regions involved in driving goal-directed behavior grow increasingly selective for particular motivating stimuli and rewards, to the point that the brain regions involved in the inhibition of behavior can no longer effectively send &quot;stop&quot; signals. A good analogy is to imagine flooring the gas pedal in a car with very bad brakes. In this case, the limbic system is thought to be the major &quot;driving force&quot; and the orbitofrontal cortex is the substrate of the top-down inhibition. 

A specific portion of the limbic circuit known as the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is hypothesized to play an important role in translation of motivation to motor behavior- and reward-related learning in particular.  It is typically defined as the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the bundle of dopamine-containing fibres that connecting them. This system is commonly implicated in the seeking out and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events, such as sweet-tasting foods or sexual interaction. However, ita importance to addiction research goes beyond its role in &quot;natural&quot; motivation:  while the specific site or mechanism of action may differ, all known drugs of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This may happen directly, such as through blockade of the dopamine re-uptake mechanism (see [[cocaine]]). It may also happen indirectly, such as through stimulation of the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens (see [[opiates]]). The euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are thought to be a direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine.   

The human body has a natural tendency to maintain [[homeostasis]], and the central nervous system is no exception. Chronic elevation of dopamine will result in a decrease in the number of dopamine [[Transmembrane receptor|receptors]] available in a process known as [[downregulation]]. The decreased number of receptors changes the permeability of the cell membrane located post-synaptically, such that the post-synaptic neuron is less excitable- ie, less able to respond to chemical signalling with an electrical impulse, or [[action potential]]. It is hypothesized that this dulling of the responsiveness of the brain's reward pathways contributes to the inability to feel pleasure, known as [[anhedonia]], often observed in addicts. The increased requirement for dopamine to maintain the same electrical activity is the basis of both [[physiological tolerance]] and [[withdrawal]] associated with addiction.

Downregulation can be classically conditioned. If a behavior consistently occurs in the same environment or contigently with a particular cue, the brain will adjust to the presence of the conditioned cues by decreasing the number of available receptors in the absence of the behavior. It is thought that many drug overdoses are not the result of a user taking a higher dose than is typical, but rather that the user is administering the same dose in a new environment.  

In cases of physical dependency on [[depressant]]s of the [[central nervous system]] such as opioids, [[barbiturate]]s, or alcohol, the absence of the substance can lead to symptoms of severe physical discomfort. Withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines (valium-family) can result in seizures and even death. By contrast, withdrawal from opioids, which can be extremely uncomfortable, is rarely if ever life-threatening. In cases of dependence and withdrawal, the body has become so dependent on high concentrations of the particular chemical that it has stopped producing its own natural versions (endogenous ligands) and instead produces opposing chemicals. When the addictive substance is withdrawn, the effects of the opposing chemicals can become overwhelming. For example, chronic use of sedatives (alcohol, [[barbiturate]]s, or benzodiazepines) results in higher chronic levels of stimulating [[neurotransmitter]]s such as glutamate. Very high levels of glutamate kill nerve cells (called excitatory neurotoxicity).

==Criticism==
[[Levi Bryant]] has criticized the term and concept of ''addiction'' as counterproductive in psychotherapy as it defines a patient's identity and makes it harder to become a ''non-addict''.  &quot;The signifier 'addict' doesn't simply describe what I am, but initiates a way of relating to myself that informs how I relate to others.&quot;

A stronger form or criticism comes from [[Thomas Szasz]], who denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem.  In many of his works, he argues that addiction is a choice, and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than, say, a low risk lifestyle.  In 'Our Right to Drugs', Szasz cites the biography of [[Malcolm X]] to corroborate his economic views towards addiction: Malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his heroine addiction.  Szasz postulates that humans always have a choice, and it is foolish to call someone an 'addict' just becuase they prefer a [[drug]] induced [[euphoria]] to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle.

A similar conclusion to that of Thomas Szasz may also be reached through very different [[reasoning]].  This is the somewhat extreme, yet tenanable, view that humans do not have [[free will]]. From this perspective, being 'addicted' to a substance is no different than being 'addicted' to a job that you work everyday.  Without the assumption of free will, every human action is the result of the naturally occuring reactions of particle matter in the physical brain, and so there is no longer room for the concept of 'addiction', since, in this view, choice is an illusion of the [[human]] experience.

==Casual addiction==
The word addiction is also sometimes used colloquially to refer to something a person has a passion for. Such &quot;addicts&quot; include:

*[[Bibliophilia|Biblioholics]]
*[[Chocoholic]]s
*[[Workaholic]]s

In [[epistemology]], an '''axiom''' is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] truth upon which other knowledge must rest, from which other knowledge is built up.  Not all [[epistemologist]]s agree that any axioms, understood in that sense, exist. 

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom''' is ''not'' necessarily a ''self-evident'' truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in a deduction to yield further results. Mathematics distinguishes two types of axioms: [[#Logical axioms|logical axioms]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|non-logical axioms]].

==Etymology==

The word ''axiom'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word
&amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omega;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha; (''axioma''), which means that which is deemed worthy or fit or that which is considered [[self-evidence|self-evident]].  The word comes from &amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu; (''axioein''), meaning to deem worthy, which in turn comes from &amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''axios''), meaning worthy. Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

==Mathematics==

In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: '''logical axioms''' and '''non-logical axioms'''. 

===Logical axioms===

These are certain [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Formula|formulas]] in a [[Mathematical logic#Definition:FirstOrderLanguage|language]] that are [[Mathematical logic#Definition:ValidFormula|universally valid]], that is, formulas that are [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Satisfaction|satisfied]] by every [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Structure|structure]] under every [[Mathematical logic#Definition:VariableAssignmentFunction|variable assignment function]] . In colloquial terms, these are statements that are ''true'' in any possible universe, under any possible interpretation and with any assignment of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology|tautologies]] in the language.

====Examples====

In the [[propositional calculus]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulas of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulas of the language:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are propositional variables, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed.

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Example.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; be a first-order language. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Mathematical logic#Definition:FirstOrderLanguage|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of &quot;primitive notions&quot;, either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; (or, for all what matters, &quot;to be equal&quot;) has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt; has to be enforced, and [[mathematical logic]] does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example, is that which provides us with what is known as '''universal instantiation''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Example.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Term|term]] &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Mathematical logic#Definition:VariableSubstitutionInFormula|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x. \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and that if &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a &quot;proof&quot; of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''existential generalization''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom scheme.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a term &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; that is substitutable for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t \to \exists x. \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===

'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''tautologies''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas. This turned out to be impossible and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]'').

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical discourse.  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some [[group (algebra)|groups]], the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''deductive system'''.

====Examples====

This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] (sometimes referred to as ''the theory of functions of one real variable''), [[linear algebra]], and [[complex analysis]] (a.k.a. ''complex variables''), are often introduced non-axiomatically in mostly technical studies, but any rigorous course in these subjects always begins by presenting its axioms.

''Geometries'' such as [[Euclidean geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]]. Interestingly one of the results of the fifth Euclidean axiom being a non-logical axiom is that the three angles of a triangle do not by definition add to 180¬∞. Only under the umbrella of Euclidean geometry is this always true.

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. 
The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[axiomatic set theory]], [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

=====Arithmetic=====

The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed G√∂del to establish his famous [[G√∂del's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;((\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}\,&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N\,&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====

Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[plane geometry]].  This set of axioms turns out to be incomplete, and many more postulates are necessary to rigorously characterize his geometry ([[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] used 23).

The axioms are referred to as &quot;4 + 1&quot; because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] (&quot;through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel&quot;) was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that no parallels through a point outside a line exist, that exactly one exists, or that infinitely many exist.  These choices give us alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to less than, exactly, or more than a straight line respectively and are known as [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]], [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries.

=====Real analysis=====

The object of study is the [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''complete ordered field''. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[L√∂wenheim-Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===

====Deductive systems and completeness====

A '''deductive system''' consists, of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}\,&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as &quot;everything that is true is provable&quot;, but it must be understood that &quot;true&quot; here means &quot;made true by the set of axioms&quot;, and not, for example, &quot;true in the intended interpretation&quot;.  [[G√∂del's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly-used type of deductive system.

Note that &quot;completeness&quot; has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[G√∂del's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of '''''completeness of a deductive system''''' and on the other hand that of '''''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms'''''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===

Early [[mathematician]]s regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic.  [[√âvariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted, but that the grand parallels between axiomatic systems could be put to good use, as he algebraically solved many classical geometrical problems.  Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view we may take as axioms any set of formulas we like, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

:''For other uses, see [[Alpha]].''

'''Alpha''' (uppercase Œë, lowercase Œ±) is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]].  In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 1. It derives from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Aleph (letter)|'Aleph]][[Image:phoenician_aleph.png|20px|Aleph]]. Letters that arose from Alpha include the Latin [[A]] and the Cyrillic letter [[A (Cyrillic)|A]].

[[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' presents a discussion on the question of why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Plutarch's speaker suggests that [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenician]] who reputedly settled in [[Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, &quot;placed ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]], which they, like [[Hesiod]], considered not the second or third, but the first of necessities.&quot; This refers to a passage in ''[[Works and Days]]'' by Hesiod, who advised the early Greek farmers, &quot;First get an ox, then a woman.&quot;  A simpler explanation is that it was the first letter in the Phoenician alphabet.

According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]]. Oxen were also associated with the Moon in both early [[Sumerian]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] religious symbolism due to the crescent shape of their horns.

Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something.  [[Jesus]] declares himself to be the &quot;Alpha and [[Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8).

The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|latin A]].

The lower-case letter Œ± is used as the symbol for the following in physics:
* [[Angular acceleration]].
* The [[alpha particle]] and [[alpha decay]].

'''Alvin Toffler''' (born [[October 3]], [[1928]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] and [[futures studies|futurist]], known for his works discussing the [[digital revolution]], [[communications revolution]], [[corporate revolution]] and [[technological singularity]]. A former associate editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, his early work focused on technology and its impact (through effects like [[information overload]]). Then he moved to examining the reaction of and [[Social change|changes in society]]. His later focus has been on the increasing power of [[21st century]] military hardware, weapons and technology proliferation, and [[capitalism]]. He is married to [[Heidi Toffler]], also a writer and futurist.

== His ideas ==

Toffler explains, &quot;Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest.  Society needs people who work in hospitals.  Society needs all kinds of skill that are not just cognitive; they're emotional, they're affectional.  You can't run the society on data and computers alone.&quot;

In his book ''The Third Wave'' Toffler describes three types of societies, based on the concept of 'waves' - each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside.
*First Wave is the society after [[agrarian revolution]] and replaced the first [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures.
*The main components of the Second Wave society are [[nuclear family]], factory-type education system and the [[corporation]]. Toffler writes: &quot;The Second Wave Society is industrial and based on [[mass production]], [[mass distribution]], [[mass consumption]], [[mass education]], [[mass media]], [[mass recreation]], [[mass entertainment]], and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. You combine those things with [[standardization]], [[centralization]], concentration, and synchronization, and you wind up with a style of [[organization]] we call [[bureaucracy]].&quot; 
*Third Wave is the [[post-industrial]] society. Toffler would also add that since late 1950s most countries are moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society.  He coined lots of words to describe it and mentions names invented by other people, like the [[Information Age]].

In this post-industrial society, there is a lot of diversity in [[lifestyle]]s (&quot;subcults&quot;).
[[Adhocracy|Adhocracies]] (fluid organizations like, say, the [[Wikipedia community]]) adapt quickly to [[change]]s.
[[Information]] can substitute most of the material resources (see [[ersatz]]) and becomes the main material for workers ([[cognitarian]]s instead of [[proletarian]]s), who are loosely affiliated.
[[Mass customization]] offers the possibility of cheap, personalized, production catering to small niches (see [[Just In Time]] production).
The gap between producer and consumer is bridged by technology.
&quot;[[Prosumer]]s&quot; can fill their own needs (see [[open source]], [[assembly kit]], [[freelance]] work).

Since the 1960s, people have been trying to make sense of the impact of new technologies and social change. Toffler's writings have been influential beyond the confines of scientific, economic and public policy discussions.  [[Techno music]] pioneer [[Juan Atkins]] cites Toffler's phrase &quot;techno rebels&quot; in ''Future Shock'' as inspiring him to use the word &quot;techno&quot; to describe the [[musical genre|musical style]] he helped to create.

Toffler's works and ideas have been subject to various criticism, usually with the same argumentation used against [[future studies|futurology]], that is that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible. In the 1990s, his ideas were publicly lauded by [[Newt Gingrich]].

[[Image:Firstissue.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (Volume 1), March 1963, by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is the title of a [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], a [[television program]] and a daily [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]]. All three feature the adventures of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].

==Comic book ==

Spider-Man originally appeared in issue #15 of the comic book ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', its final issue.  The series was cancelled with that issue, but response to the character was so positive that the new title, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was launched, issue #1 appearing in March 1963.

The character was created by writer/editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/cowriter [[Steve Ditko]], and the pair produced 38 issues of ''Amazing''.  A disagreement over a story led to Ditko leaving the title after that point.  He was replaced by penciller [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]] who illustrated Lee's stories for several years. Although many fans thought that the writing quality almost instantly plummeted, the series became still more popular.

Many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic over the years chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero. The title was published continuously until 1998 when Marvel Comics decided to begin anew by renumbering the title with a new issue #1 published in January, 1999. In 2003 this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, at issue #500.

As of October 2005, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is participating in &quot;[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]&quot;, a 12-part crossover, which will conclude in January 2006.

[[Image:Blackissue.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''The Black Issue'' which is just a black background.]]
===Black Issue===

An issue of Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 2) called &quot;The Black Issue&quot; explores how Spider-Man and other heroes would react to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr]]. It starts with a double page spread of the devastation and of Spidey holding his head in pain/anguish/disbelief, his only word &quot;...God...&quot; The issue continues as Spidey swings down to help in the aftermath. Joining with other heroes in the rescue efforts, Spidey explores the wreckage and the broken hearts and his thoughts drive on, thinking through it all. At some point his thoughts become Straczynski's reflections and response. The script journeys from horror, pain and loss to end on strength.

==Television program==
{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)}}
Spidey got his shot at live-action TV stardom in April 1977, when he debuted in the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; TV series.  Nicholas Hammond portrayed Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the short-lived series, which had started out as a slew of TV-movies, obviously made to capitalize on the [[The Incredible Hulk]] television series.  The show was canceled a year after its debut.

==Newspaper comic strip==

The daily newspaper comic strip began on [[January 3]], [[1977]]. It was first written by Spider-Man co-creator [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]].  The strip was surprisingly successful in an era with few serialized adventure strips.  The strip slowly grew in circulation and [[as of 2006]] is still being published.  Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] illustrated and later wrote the strip for much of its run. While the strip and the comic book feature the same characters, they do not share the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], and the strip has had a decreased emphasis on [[supervillain]] enemies.  A rare exception was the 1987 wedding of [[Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] which occurred in both the comic book and the comic strip.  Guest stars in the newspaper strip include [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Dr. Strange]].  Villains include [[Dr. Doom]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[The Rhino]].  Stories from the strip have been reprinted in paperback and in [[Comics Revue]] magazine.

==Video and computer games==
{{see details|Spider-Man (games)}}
Numerous video and computer games have been released whereby the player controlled Spider-Man and had to do battle with various enemies.

==Trivia==
The 2004 movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was at one point tentatively titled ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Antigua and Barbuda infobox}}
'''Antigua and Barbuda''' is an [[island nation]] located in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on the boundary with the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Antigua]] ({{IPA2|√¶nÀàtiÀêg…ô}}) and [[Barbuda]] ({{IPA2|b…ërÀàbjuÀêd…ô}})are located in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the Eastern [[Caribbean]], roughly 17 degrees north of the equator. Antigua and Barbuda are part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] [[archipelago]] with the archipelago of [[Guadeloupe]] to the south, [[Montserrat]] to the southwest, [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] to the west and [[Saint Barth√©lemy]] and [[Saint Martin]] to the northwest. 
== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Pre-ceramic [[Amerindian]]s were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and [[Barbuda]] in [[2400 BC]]. Later [[Arawak]] and [[Carib]] [[Amerindian]] tribes populated the islands. The island of Antigua was originally named Wadadli by the natives.  [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on his second voyage in 1493 and gave the island the name Antigua. Early settlements by the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[France|French]] were succeeded by the [[United Kingdom|English]] who formed a [[colony]] in 1667 by transporting [[Irish Catholic]] slaves to Antigua. [[Slavery]], established to run the [[sugar]] plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. 

The islands became an independent state within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on [[1 November]] [[1981]], and [[Vere Bird]] became the first [[prime minister]].

== Politics ==
''Main article:'' [[Politics of Antigua and Barbuda]]

Antigua and Barbuda is a [[Commonwealth Realm]] and the [[head of state]] is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], who is represented in Antigua and Barbuda by a [[governor general]]. [[executive branch|Executive power]] is in the hands of the [[prime minister]], who is also the [[head of government]]. The prime minister is usually the leader of the winning party of the elections for the [[House of Representatives of Antigua and Barbuda|House of Representatives]] (17 members), held every five years. The other chamber of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|parliament]], the [[Senate of Antigua and Barbuda|Senate]], has 17 members which are appointed by the governor general. Its current prime minister is [[Baldwin Spencer]] ([[24 March]] [[2004]]-).

== Administrative Divisions ==
''Main article: [[Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

The island of Antigua is divided into six [[parish]]es:-

{|
|
*&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint George Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint George]]
*&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint John Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John]]
*&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Mary Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Mary]]
|
*&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Paul Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Paul]]
*&lt;small&gt;5&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Peter Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Peter]]
*&lt;small&gt;6&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Philip Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Philip]]
|
[[Image:Antigua_parishes_numbered.png|right|px150|The Parishes of Antigua]]
|}

The island of [[Barbuda]] and the uninhabited island of [[Redonda]] each enjoy dependency status.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Antigua and Barbuda map.png|250px|thumb|right| ]] 
:''Main article: [[Geography of Antigua and Barbuda]]''
The country consists of a number of islands, of which Antigua is the largest one, and the most populated. [[Barbuda]], just north of Antigua is the other main island. The islands have a warm, tropical [[climate]], with fairly constant temperatures year round. The un-inhabited island of [[Redonda]] also belongs to the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

The islands are mostly low-lying, with the highest point being [[Boggy Peak]], at 402 [[metre]]s (1,319 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The small country's main town is the capital [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John's]] on Antigua; Barbuda's largest town is [[Codrington]].

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

[[Tourism]] dominates its economy, accounting for more than half of its [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Weak tourist arrival numbers since early 2000 have slowed the economy, however, and pressed the government into a tight fiscal corner. The dual-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labour (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work. 

[[Manufacturing]] comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the [[United States]], which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Most of the population are descendants of the slaves that used to work in the sugar plantations, but there are also groups of Europeans, notably [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]], British and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. While the official language is [[English language|English]], most of the locals speak [[patois]], a form of [[Creole language#English Creole|Creole English]].

Almost all Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglican Church]] (about 44%) being the largest denomination.

==Foreign relations==
''Main article: [[Foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]], [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], and the Eastern Caribbean's [[Regional Security System]].

'''''A Man for All Seasons''''' is a play by [[Robert Bolt]], first performed in [[London]] on [[July 1]] [[1960]]. It has subsequently been made into a feature film and a television movie.

{{spoiler}}

The plot is based on the true story of Sir [[Thomas More]], the [[16th century|16th-century]] Chancellor of [[England]], who refuses to endorse or denounce the [[monarch|king's]] wish to divorce his aging wife so that he can marry his mistress. The King is [[Henry VIII of England]] and his wife is [[Catherine of Aragon]], the first of an eventual six.  

The play portrays More as a man of principle, envied by rivals such as [[Thomas Cromwell]] and loved by the common people and by his family.  

[[Image:A Man for All Seasons.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Thomas More ([[Paul Scofield]]) is accused of [[high treason]] by Cromwell ([[Leo McKern]]) - 1966 film]] [[Paul Scofield]], who played the leading role in the [[West End]], reprised it on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[1962]], winning a [[Tony Award]], and played More again in the first of two film versions ([[1966]]), winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in the process. The film also stars [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Henry VIII, [[Orson Welles]] as [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey|Wolsey]], a young [[John Hurt]] as More's nemesis [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and an older [[Wendy Hiller]] as More's second wife. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]]. In addition to the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] won by Scofield, the film won [[Academy Awards]] for screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|cinematography]], costume design, [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].  

The [[1988]] version stars [[Charlton Heston]] (who also directed it) as More, [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (who appeared briefly in the [[1966]] version as [[Anne Boleyn]]) as More's wife, and Sir [[John Gielgud]] as Cardinal Wolsey.

More recently, the play has been staged in London's West End at the [[Theatre Royal]], Haymarket starring [[Martin Shaw]] and produced by [[Bill Kenwright]].  It closes on [[1 April]] [[2006]].

==Quotation==
[[Image:man4all.JPG|thumb|200px]]

'''Alice:'''    Arrest him!

'''More:'''     Why, what has he done? 

'''Margaret:''' He's bad! 

'''More:'''     There is no law against that. 

'''Roper:'''    There is! God's law! 

'''More:'''     Then God can arrest him. 

'''Roper:'''    Sophistication upon sophistication. 

'''More:'''     No, sheer simplicity. The law, Roper, the law. I know what's legal, not what's right. And I'll stick to what's legal. 

'''Roper:'''    Then you set man's law above God's! 

'''More:'''     No, far below; but let me draw your attention to a fact -- I'm not God. The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain sailing, I can't navigate. I'm no voyager. But in the thickets of the law, oh, there I'm a forrester.I doubt if there's a man alive who could follow me there, thank God. 

'''Alice:'''    While you talk, he's gone! 

'''More:'''     And go he should, if he was the Devil himself, until he broke the law! 

'''Roper:'''    So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law! 

'''More:'''     Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? 

'''Roper:'''    I'd cut down every law in England to do that! 

'''More:'''     Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast -- man's laws, not God's -- and if you cut them down -- and you're just the man to do it -- do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.
 
----
'''More:'''     It profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ... but for Wales, Richard?

'''Azincourt''' (sometimes: '''Agincourt''') is a village and [[commune in France|commune]] of northern [[France]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] ''[[d√©partment]]'', 14 miles to the north-west of [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise]] by road, famous on account of the victory, on [[October 25]] [[1415]], of [[Henry V of England]] over the French in the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Population (1999): 276.

The original museum of the battle featuring model knights fabricated from [[Action Man]] has given way to a more professional space with slide shows, audio commentary's and some interactive elements. The museum building is itself modelled on the [[English longbow]] of the English soldiers.

[[Image:speer portrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Albert Speer]]

{{Audio|De-Albert_Speer.ogg|'''Albert Speer'''}} ([[March 19]], [[1905]] &amp;ndash; [[September 1]], [[1981]]) was born ''Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer'' in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]], the second of three sons. He is sometimes called 'the first architect of the [[Third Reich]]'. He  was [[Hitler|Hitler's]] chief [[architect]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[1942]] became Hitler's minister of armaments, when he had considerable success in reforming and streamlining Germany's war production. After the war he was tried at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] where he expressed remorse and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. After his release, he became a successful author, writing a number of semi-autobiographical works until his death in 1981 from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

==Early years==
Although Speer originally wanted to become a [[mathematics|mathematician]] when he was young, he ended up following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture. He began his architectural studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; his decision to study locally instead of at one of the more prestigious institutes was dictated by the inflation of 1923. In 1924 when the inflation had stabilised, Speer transferred his studies to the more esteemed Munich Institute of Technology. In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the Berlin Institute of Technology. It was there that he was under the tutelage of [[Heinrich Tessenow]], Speer had a high regard for Tessenow and when he passed his exams in 1927 he became Tessenow's assistant. His duties as assistant involved teaching seminar classes three days a week. Although Tessenow himself never agreed with [[Nazism]], a number of his students did, and it was they who persuaded Speer to attend a [[Nazi Party]] rally in a Berlin beer-hall in December 1930. 

Speer claims to have been apolitical as a young man; nevertheless, he did attend the rally. He was surprised to find Hitler dressed in a neat blue suit, rather than the brown uniform seen on Nazi Party posters. Speer claimed to have been quite affected, not only with Hitler's proposed solutions to the threat of communism and his renunciation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], but also with the man himself. Several weeks later he attended another rally, though this one was presided over by [[Goebbels|Joseph Goebbels]]. Speer was disturbed by the way he had whipped the crowd into a frenzy, playing on their hopes. Although Goebbels' performance offended Speer, he could not shake the impressions Hitler made on him. The next day he joined the Nazi Party as member number 474,481. In this same year ([[1931]]) he married [[Margarete Weber]].

Speer's first major commission as a Party member came in [[1932]] when [[Karl Hanke]] (whose [[villa]] Speer previously worked on) recommended him to Goebbels to help renovate the new District Headquarters in [[Berlin]], and, later, to renovate Goebbels' [[Propaganda]] Ministry.  Goebbels was impressed with his work and recommended him to Hitler, who assigned him to help [[Paul Troost]] renovate the Chancellery in Berlin.  Speer's most notable work on this assignment was the addition of the famous balcony from which Hitler often presented himself to crowds that assembled below. Speer subsequently became a prominent member of Hitler's inner circle and a very close friend to him, winning a special place with Hitler that was unique amongst the Nazi leadership. Hitler, according to Speer, was very contemptuous towards anybody he viewed as part of the [[bureaucracy]], and prized fellow artists like Speer whom he felt a certain kinship with, especially as Hitler himself had previously entertained architectural ambitions.

==First Architect of the Reich==
When Troost died in [[1934]], Speer was chosen to replace him as the Party's chief architect.  One of his first commissions after promotion was perhaps the most familiar of his designs: the [[Zeppelintribune]], the [[Nuremberg]] parade grounds seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda masterpiece, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In his autobiography, Speer claimed that, upon seeing the original design, he made a derogatory remark to the effect that the parade ground would resemble a &quot;rifle club&quot; meet. He was then challenged to create a new design.

The grounds were based on ancient [[Doric order|Doric]] architecture of the [[Pergamon Altar]] in [[Anatolia]], but magnified to an enormous scale, capable of holding two hundred and forty thousand people.  At the 1934 Party rally on the parade grounds, Speer surrounded the site with one hundred and thirty [[anti-aircraft]] [[searchlight|searchlights]].  This created the effect of a &quot;cathedral of light,&quot; (which referenced [[columns]]) or, as it was called by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ambassador|Ambassador]] [[Sir Neville Henderson]], a &quot;cathedral of ice&quot;.

Nuremberg was also to be the site of many more official Nazi buildings, most of which were never built; for example, the German Stadium would have held another four hundred thousand spectators as the site of the [[Aryan Games]], a proposed replacement for the [[Olympic Games]].  While planning these buildings, Speer invented the theory of &quot;[[ruin value]].&quot;  According to this theory, enthusiastically supported by Hitler, all new buildings would be constructed in such a way that they would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins thousands of years in the future.  Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of the [[Third Reich]], just as ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins were symbols of the greatness of their civilizations.  
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:German pavilion 1937 exhibition.jpg|frame|right|Speer's German pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]].]] --&gt;

In [[1937]] Speer designed the [[Germany|German]] Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale de Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]]. Speer's work was located directly across from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Pavilion and was designed to represent a massive defense against the onslaught of [[communism]]. Both pavilions were awarded gold medals for their designs.

Speer was also directed to make plans to rebuild Berlin, which was to become the [[capital]] of a &quot;Greater Germany&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Welthauptstadt Germania]]. The first step in these plans was the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], designed by [[Werner March]]. Speer also designed the [[new German Reichs Chancellery|new Reichs Chancellery]], which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]].  Hitler wanted him to build a third, even larger Chancellery, although it was never begun.  The second Chancellery was damaged by the [[Battle of Berlin]] in [[1945]] and was eventually demolished  by the Soviet occupiers after the war.
[[Image:Adolf Hitler in Paris.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Speer (left) with Hitler and [[Arno Breker]] in Paris, [[June 23]], [[1940]].]]

Almost none of the other buildings planned for Berlin were ever built. Berlin was to be reorganized along a central three-mile-(five km) long avenue.  At the north end, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'' &amp;mdash; an enormous [[dome|domed]] building, based on [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].  The dome of the building would have been impractically large; it would be over seven hundred feet (over two hundred meters) high and eight hundred feet (three hundred meters) in diameter, sixteen times larger than the dome of St. Peter's.  At the southern end of the avenue would be an [[arch]] based on the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, but again, much larger; it would be almost four hundred feet (120 m) high, and the Arc de Triomphe would have been able to fit inside its opening.  The outbreak of [[World War II]] in [[1939]] led to the abandonment of these plans.

During his involvement in the rebuilding of Berlin, he was allegedly responsible for the forced evictions of [[Jew]]s from their houses to make room for his grand plans, and for re-housing German citizens affected by this work. He was also listed as being present at the 1943 [[Posen Conference]], a charge Speer later contested by saying that he had in fact left early.

Speer did have an architectural rival: [[Hermann Giesler]], whom Hitler also favored.  There were frequent clashes between the two in regard to architectural matters and in closeness to Hitler.

==Minister of Armaments==
Hitler was always a strong supporter of Speer, in part because of Hitler's own frustrated artistic and architectural visions. A strong affinity developed between Hitler and the ambitious young architect early in their professional relationship. For Speer, serving as architect for the head of the German state and being given virtual ''carte blanche'' as to expenses, presented a tremendous opportunity. For Hitler, Speer seemed to be capable of translating Hitler's grandiose visions into tangible designs which expressed what Hitler felt were [[Nazism|National Socialist]] principles.

After Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Fritz Todt]] was killed in an airplane crash in [[1942]], Hitler appointed Speer as his successor in all of his posts. Hitler's affinity for Speer and the architect's efficiency and avoidance of party squabbling are believed to have been considerations in Speer's promotion. In his autobiography, Speer recounts that the power-hungry but lazy [[Hermann G√∂ring]] raced to Hitler's headquarters upon word of Todt's death, hoping to claim the office. Hitler instead presented G√∂ring with the ''fait accompli'' of Speer's appointment. 

Faced with this new responsibility, Speer tried to put the German economy on a war footing comparable to that of the [[Allied]] nations, but found himself incessantly hindered by party politics and lack of cooperation from the Nazi hierarchy. Nevertheless, by slowly centralizing almost all industry control and cutting through the dense [[bureaucracy]], he succeeded in multiplying war production four times over the next two and a half years, with it actually reaching its peak in 1944 during the height of the [[Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II | strategic bombing campaign]]. Another big hurdle in his way was the Nazi policy excluding women from factory work, a serious hindrance in war production and a problem unknown to Germany's enemies, who all made full use of the female workforce. To fill this gap, Speer made heavy use of foreign labor, a considerable portion of it [[forced labor]].

Speer was considered one of the more &quot;rational&quot; members of the Nazi hierarchy, in contrast to the raging [[Hitler]], grotesque [[Hermann G√∂ring|G√∂ring]], fanatical [[Goebbels]], and perverse [[Himmler]].
Speer's name was found on the list of members of a post-Hitler government envisioned by the [[July 20 plot]] to kill Hitler.
However, the list had an annotation &quot;if possible&quot; by his name, which Speer credits with helping save his life from the extensive purges that followed the scheme's failure.
By his own account, Speer considered [[assassin|assassinating]] Hitler in [[1945]] by releasing poison gas into the air intake vent on the [[F√ºhrerbunker]], but backed down for a number of reasons. Independent evidence for this is sparse. Some credit his revelation of this plan at the [[Nuremberg trials]] as being pivotal in sparing him the [[death sentence]], which the [[Soviet]]s had pushed for.

Hitler continued to consider Speer trustworthy, though this trust waned near the war's end as Speer, at considerable risk, campaigned clandestinely to prevent the implementation of Hitler's [[scorched earth]] policy on both German soil and occupied territories. Speer worked in association with General [[Gotthard Heinrici]], whose troops fighting in the east retreated to the American-held lines and surrendered there instead of following Hitler's orders to make what would have been a suicidal effort to hold off the Soviets from Berlin.

Speer even confessed to Hitler shortly before the dictator's suicide that he had disobeyed, and indeed actively hindered, Hitler's &quot;scorched-earth&quot; decree.
According to Speer's autobiography, Speer visited the [[F√ºhrerbunker]] towards the end and stated gently but bluntly to Hitler that the war was lost and expressed his opposition to the systematic destruction of Germany while reaffirming his affection and faith in Hitler. This conversation, it is said, brought Hitler to tears. In disfavor, Speer was excluded from the new cabinet Hitler outlined in his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler |  final political testament]], where Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl-Otto Saur]].

==After the war==

===Nuremberg trials===
Immediately after the war, there seemed to be little indication that Speer would be charged with [[war crimes]]. Speer traveled unprotected and openly participated in the so-called [[Flensburg government]] for weeks, in the presence of Allied officers. Upon request, he actually held a series of widely-attended lectures for officials of the Allied occupying powers on various topics, including the mistakes made by the Nazi government in industrial and economic affairs (although he never during these lectures spoke about slave labor) and the effectiveness of the Allied [[strategic bombing]] campaigns. Some [[journalists]] and spectators even expected that Speer would be appointed by the occupying powers to help restore Germany's economy. However, any such speculation ended when, after one of these lectures, he was arrested and sent to Nuremberg for trial.
At the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war Speer was one of the few officials to express remorse and plead guilty, but was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in [[Spandau Prison]], [[West Berlin]], largely for his use of slave labor. At the trials, the prosecution introduced as evidence a photograph of Speer visiting the [[Mauthausen]] [[concentration camp]], where he is clearly shown surrounded by emaciated prisoners. The prosecution claimed this proved Speer was well aware of [[The Holocaust|the Holocaust]]. However, Speer held that he was only given a &quot;V.I.P.&quot; tour of the concentration camp, meaning he was never shown the more vile side of the camp's purpose.

According to interviews after his imprisonment, as well as his memoirs, Speer adopted a &quot;see no evil&quot; attitude towards the Nazi atrocities. For example, through one of his friends, [[Karl Hanke]], he learned of [[Auschwitz (concentration camp)|Auschwitz]] and the large number of deaths taking place there. He then purposely avoided visiting the camp or trying to get more information on what was taking place. In his autobiography, he claims that he had no direct involvement or knowledge of the Holocaust, although he faults himself for blinding himself to its existence. He certainly was aware, at least, of harsh conditions for the slave labor and some critics believe that his books understate his role in the atrocities of the era.  [http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/05/11/wspeer11.xml Newly released documents] suggest that Speer knew a lot more about the atrocities than he was telling, but hard evidence for that remains very thin.

One problem with assessments of Speer's complicity in the Holocaust comes from his status in post-war Germany - he became a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) any part in the regime's atrocities. Even today, German historians such as [[Joachim Fest]] tend to have a high opinion of him, while non-German historians take a lower view. As [[film director]] [[Heinrich Breloer]] remarked in the above-linked article:

::''[Speer created] a market for people who said &quot;believe me, I didn't know anything about [the Holocaust]. Just look at the F√ºhrer's friend, he didn't know about it either.&quot;''

===Imprisonment===
:''Main article: [[Spandau Prison]]''

His time in prison, painstakingly documented in his secret prison diary which was later released as ''[[The Spandau Diaries]]'', was described as consisting mainly of a mind-numbing and pedantically enforced daily routine, incessant petty personal rivalry between the seven prisoners, a pervasive and bloated prison [[bureaucracy]], and the passing of many false hopes of premature release. After some time Speer, and most of the others, had established secret lines of communication to the outside world via sympathetic prison staff. Speer made full use of this by, amongst other things, writing innumerable letters to his family (which were restricted to one outgoing page per month under official regulation) and even having money spent on his behalf from a special bank account for a variety of benign purposes.

Speer, as recounted in his diary, made a deliberate effort to make as productive use of his time as possible. In the first decade, this took the form of putting on paper the first draft of his tell-all [[memoirs]], an act Speer considered to be his &quot;duty&quot; to history and his people, he being the sole surviving member of Hitler's inner circle and in possession of knowledge and a degree of objectivity that no other had. As the prison directors both forbade the writing of a memoir and recorded each sheet of paper given to the prisoners, he wrote much of his memoir secretly on toilet paper, tobacco wrappings, and any other material he could get his hands on, and then had the pages systematically smuggled out.

All the while Speer devoted much of his energy and time towards reading books from the prison library, which was organized by fellow prisoner and ex-[[Grand Admiral]] [[Erich Raeder]]. Speer was, more so than the others, a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years alone.{{ref|spandau}} His tastes ranged from Greek drama to famous plays to architectural books and journals, partly from which he collected information for a book he intended to write on the history and function of windows in architecture.

Later, Speer took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work. Heretofore the garden was divided up into small personal plots for each prisoner with the produce of the garden being used in the prison kitchen. When regulations began to slacken in this regard, Speer was allowed to build an ambitious garden, complete with a meandering path, [[rock garden]], and a wide variety of flowers. The garden was even, humorously, centered around a &quot;north-south axis&quot;, which was to be the core design element of Speer and Hitler's new Berlin. Speer then took up a &quot;walking tour of the world&quot; by ordering geography and travel books from the local library and walking laps in the prison garden visualizing his journey. Meticulously calculating every metre traveled, he began in northern Germany, went through the [[Balkans]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[India]], and [[Siberia]], then crossed the [[Bering Strait]] and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence in central [[Mexico]].

===Release===
His release from prison in [[1966]] was a world-wide media event. He then revised and published the several semi-[[autobiography|autobiographical]] books he had begun in prison.  His books, most notably ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''The Spandau Diaries'', which were secretly written during his incarceration and systematically smuggled out, provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era and have become much valued by historians. Speer died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in [[London]], [[England]], on [[September 1]], [[1981]] ‚Äî exactly 42 years after World War II began.

Speer's son, also named Albert, became a successful [[architect]] in his own right, and was responsible for the design of [[Expo 2000]] (the [[world exposition]] that took place in [[Hanover]] in the year 2000), design of the [[Shanghai]] International Automobile City and the Beijing Olympic complex. His daughter [[Hilde Schramm]] became a noted left-wing parliamentarian.

'''Alliaceae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of herbaceous [[perennial]] plants. They are [[monocot]]s, part of [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Asparagales]].

Genus ''[[Allium]]'' includes several important food plants, including [[onion]]s (''Allium cepa''), [[chives]] (''A. schoenoprasum''), [[garlic]] (''A. sativum'' and ''A. scordoprasum''), and [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s (''A. porrum'').

The Alliaceae are closely related to two other families in the order Asparagales, the amaryllis family ([[Amaryllidaceae]]) and the family [[Agapanthaceae]], which includes the single genus ''[[Agapanthus]]''. Based on the close relationship between the three families, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] recognizes the alternative of including the Amaryllidaceae and the Agapanthaceae in family Alliaceae.

== Genera ==
Several genera that were historically classified in the Alliaceae, including ''[[Androstephium]]'', ''[[Bessera]]'', ''[[Bloomeria]]'', ''[[Brodiaea]]'', ''[[Dandya]]'', ''[[Dichelostemma]]'', ''[[Milla]]'', ''[[Petronymphe]]'', ''[[Triteleia]]'', and ''[[Triteleiopsis]]'', are now increasingly thought to represent a separate family, [[Themidaceae]].
